Hey fellow travel enthusiasts! üëã    So here's the scoop - my fianc√©e has been dreaming of a magical Christmas trip to New York but life's thrown us a few curveballs with work school and trying to stash away some cash for our upcoming wedding. But hey I'm all about making dreams come true so I've got a surprise one-day trip to NYC in the works!    We're flying out from Detroit to make the most of our time and thanks to some credit card points the flight is practically a steal (less than 100 bucks out of pocket - woohoo!). Now I need your collective wisdom to plan the perfect day in the Big Apple. Planning to go on December 27th.    We've got around 9 glorious hours to soak in the city's vibes and I want every minute to count. My fianc√©e is a Christmas fanatic so any suggestions for Christmas-themed places or areas would be gold. And here's where I'm turning to you for some guidance:    Must-Visit Places/Restaurants: Where should we go to make this day unforgettable? Any hidden gems or must-see spots?    Transportation: Do we need to rent a car to explore or is there a more convenient way to get around? We'll be landing at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) if you have any other airport suggestion that is closer to the city I can change as I haven't booked yet.    Budget: I don't want to break the bank but I want to make this day special. Think 300-500 bucks will be enough for transportation meals and a bit of holiday splurging?    Your tips and insights will mean the world to us! Thanks a million in advance for helping me pull off this surprise. Can't wait to hear your recommendations! üóΩüéÑ‚úàÔ∏è ,Traveler,New York City,World
I do not take credit as I did not leak this video on YouTube but I did watch it at their orientation as an employee there. I am also not disgruntled; the only reason why most other employees have not leaked or shared it is due to fear of being fired for it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbGrIigaTfs ,Jacob S,,
I read somewhere that it would be a good idea to take a ferry ride to see the NYC skyline. Anyone with suggestions. I will be in NYC end Jan 2024 for 3 days ,Wally-Singapore,New York City,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi-    Staying with family in January in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood in January.    Haven‚Äôt been to NYC since I was a kid but looking for good restaurants in the neighborhood that would be an easy walk.    No dietary concerns open to anything and price point not a factor.    If you had 5 days in that neighborhood where would you go? ,lv2sxm,New York City,"Napa, California"

Hi All    First time positng here.    This is a late family getaway trip so has not been best planned.    We are a family of 5 (2 x Adults and 3 x Chiuldren 15 12 & 10).    This will be our first time in New York and we have flights on hold for JFK landing 26/12/23 and leaving NVY 04/01/24.    Manhattan is quite expensive I have noticed in temrs of hotel costs so i just wanted to know are there any other locations that we can consider beside Manhattan? We can use public transport to get in and out of the city?    The length of stay is purely because we dont want to rush our visit and get to take in everythng we can.    Any help much apprecaited  Sanj ,spacerider666,New York City,"London, United..."

Just double checking paperwork for our trip starting tomorrow and have totally boobed with bookings for the 23rd Dec!    Have the Rockettes Christmas show at Radio City at 4pm and The Nutcracker with New York City Ballet at the Lincoln Center at 8pm...................    Can't change the ballet tickets at all I've found and the Rockettes were booked through Ticketmaster with a hefty admin fee and worse seats are now about a 100$ more per ticket and heaven knows what they'd charge us for admin then so decided we'll do both if we can.    I think it will be possible to do both but obviously I'm not a local and don't know for sure. Does anyone know what time the Rockettes etc finish and if we then have time to get to the Lincoln Centre (and how) to be seated for their start time of 8pm?    As you can imagine I'm in trouble with my husband who is trying to be understanding but then remembering what he paid for the tickets - oops! Would appreciate any advice please ,lovesusa,New York City,Stockton Heath...
I'm planning a 1 night (yes I know!) visit to the falls in late sept. Can anyone comment on the best view hotel please? My budget is to upper 3 figures so I can pick a high floor with a view but....I'd like to take photos not through a window (I guess hotel windows don't generally open) so it's more important that I could have some kind of high viewing platform if possible. Does this exist? As another question then where is the best ground access viewpoint on the Canadian side for photos of the falls?  Many thanks for your reply Brian. ,bfrost666,Niagara Falls,"Exmouth, United..."

Hi everyone! Thinking about coming to the city for the night next Friday the 29th to celebrate my anniversary. Can you guys give me some suggestions on a hotel (I was looking into The Plaza) any delicious restaurants (we are steakhouse snobs love a good meal!) and any romantic ideas for us‚Ä¶ thanks! ,NCW,New York City,New Jersey
This is my first time travelling and have a 17 hour lay over in New York and I‚Äôm looking for recommendations.    Is it worth booking a hotel for that time or not? From my understanding I can just go from JFK to Jamaica Station and then to Pen Station and visa versa so does a Manhattan hotel vs airport hotel matter if I go the hotel route?    Also any recommendations on places to visit whilst I‚Äôm there?    Thanks. ,Ste S,New York City,
We are going to NYC for first time for 5 nights with kids (9 and 10) for Christmas this year. I can get a suite with points at Conrad Midtown or Hyatt Centric (both around same size). Centric is a little cheaper. We are going to 3 shows (1 matinee) visting empire One World Natural History museum rockefeller etc ...    Any idea which hotel is better placed? Is Conrad worth the extra $$?    Thx  J ,ledunk,New York City,Los Angeles
Hi - we have 7:30PM tickets to see The Magic Flute which runs around 2 hours. Add intermission which is 30 minutes I think? We'd like to eat out afterwards at a nice place (steakhouse French American seafood all OK). I'm just not sure when to book the reservation given variability in intermission and how long it will take for us to get to the restaurant. I'm thinking it can't be any earlier than 10PM. Can you recommend a place that's not too far from Lincoln Center (not the Grand Tier we'd prefer to eat elsewhere) that would be open that late? Thank you. ,ThirdGrace,New York City,NYC

I have no intention of going out this NYE but I thought this announcement for the Broadway show Harmony was interesting. It happens to be about TDF dot Com but the discussion applies conceptually to anything other than standing in TS for ten hours:    (This theater is on 47th Street east of 8th Avenue.)    Please note that for New Years Eve December 31 at 2PM your tickets for Harmony will be emailed to you from Telecharge. Due to heightened security and street closures in and around Times Square please note the following. You must arrive to the theater from the west side (8th Avenue) and have your tickets or confirmation to show security for access to the theatre. Cross traffic through the bowtie will be closed to both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Additionally there will be a ban on large bags umbrellas alcohol and water bottles for everyone coming through.    (I'm dubious about water bottles especially since the deaths at those TS concerts in Brazil. But the theater would love to sell more bottled water.) ,obsoperator,New York City,"Bergen County, New..."
Hi    Are there any Times Square restaurants / businesses with decent New Year's ball drop views that are still taking reservations for 2023-24?    With some insulation from the cold possible precipitation crowds etc. and hopefully with restrooms & seating?    I imagine the price would run into the hundreds of USD but probably not in the thousands? Or has inflation pushed up prices that high these days?    What about for future years - what's the process of making reservations like? The problem is the performer lineup is not typically announced until December of that year so if you book really early you have no way to tell if it's an artist/band you'd like to watch.    Thanks. ,Markus E,New York City,"Columbus, Ohio"
After all the help and advice I received from others on this forum I wanted to feedback some key highlights from my recent NYC a trip that included eight of my girlfriends for my significant birthday in the hope it may inform someone elses big trip!    Accommodation  Broadway Plaza Hotel: great location and I highly recommend it! Their renovated rooms are located on the first six floors only anything higher up is still original. I had a renovated Queen room that was generous enough in size. Two of my girlfriends shared a Deluxe room with two queen beds which was a fabulous in size with very generous bathroom and the last room type we had was a Deluxe Junior Suite with two king beds (and a sofa bed) ‚Äì and it was VERY big! Street noise from my 4th floor room was very noticeable that was the only downside.    Food: we were so spoilt for choice that it‚Äôs impossible to choose a favourite between the following.    - Foul Witch. The ‚Äòfire and ice‚Äô the sourdough the sorana beans the veal tortellini the guinea hen‚Ä¶mouthwatering and all in the most brilliant setting (‚Ä¶once we managed to find it!)  - Zaytinya (at the Ritz-Carlton Nomad hotel). I totally endorse the suggestion by @McWhippet of the Ashta - beautifully presented French toast perfect for my birthday breakfast.  - Ulivo Trattoria and Cocktail Bar. The perfect place for my indulgent birthday dinner that started off with cocktails in their front lounge followed by so much Italian deliciousness at their centre table - deep fried burrata anyone?  - Il Florista. We stumbled across this absolute gem and what a find! So simply decorated with such a beautiful fresh vibe. Highly recommend the pappardelle with lemon pecorino black pepper and lavender not to mention their negronis!  - Sicily Osteria. More Italian but a great choice before we saw Hamilton.    Other worthy food mentions include the Grand Central Terminal Oyster Bar Don Antonio‚Äôs for a recovery pizza the night after the big birthday and Pete‚Äôs Tavern at Gramercy Park.    Coffee  - Stumptown coffee at the ACE Hotel = a great skim flat white every morning!  - Eataly Flatiron = also great coffee and a bite-sized something sweet.    Theatre and NY Comedy Festival shows  - Gutenberg! The Musical ‚Äì hilarious!  - Hamilton: why I put off seeing for this so long I will never know ‚Äì fabulous!  - As part of the NY Comedy Festival we were also lucky enough to see Bill Burr at MSG and Jo Koy at The Kings Theatre in Brooklyn ‚Äì what a spectacularly grand theatre!    Tours  - Nice Guys Tours: Lower East Side ‚Äì a great few hours with Adam our guide!  - Secret Food Tours: Greenwich Village ‚Äì again Emily was fabulous as our guide highly recommend.  - Walk City Experience: The Official Grant Central Terminal Tour  - Brooklyn Giro Bike Tours: great four hour ride all through Brooklyn.    Thank you again to all those on this forum for your expertise ‚Äì it really is an invaluable resource! ,Boy046,New York City,"Canberra, Australia"
My wife daughter (12) and i will be attending a game at Madison Square Garden on New Years Day and would love some recommendations for brunch/lunch in advance of the game which starts at 3pm.

I will be visiting NYC for 1 day before continuing on to Cancun after boxing day. I intend to have a walk in Manhattan area after my last visit which is nearly 20 years ago. I fly from London. I have a few questions if anyone could help with?    1) Is there any local sim deal I can get for short stay? I kinda need it when I figure out public transport and when I am in Manhattan... My current UK sim provider does not really have good roaming deal for USA...    2) When I use public transport (JFK airport - lower Manhattan - central park) how should I pay? Can I just tap my credit/debit card?    3) I assume I will be getting away without having any cash for 1 day? If not what's the best place to get small amount of cash?    4) What's the best way to get to lilberty island from Manhattan?

Hello    My Wife and I are planning to make a last-minute trip to NYC for Christmas this year. We'd be arriving around lunchtime on Saturday Dec. 23 and departing at about the same time on Tuesday Dec. 26. Therefore we'll be staying for three nights - and yes I recognize that most everything will be closed on Monday for Christmas Day (our second of only two full days in NYC).    Our primary reasoning for undertaking this trip is just wanting to have a little escape from our typical Christmas. We've been to NYC a few times before over the years but never in the winter. The way everything has worked out this year it seems like a perfect chance for us to experience a bit of Christmas in NYC.    We'll be driving into the city and are okay to pay the cost of parking somewhere close to our hotel. We won't touch our car until we depart and are fine to walk long distances and/or use the subway.    I'm sort of thinking we'd like to stay in the NoMad area as most of our plans radiate from that central zone. So far I'm seeing rates in the high $200's to low $300's for - MADE Hotel Ace Hotel Moxy NYC Chelsea Motto Hilton Chelsea Bryant Park Hotel Refinery Hotel. And I'm suffering analysis paralysis between all of them haha!    Re plans ... we have a dinner reservation at Gallaghers Steakhouse on Sat. Dec. 23 and will be trying to secure Macy's Santaland reservations too (resos seem to open up five days in advance). Other than that I see our plans radiating out from the NoMad area.    To the North - Xmas trees at Rockefeller Center Radio City Music Hall Lotte Palace. Perhaps the Bryant Park Christmas Market. Quick walk-through Times Square (my Wife will need to go to the Disney Store). Gallaghers reso.    To the West ‚Äì Walking the High Line perhaps checking out the Chelsea Market and Starbucks Reserve Roastery.    To the South ‚Äì Macy‚Äôs holiday decor seeing the Flatiron Building.    Obviously we‚Äôll prioritize checking out things that will be closed on Christmas Day on the 23rd and 24th. On Christmas Day I think we‚Äôll just wander around outside perhaps stroll around Central Park check out some fancy hotel lobbies and maybe have dinner in Chinatown.    Any advice re hotels and/or our plans in general would be very much appreciated!    Thanks    Ryan ,RYAN1987M,New York City,"Woodstock, Canada"

Hi  Can you advise me on best way to get from Lake Placid to Manhattan. Will be traveling in early January. I‚Äôve read that the drive is beautiful but will it be a treacherous drive with snow?

Can anyone comment on this experience? First time in NYC at Christmas and I see that you can reserve a time for family photos with the tree or Santa but there's not much other detail. Will the tree photo be a relatively unobstructed pic? How about navigating the crowds to get to the proper location? TIA for any help! ,GrandTour783039,New York City,
Hello to all you beautiful people! As a token of overwhelming support and the wealth of knowledge that I received here wanted to share my travel report. Background: a family of 2 adults and 2 kids (9 and 5 y/o) went to NYC for the first time to celebrate special occasion the week of Thanksgiving.    Hotel: stayed in Indigo on Water Street. Outstanding location for us away from hustle and bustle but in very decent area loved walking Wall St back and force close to metro stations clean and very safe. Hotel: pros: great location new built all things new rooms small but manageable. Cons: 2 double beds were horrible to manage for 2 adults the noise level from plumbing was quite high the service was pretty inattentive forgot on things overall pleasant but lacked customer service in comparison with other brands that we stayed at. The price point was significantly lower in comparison with others so I guess I do not regret this selection.    Dates: 11/19 ‚Äì to 11/24. We felt it was just the right amount of time for the first time. Felt quite tired last days and were ready to head back home. Weather forecast was showing rain and gloomy and it was like that one day but nevertheless it didn‚Äôt impact our itinerary much. We didn‚Äôt even end up going to any museum to wait out the rain just dove into restaurants for dinner and then walked a bit with shopping here and there. That was the last week that was more or less good weather. The week prior to it it was very balmy/fall-ish weather our week was more like a transition and the week that followed up was already winter to me so be very careful with your timing at least for us the last week of November is critical when things change on a dime.    Day 1: SUN arrival into Newark Airport went to taxi stand and ordered taxi. We drove 16 miles for an hour!!! Brutal. Paid close to 140 or so which is not a lot considering the amount of time spent in a car but considering that it‚Äôs only 16 miles crazy! Probably would have been better off taking airport express but again given that we are on Wall Street not too sure. Checked into hotel dropped off luggage and headed to Times Square. It was great to immerse into it right it! Loved it! Exactly how I thought it‚Äôs going to be. Did dinner at Bubba Gump on 2nd floor right in the middle of Times Sq it was great! Then went to M&M World Hershey Chocolate World and Krispy Kreme to watch donuts being glazed and having our dessert time finished off on red stairs then headed back to the hotel walking past Oculus and the nice Xmas decorated park etc.    Day 2: Metro to Macy‚Äôs area had bagels at some bagel place nearby saw Empire State inside/out on the way to Summit Vanderbilt. Had 11 AM time slot. It was INCREDIBLE!!!! Those balloons the rooms the 360 view the terrace all was incredible we were very happy that we selected it out of all observation decks. Very tech advanced experience. I love when things are NEW!!! We finished around 2 there kids were crazy over it! Highly recommend. Then headed to Grand Central Terminal. It was grand but not much to it‚Ä¶. I was expecting more things to do. Went upstairs/downstairs whispering gallery and all but it was maybe 15-20 min. Grabbed Shake Shack takeout and left. I was worried that it will be rainy next days so we hurriedly headed to Central Park. I thought it would be best to walk 30 min since we will walk major drag anyways and will see things but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it. It‚Äôs better just to grab metro and be there sooner. It was getting colder and darker but we still enjoyed Central Park. I was pleasantly surprised to see some foliage. Kids climbed Umpire Rock and were very happy. I had no idea until I googled. There were ton of horse driven carriages and I didn‚Äôt expect that. I thought if you don‚Äôt arrange one no one showed up‚Ä¶. But the smell was unbearable since there were so many of them so we decided to walk through given that it was getting dark. I think I would enjoy horse driven carriage ride if we had more time. The idea was to do carriage first for general overview and then walk inside the park for another hour or so‚Ä¶. Anyways we just walked and made it to that famous bridge that appeared to be closed‚Ä¶. Nice area around fountain nice walk all around grabbed little hot dogs for kids from street vendors. Had reservation at Baekjeong Korean BBQ so once it got dark was rushing to grab subway to get to the Korean Town. It was great experience doing your own BBQ with the set up that they had but my stomach didn‚Äôt handle it well afterwards and we didn‚Äôt feel full no matter how much we eat. Afterwards tried to hit some of the places off Xmas walk list Macy‚Äôs again and their windows inside too for a little shopping Bryant Park and then we heard the music coming through and accidentally hit Rockefeller Center not realizing that it was the one. Lol. Was mesmerized by the Dior Show and 5th Ave Saks window displays! It was fabulous! Called it a night.    Day 3: expecting rain in the afternoon gloomy in the morning quickly headed to Brooklyn Bridge. Took subway to the other side and followed silly google maps for the ‚ÄúDUMBO‚Äù was walking in circles like crazy and couldn‚Äôt find my way. Finally located the famous spot in DUMBO where everyone takes pic of the Manhattan Bridge did that ventured into Market to have some breakfast didn‚Äôt like it at all. I don‚Äôt like places like that. I like something with the view‚Ä¶.. Had lobster rolls at Luke‚Äôs prior to hitting the bridge! Brooklyn Bridge was AMAZING!!! I didn‚Äôt expect the boardwalk to be in the middle and raised I thought that it‚Äôs leveled with cars. It was nice not to deal with traffic noise. The best souvenirs prices were on the bridge. I can imagine how nice it would be during sunset hours. Towards the end it started raining and windy we finished and carried on to 9/11 memorial survivor tree etc. The weather was appropriate for this experience all wet and somber‚Ä¶ Even managed to stand in line to take a photo with charging bull fierce girl etc. I don‚Äôt remember what we had for dinner that day‚Ä¶. Afterwards I was stern on going to Rockefeller Centre thinking that I haven‚Äôt been‚Ä¶. Again came to watch Dior Show went to Lego store shopping then FAO Schwarz and still searching for Rockefeller Center‚Ä¶. Lol. My silly google map was showing me that it‚Äôs further the moment I go further it says to go back‚Ä¶ and I wasn‚Äôt able to understand that it was it! I thought that it would have some sort of official entrance similar to Macy‚Äôs. First I thought that Saks is Rockefeller. Lol. I had a good laugh later‚Ä¶. Went inside St. Patrick‚Äôs. It was nice. Then went back to our hotel and hit the rooftop for some views. The next day supposed to be the worst weather day and I had that SOL reservation so I was bracing for that‚Ä¶.    Day 4: Walk along Wall Street Liberty Bagels for rainbow and liberty donuts and off to the SOL. We had 11.00 AM slot which was perfect for our family. There is no way that we would have made it earlier. We were awoken at 8 AM but it takes a while for us to get out walk around find food etc. Security and lines were very well organized. We had lots of sun despite forecasted rain until later in the day. The whole experience was AMAZING! We did the pedestal access with advance a week out reservation. We did the museum walked around kids absolutely loved it! Like I was saying for our family it was a highlight! We learned a lot we were interested in how it was built its structure museum is simply a must. And those audio guides were the HIGHLIGHTs for the kids. It kept them entertained for hours they felt important to listen to it so they did we talked through if they understood everything etc. Around 3 PM the weather started being cold and windy and we took the boat back. Stopped at the other island but couldn‚Äôt handle another museum so jumped on the same boat again changing our mid on a dime. We headed back and I called randomly without any hope to Oscar Wilde Restaurant! And OMG they actually picked up phone and I managed to book spot for dinner within 30 min arrival. I was eyeing this restaurant for the month and couldn‚Äôt get a spot. The restaurant was fully decked out for Xmas season it was overload of all decorations etc. I was so happy that we made it it was amazing! The service was very mediocre though and the food as well we should have just taken appies and drinks and go somewhere else to eat but we were so tired and the weather wasn‚Äôt the best so we sat there for 2 hours to enjoy and not being able to move. Afterwards we went to another LEGO store that was close by and I spotted that we were close by Flatiron Building and Madison SQ so we walked a bit in the dark to see it. It was all right. You were correct specifically walking to it would be total waste of time. I had that Rosevelt Tram on my list and really didn‚Äôt want to go but we thought we will regret it so we went wasted time on communing there did the tram it was all right it would have been nice in summer to come on the little island and walk around but it was dark and we were so tired that we literally did it for the sake of checking off the box. Returned back to the other side and it took us an hour or so to get to Wall Street. I regret that we did it! nothing special about it at all‚Ä¶.    Day 5: Special occasion day. It took us forever to get to Macy‚Äôs parade. We made it close to 11 saw some things from the distance right beside Radio Hall theater. It was all right like any parade. Kids were a bit bored to stand and watch so we left. It was windy and cold we couldn‚Äôt find place to eat without any lines so just went to Juniors to pick up NYC cheesecake. I quickly bought tickets to Rockettes last minute for 2 PM show. We did the experience it was great! Following it quickly rushed to make it to the restaurant on the other side of the river. Being Thanksgiving I wasn‚Äôt sure if boats will bring us on time so we took bus through the tunnel to make it to the Charthouse. I wanted only window seating so we waited about 20 min for it. The location and the restaurant were AMAZING!!!! I was very worried if it would be good but it turned out the BEST! We came right on sunset the view of Manhattan was INCREDIBLE the water reflection the food everything about it was very very good! I highly recommend and it was so silly of me to have doubts and to take so much time and research the hell out of it when I had Charthouse all this time in front of my eyes! I am sure any other restaurants that I was considering with the view higher up would be less superior than this full view of Manhattan on your palms. Our table was positioned right in the middle of it all and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Afterwards took bus again through the tunnel because didn‚Äôt want to bother to explore anything else we knew the route and we knew where to stand to hop on it. Finished the evening with yet again the visit to Times Square and the Dior Show (it was our 3rd time) and headed to the hotel.    Day 6: woke up and headed to the airport. Although we did have time because our departure was not until 4 PM but we were simply tired and didn‚Äôt want to bother with luggage storage etc‚Ä¶.    Overall I was amazed by all people and atmosphere. All were good looking nicely dressed very courteous and trying to help! I will never forget we were taking turns to take photos of us in front of some building and the guy doing his shift on the service vehicle stopped in the middle of the road got off the vehicle and offered to take a picture of our family together! Like who does it in the big city?! Subways were one of the best ones that I ever seen clean practically no graffiti didn‚Äôt see anything that was not safe people were all probably tourist or commuting to work. This was one of the best city experience that we travelled to. I don‚Äôt get when people say oh I am from New York you know what that means as if it‚Äôs negative connotation. I didn‚Äôt feel that people rushed or made you rush some service was even slower at a time‚Ä¶. All was top notch and we loved everything about it!    Thank you to all of you here who helped along the way. I won‚Äôt re-read for proofreading because must run so don‚Äôt judge for it! I was determined to get it out this year haha if I wait for proofreading potentially it‚Äôs not going to make it this December. ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada

Hello all you helpful people out there! I thought I would follow up all my questions with a post trip update!    We booked NYC as my husband has always wanted to go there. I was hesitant and begrudgingly agreed to go we are scuba divers and there is no scuba diving in NYC‚Ä¶ at least not the kind I want to do!    I must start this update with this‚Ä¶surprisingly‚Ä¶ I LOVED THIS CITY!    Our trip was planned with 3 couples. We were in NYC for 8 days.    My husband and I arrived one day earlier than our friends and flew into JFK - it was the night of the tree lighting so we took the LIRR to Penn Station stayed at The Renaissance Midtown. Our room was good the lobby bar good the club lounge really nice and quiet and comfortable. The location seemed great‚Ä¶    I was initially shocked and almost paralyzed by how busy it was I was also VERY shocked at the garbage around Renaissance‚Ä¶ especially by the 99 cent pizza place‚Ä¶ We figured out we preferred using the back door of the Renaissance Hotel kept us off 35 street which seemed to have more trash from the pizza place :(    Our first night we walked over to Hudson Yards area and it was sooo peaceful and beautiful and quiet. We had dinner at Ci Siamo difficult to find but really really good. How is a restaurant that busy on a weekday night? We quickly figured out it didn‚Äôt matter what day it was!    The next day my husband and I headed over to Dumbo on the Subway and wandered around there‚Ä¶ so charming! Of course we had a Grimaldi‚Äôs pizza for lunch and we loved it! We ate in the restaurant and super enjoyed it! We then walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and walked up to the Union Square Market.    We LOVED the Union Square Market! Bought our animals some homemade dog toys some awesome pine scented candles and fell in love with the ornaments made by wire. So bought a few of those in honour of our rescue dogs and cats. :) After the Union Square Market we walked to Pete‚Äôs Tavern. LOVED it there. I felt I could have sat at the bar all afternoon! Stayed for a couple and then headed out to meet our friends who were arriving! We loved this area‚Ä¶ not sure if it‚Äôs called Gramercy?    What shocked me about NYC is I expected everything to be brown and dead like our city in early winter‚Ä¶ but there is still lots of green even some roses still hanging on by the Brooklyn Bridge.    Our friends arrived late afternoon and we headed out to see all the store windows Rockefeller tree Bryant Park market etc etc. We pretty much walked the whole way down 5th avenue and then subway‚Äôed back. By the end of day 2 we were subway experts‚Ä¶. Haha! Sometimes it‚Äôs just so hard to know if they are going uptown or downtown! We thought the Bryant Park market was just OK‚Ä¶It was super busy!    The next morning we were up early to visit the 911 Memorial and Museum. We had booked a tour and the guide was amazing. We were blown away by the entire experience. We found that after several hours we were emotionally overwhelmed and utterly speechless‚Ä¶ I almost don‚Äôt even know how to write this paragraph 911 touched us and the world beyond imagine for the last 21 years‚Ä¶ but there is nothing that can prepare you for the magnitude of emotion you will feel when you are there. We were honestly left speechless‚Ä¶ we will return again and spend more time as we didn‚Äôt see it all couldn‚Äôt see it all in one visit‚Ä¶.    That afternoon we headed back to Dumbo as we had not eaten yet and I had read something about Lucky Rabbit Noodles‚Ä¶ not sure where. This was honestly our best meal in NYC. It‚Äôs a TINY hole in the wall with amazing food. It was a rainy day and so we sat at the little 4 seater bar and savoured a ‚Äúchef‚Äôs suggestion‚Äù meal‚Ä¶ whatever he thought we should try. It was PHENOMENAL!    I had made reservations at Oscar Wilde for 5pm. I have to admit this is probably our biggest disappointment. The decor is MIND BLOWING! But what I didn‚Äôt expect is that it would be so crowded hot and loud. The music was blaring and considering the decor I would have expected at least one Christmas song every 30 minutes‚Ä¶ nope. Not our vibe‚Ä¶ It was OK to leave because we had somewhere important to go anyway!!!    We walked on over to MSG for the KISS CONCERT! We had been hooked up with a Lexus Suite for the concert! We like Kiss well enough being in the 50 yr old age range‚Ä¶ but we had no clue how much energy there would be at MSG! We walked up to see a huge billboard ‚ÄúKiss SOLD OUT!‚Äù We felt truly like this was one of the hilights of our trip! The Lexus Suite was a fantastic place for us ‚Äúoldies‚Äù to watch the concert and enjoy a few cocktails! What started out as ‚Äúwe got a suite given to us for Kiss‚Äù‚Ä¶. Ended up being ‚Äúthat was the best evening ever!‚Äù    The next day we walked over to Hudson Yards for a 12:00 reservation in Peak Lounge. Enjoyed some of their signature cocktails and the Edge Observation Deck. Mind blowing to be up there the views are spectacular!!! We then walked the High Line and visited Chelsea Market. I loved walking the High Line again the fact that so many of the trees are still green is just so amazing to me I loved that! The Chelsea Market was PACKED! We enjoyed a lobster roll at Lobster Place. Yum!    That night we arranged a private transport with Yellow Moon Tours to go see Dyker Heights Christmas lights. Holy moly the lights are spectacular. But the traffic was so insane what was supposed to be a short evening ended up with us sitting in traffic for far too long‚Ä¶ Not sure if I would do it again it‚Äôs good to see it once but I think once is enough. There was a woman selling Cannoli on one of the front driveways and it was DELICIOUS! On the way back to midtown we stopped and grabbed a few Grimaldi‚Äôs pizzas as our friends had not tried them‚Ä¶ by the time we got back to the hotel they were cold‚Ä¶ no food or drinks in the van. After sitting in a hot van for hours we headed back to our hotel rooms‚Ä¶. Early to bed!    The next day my husband and I were up early and headed to Chinatown the tour guide from the night before had mentioned WeHop restaurant. It was yummy! We had planned to try something from there and then try a few other restaurants but everything looked so good at WeHop we just ate there! Afterwards I grabbed a burnt basque cheese tart at Pink Lady Japanese Bakery. Sort of like a not super sweet cheesecake. YUM!    Afterwards walking back to our hotel I must look like I am late a lot‚Ä¶ because the amount of Rolex watches I was offered to buy was insane! Haha    That afternoon we had tickets to A Beautiful Noise show‚Ä¶. OH‚Ä¶. MY‚Ä¶. GOODNESS!!! IT WAS SO GOOD!!! Our whole group agreed we would see it again! We love Neil Diamond and love music but I truly don‚Äôt believe you have to love him to love this show!    That evening we went on the 8:30pm Carols and Cocoa cruise through Classic Harbour lines. It was a great way to see the Statue of Liberty! We enjoyed it but all agreed doing it once was enough! The views of the city skylines are mind blowing though!    After our cruise we popped into Jack Doyle‚Äôs right next door to The Renaissance. The Christmas decor is fantastic and so is the vibe! We loved it our friends were leaving the next day and so it was a great place to spend our last few hours together. :)    As we were getting back to the hotel a bunch of ‚Äúrockers‚Äù were unloading all their equipment from a van in front of the Renaissance‚Ä¶ turns out it was the opening band from the Kiss concert‚Ä¶ they were shocked and humbled we recognized them! One of these polite young adults is Paul Stanley‚Äôs son. Turns out some were in the hotel room directly next door to us we chatted in the hallway for a bit‚Ä¶ what polite kind young people! They deserve all the success!    We did a 2 hour Central Park tour via fancy apple pedicab tours. It was fine‚Ä¶ I wish we had more time to just walk Central Park. My favourite part of the park was Strawberry Fields. Next time I want to just sit there and enjoy it‚Ä¶ instead of feeling rushed. It was cold though and the cold beat us and we cut the trip short‚Ä¶ before heading down to Tribeca we ate lunch at Sushi 35 next door to the Renaissance‚Ä¶ a tiny hidden jewel above the smoke shop. SO GOOD!    The next 3 days was just my husband and I we moved over to The Greenwich Hotel. Wow‚Ä¶ it was spotless sooooo comfortable and so relaxing‚Ä¶ the staff amazing! Our room was DIVINE!!!! We enjoyed the Shibui Spa there and it was amazing as was the spa pools you can use if you are a guest at the hotel. We LOVED Tribeca! LOVE!!!!! It was so nice after the hustle of midtown! We spent our days just walking‚Ä¶ walked to Soho and back visited Fanelli‚Äôs and loved the vibe there. Did a tiny bit of shopping‚Ä¶. Just lived the vibe of the area and we absolutely LOVED it. My husband even got a haircut in Tribeca! We walked down by the river‚Ä¶ and spent every evening having a nightcap in their lovely hotel lounge in front of the fire.    We loved Tribeca how clean it was. I even watched a restauranteur wash the sidewalk in front of his steakhouse! For some reason I was extremely impressed with that‚Ä¶    We enjoyed dinner at Szechuan Mountain House and it was good‚Ä¶ spicy‚Ä¶ not our fave though. The reviews are super high so maybe it‚Äôs just us.    Our last night we ate dinner at Locanda Verde the restaurant in the hotel. It was good not super great. We liked Ci Siamo much better‚Ä¶    After a long trip report I have a few finishing thoughts‚Ä¶ We loved Tribeca‚Ä¶ the subway is way easier than driving‚Ä¶ bring comfortable shoes if you think they are good enough‚Ä¶. THEY AREN‚ÄôT!! I wish there was less trash! We loved the luxury of The Greenwich Hotel‚Ä¶ but wish the other guests were less stuffy‚Ä¶ AND I wish I had adopted a cat from Beth Stern!!! Haha.    And my final thought‚Ä¶ WHEN CAN WE GO BACK!!! Next time we would do way less scheduled ‚Äútours‚Äù and just spend time enjoying the city like we did in our last 3 days‚Ä¶ I also met the owner of The Lucky Dog‚Ä¶ I want to go there on our next visit it‚Äôs dog friendly! ,Jocjayhay_9,New York City,"Calgary, Canada"
Looking for a recommendation of a good restaurant for a weekend dinner. I have to be down in Brooklyn Heights for an event. Open to any kind of food except not fast food or pizza. Looking for a sitdown restaurant. Have a reservation at Henry's End. I'm extremely familiar with the area but usually down there during the day. Some other places I been looking at Chez Moi and Colonie. Pricewise entrees from $20-$50 per person. Not looking for some place flooded with tourists so probably not Dumbo. ,Bill2474,New York City,
Planning a trip from 1/31 to 2/3 with my husband. Goal is leisure sightsee eat good food drink good drinks anything is game during our short time. Need suggestions on good safe areas and hotels to stay that are not extremely touristy thinking anything $100-300/night.  TIA ,Alach V,New York City,
I'm planning on driving my family of 4 to NYC and staying for 5 nights in the early July timeframe. The car is coming with us although I'm guessing we probably won't use it during our stay. My goal is not to break the bank but at the same time have a fun trip that isn't full of inconveniences like if we stayed way outside Manhattan and end up spending an hour getting to and taking public transportation every day. I see two problems number one being able to find a hotel for a decent price that's also in a decent convenient location (like maybe a convenient spot in Manhattan). Number two parking our car somewhere for 5 days is going to jack that price up much further. It looks like maybe I could find a suitable place somewhere in Manhattan for $200-$250 a night. That's a little painful as I'm used to staying in like a Holiday Inn Express for like $100-$150 a night in most cities around the country but I'll probably have to spend that higher amount in NYC. But then if parking is $50+ a night I might be looking at around $300 per night overall. That's where I'm asking for suggestions. Should I find a place in NJ to park and take a train or ferry to Manhattan with all our luggage (which will probably be a little large being that this will be a 2 week + overall road trip)? Maybe that's worth it since we'll be in town for 5 nights. Or do you recommend we just avoid the hassle of dragging our luggage on trains/ferrys/subways and pay the extra parking fees for either a hotel with parking or finding a garage on our own? Or alternatively is there a borough(?) outside of Manhattan that we could still jump on a convenient subway and get into Manhattan pretty quickly and park rather cheaply and feel safe? I don't know it's such a complicated question because there are so many factors. And there is so much information already on this topic on the internet but a lot of it is from a few years or more back and it feels like a lot has changed since the pandemic. Like many hotels that people suggested in the past with free or cheap parking look like they probably went out of business during the pandemic. So I'm trying to figure out what I should do when I get there in 2024. ,TexAaron,New York City,"Dallas, Texas"

Coming to the city next week with friend and our teenage daughters.

This is a trip report at a Chanukah Party at City Hall    Honestly I had never been to City Hall before As far as I know they dont give tours  Unfortunatly in 2003 a City Councilman was shot and killed and it got more difficult to get inside. I belive you need an invitation to get inside nowadays and this was the first time I was able to snag one.    The city Hall building is a national landmark and was built between 1805 and 1812 . Because of Security you have to go through several security checks there is a metal dector outside and a second security inside.    Once you get inside there is a really cool rotunda and marble staircase. Its too bad this place is not open for tours I(as far as I know) the stairs and rotunda are really cool    The NYC council has 51 members and they range in political afflication from socialists to Maga republicans (There really is more of a political diversity in the council)    In some of these photos you can see some of the council members standing at the Podium. The ones you can see are Julie Menin from Manhattan. Eric Dinowitz from Da Bronx. Lynn Schulman from Queens and Lincoln Resitler from Brooklyn . You can also see the children of Council members Menin and Dinowitz lighting the Chanukah candles. Council Member Dinowitz has twins    Here are the photos  Including the staircase and rotunda    https://imgur.com/gallery/bWxAvws ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City

Bit of a confusing one I am looking at taking my mother and younger sibling to NYC from London next year. I am 20 and would rather have my hotel room if possible. I've found a hotel that is in budget for us I will have my mother as the lead passenger as she is over 21 so can check in but can I book two rooms under her so I can have my own room? I'm not sure how it would work but as I am travelling on the same booking as someone 21+ would It be okay for me to have a seperate room? Just don't wish to share!    Thanks ,fx h,New York City,

You all were so helpful as I picked out a hotel for my December stay and I'm hoping I can get some help for a last minute dinner recommendation for this Friday Dec. 15.    I'm unexpectedly traveling with my mom instead of my husband (a fellow foodie) and I fear she won't like the $$$$ fine dining restaurant we had booked for this Friday night. Thus I am trying to find something well-recommended that won't be booked up at this late date. Her favorite thing to order at a restaurant is a good well-rounded burger that also has good appetizers maybe dessert to share and where we can sit down and have a nice meal. We're not looking for a cheap quick place but a nice mid-range place. We are staying in Midtown but I am open to going to a different part of Manhattan for this meal an area that we can maybe explore a bit before or after as we don't have anything else planned for this evening.    I am also open to recommendations for good well-rounded American food (or with Italian influences) with a similar vibe. I think something like the Gramercy Tavern would be perfect but they're booked obviously.    Overall looking for the $$-$$$ range. I would really like to make a reservation somewhere unless it is a place that doesn't take reservations that we can almost 100% rely on getting a table.    Appreciate any recommendations!! ,Lacey,New York City,"Akron, Ohio"

I am receiving mixed messages from other sources so hoping someone on here has a definitive answer. Arriving at JFK and I'll have a 7 hour wait until from T7.

Visiting NYC with our kids in early January. Kids are ages 6 and 10. With our limited time of 4 nights looking at the following and want to ensure I'm not missing out any must do's. Also looking for recommendations for restaurants and ideally indoor activities. We are staying in downtown Manhatten    Day 1 (afternoon): visit Wall St Battery Park dinner in Little Italy (recommendations please)    Day 2: Statue of Liberty lunch in Chinatown (recommendations please) and head up slightly north to Greewich Village. Dinner in the area (rec's please)    Day 3: Central Park (we're we got engaged) possibly zoo ice skating and museum of Natural History. Dinner at Jojo's.    Day 4: Time Square Empire state building Rockefeller center etc. Not to sure about this day seems a bit too touristy and lacking substance.    Day 5: early flight home :( ,Javier C,New York City,
Thinking we might do this when we come in to the city very early January but had a few questions for those who might have done it within the last month or two.    On your cruise were you guaranteed a window seat? (It will be four of us - adults - so we will have enough to fill such a table no problem). It appears in some online pix that there are also tables in the middle that don't have window views and we would hate to get one of those as we really want to take sunset and nighttime pix.    Also were the lights inside dim enough that it didn't cause reflection problems seeing and taking pictures of the outside views once it got dark? Again asking because photo ops very important. And I would hate to have to go out on the deck for pix at that time of year especially on the water.    Could I contact the cruise line and ask these questions? Yes. Would I get an honest answer that would justify the high cost of the trip? Not sure. That's why I decided to try and get answers from those who might have just done it. Appreciate any first hand knowledge you want to share.    TIA! ,scraphappylady,New York City,Philadelphia...

I have seen several references to taxis that seat 5 people but just wanted to confirm anyone has actually encountered thesse at LaGuardia? We will be 2 adults and 3 kids. We would rather take a taxi than book a car service if possible. We understand we may need to wait longer than others while a larger taxi is located. Thanks if you have any experience with this. ,tarq476,New York City,"Florida, USA"
Hi I heard I could make a trip report so figured I'd let you know how it went! Just got back last night had an awesome trip over the weekend. I had asked about it and gotten great tips from you over here:    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k14594841-o20-First_time_solo_travel_midtown_walking_etc-New_York_City_New_York.html#119390752    So I got there around 8pm on Friday night via Amtrak Moynihan Train Hall met up with my friend who lives in Brooklyn who it turns out was in town after all. Had fun walking around The Village and West Village and surrounding area for a few hours finished it off with the last show at Comedy Cellar's Village Underground which was so fun and awesome. Rich Vos and Eleanor Kerrigan were especially funny the whole show was great the host ruled too (I think his name was Artie?) so many great comics.    And in general I really like the vibe of The Village area I'm from Boston and it's kind of the level of excitement and cool stuff to walk around that is both different and not too outside what I'm used to. Great great pizza at Bleeker Street Pizza too.    My hotel was in Flushing thanks again for that great tip it was a really good deal (and got an additional discount by mentioning a price matching thing). And right next to the 7 train so about 40 minutes to get into the city. Plus Flushing itself was a great area to hang out it had some really fun anime stores that I liked Project KE and Anime Castle were the ones I hit and there are a couple more too. Fun stuff KE has big statues of characters like Monkey D. Luffy and Goku or Hanamichi from Slam Dunk fun for photos. And got some nice food from a street window place.    Later on me and my friend met up again and we met near Bryant Park I was there briefly but it was super super packed like people mentioned it would be. It was even more than I figured since I had been Times Square before it was just wall to wall packed lot of Christmas store boothes and Waffles and stuff. And I got an obligatory peak at Times Quare since I accidentally got off one stop later aiming for Bryant so I got to see some of that wildness. And in this area was fun seeing everybody around with Christmas getups.    So we ended up wandering to less busy areas with the destination being my concert venue the Gramercy Theatre. Got some good burgers looked around at several cool parks on Fri and Sat like Madison Square Park and Washington Square Park. I like all the cool Christmas trees they have up around the city too the one at Madison Square Park is really nice. And Gramercy Theatre is great my kind of intimate rock venue Marky Ramone's Holiday Blitzkrieg is incredible. So cool. Got some pizza next door after good stuff.    Sunday my train was leaving at 6pm and was raining so I grabbed some food early headed down to my friend's place in Brooklyn in the afternoon was nice to see his neighborhood. Also got some good pizza naturally. To get from Flushing to Brooklyn I took an Uber which worked out nicely but on Saturday I used only the trains and a bus so I felt I earned an Uber. It was not too shabby getting used to the NY subway for my first time.    Caught my Amtrak train after riding the subway again from Brooklyn to Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station and long story short it was a wonderful trip even better than I had figured. Thanks again for the tips and info! Would definitely do it again. ,Ian2040,New York City,

Hi I‚Äôm arranging a holiday coming from Ireland with my son as a surprise we both want to go to Washington DC he would love to see Philadelphia too but it‚Äôs not a necessity as he wants to also see as much of NYC also and we only have 6 days. I was thinking 3 days in each or would 2 be enough in Washington and then fly from Washington to nyc. It works out the same price to come from here into Washington then onto nyc but stay in Brooklyn as it does to stay for the whole time in Manhattan. Is this doable or should I really rethink everything? I don‚Äôt have a big budget so I‚Äôm trying to do this as affordable as possible. Any suggestions or advice very much welcome ,LoveaHollierüòÄ,New York City,Ireland

My husband and are planning a 4 day trip to NYC in Jan over MLK weekend (arriving Fri mid-day) and have a few things planned but are open-minded to explore the city. I am from NY/NJ originally (now in Boston) so we have been to NYC many times but not necessarily always getting to be true tourists.    I booked the Archer Hotel in Midtown just south of Bryant Park. I thought Summit One tickets at 4 pm for the 5 pm sunset would be nice for Fri. I was poking around for a nicer/more comfortable spot to see jazz/live music and found Django in downtown that has a show at 7:30 that night. I've never been there though - we'll need to eat there as well I think given timing. Then Sat AM the Met with a tour - I was considering springing for a private 3 hr tour with Context I heard good things about but not sure if thats necessary and if hubs can make it 3 hrs: https://www.contexttravel.com/cities/new-york/tours/met-museum-tour Sunday night we'd go to see Wicked (which I actually have never seen!). We'd head back to LGA late afternoon Mon.    We are serious foodies really enjoy eating out and unique dining experiences so that is definitely part of what we need to figure out still - some options we were thinking about were Kjun Noksu Jazba Noble Kitchen HUSO Koloman. We don't necessarily need to do any of the typical touristy unless there is something you think we have probably missed all these years and should revisit. Any ideas of a unique live performance? Food tour? Unique dining experience? Any reactions to Django or have other jazz/live music suggestions where you aren't packed liked a sardine/has good food too? Is it worth touring around Central Park in winter (obvs much depends on the weather)?    We are open minded enjoy experiences food :-) and learning new things. Thanks in advance for your advice! ,MarenaCeleste,New York City,Boxford...

Does anyone know if summit one allow you to change your ticket to a different day in the case of bad weather/poor visibility?    I‚Äôm aware that no refunds are allowed for tickets but I couldn‚Äôt find on their website whether they‚Äôd allow you to move to another day? I emailed them a few days ago but haven‚Äôt received a response. I‚Äôve booked to go this Sunday and it is forecast to rain. I knew I was taking a gamble when I booked it more than a couple of days out but wanted the sunset time and this would sell out otherwise. ,wanderlust,New York City,"Cotswolds, United..."
Hello Everyone    Travelling to NYC Manhattan Times Sq. RockefellerTree Central Park Empire State Building are the main attractions.

We are a family of five and looking at hotel prices not really affordable for us to stay in Manhattan for a week next December.  Looks more affordable options in Brooklyn and New Jersey however we are not sure which area will be best from a perspective of accessing Manhattan/attractions using public transport while also being close to restaurants/services.  Would like suggestions on which suburbs/localities might work best. ,Aussietraveller,,

Me and my partner are travelling here in October/september 2024 for 5 days. We are very unsure on how much spending money we should take.    We will be doing all the usual paid tourist stuff. Empire state top of the rock summit possibly a show 9/11 museum etc aswell as obviously a lot of free stuff.    We will definitely eat out every meal breakfast lunch and dinner with no doubt a couple nice dinner places. I expect we will have a few drinks/cocktails every night also (Scottish haha). Also probably hit up some fast food places for breakfast maybe even dinner. We don‚Äôt plan on doing much shopping really. Maybe pick up a couple small things but nothing major.    What should we expect to budget to be comfortable and not having to stress about money and constantly checking bank etc.    We were thinking about ¬£2000 to then converted to dollars about $2500. Would this be enough or should we budget more.    Thanks for any help. ,JS18,,"Edinburgh, United..."
What is the best way to go from Brooklyn to Newark Airport assuming you have luggage? I have mostly taken a car service from Brooklyn to JFK Airport and vice versa and that usually is $40 to $50 total. I do recall it cost more from JFK Airport to Brooklyn as oppose to the other way around since the car service is driving to the airport as oppose to picking someone up? So the car service or person who drives is usually a car service I used or someone we know so we pay them instead.      I previously have taken the subway and then the airtrain a while back doing this from Brooklyn even with luggage but I stopped doing that and just go to JFK Airport and back by car now as it's easier. The issue is with the subway it's usually crowded but if you have a seat or space that's fine. Then you have to carry your luggage up the stairs which is a pain. The airtrain however there is no issue with that as there is usually plenty of space.      Now if I wanted to go to Newark Airport how much more is it by car service? I know there is an extra toll you have to pay but how much total including toll and tip? Is it like $80 or it's more than that? Uber seems to show close to $100 but I never used that before. I know going to Newark Airport is a lot more than JFK and Laguardia since it's in another state. Now if you had very little luggage or no luggage you would just take the subway and then the NJ Transit Train and then the airtrain? How much does that cost total? But only do this if you have little luggage or no luggage right?      Does it also depend on where in Brooklyn you are or it's pretty much the same? ,Benny G,New York City,

Any tips for something to do on NYE that doesn't involve a party? Our plans are to avoid all areas near Times Square.

I heard horror stories about tipping in NYC but please to say it is not as bad as people often say.    I didn't eat in any fancy restaurants (NYC is already too expensive) but in any of fast food restaurants nobody asked for tips.    When you pay the merchant usually hands over card machine to you. There are options for No tip 10% 15% 20%. You can select your choice or sometimes you can add custom tip amount.    I didn't pay any tip and nobody asked me why.    In Starbucks (which I used) they set the tip amount to zero before handing the machine over to you.    For taxis I used Uber only where no driver asked me to tips. You get a menu inside app if you want to tip.    I also rode on Amtrak train (to Niagara Falls) and nobody asked for tip there either.    So it is entirely up to you whether you want to tip or not.    The displayed price never includes tax. So actual price paid is always higher than displayed price. I considered this as tipping to Uncle Sam so didn't tip additionally. ,holidzf,New York City,"London, United..."

My boyfriend and I are college students taking a trip to NYC for a weekend in February 2024. I have driven very long distances/across states before so I'm used to highways and stuff but tend to get way too stressed out in city areas such as Pittsburgh and Washington DC. I only imagine NYC would be even more of a nightmare.    I would love to be able to drive most of the distance myself (from Pittsburgh area to New York) and then park my car somewhere (garage lot anything) to take a bus or train the rest of the way into the city. Even if that means taking the bus/train for multiple hours.    If anyone has any knowledge or experience of the best place for me to park please let me know! I've never done this before and as someone younger could use the guidance! Thank you so much!!! ,Eddie G,New York City,
I really need that information thank so much ,Gentha A,,
Hello all!  I'm a college student who has traveled long-distances before but never by train. I'm driving from Pittsburgh to the Hamilton NJ Station and parking there in order to get to NYC without having to do the big-city NYC driving. Does anybody have any experience with the Hamilton station/getting into NYC by this train?  It just makes me a little nervous going into something this new so if anyone who has driven here/rode this specific train before can go into as much detail as possible for me about the process I would be very grateful! I just want to know exactly what to expect. Thanks so much and happy holidays!!!  - Eddie ,Eddie G,New York City,
Hi everyone. We are returning in January for probably our 12th visit to the magical city of New York.

We will be in the city this Saturday  December 9. I know it will be crowded. We have grouped our activities by area. eg. those near Rockefeller Center. Those places are the most important to us.  We also might go to Grand Central Station The Friends experience ( for shopping) If time allows we might try to get a view from land of the Statue of Liberty. Is it better to take the subway or get tickets to a Hop on Hop Off Bus?. ( Big Bus Tours) If this post does not give enough details I apologize.    We will begin our day in the city by 9am. Will stop for lunch and dinner then see the lights around Rockefeller after dinner.    o ,LV2travelmore,,United States

Hi everyone I have just booked a trip from NZ to Europe with American Airlines that leaves next Friday. I am transiting through NYC arriving at La Guardia on Friday at 3pm and leaving from JFK at 7pm. When I spoke to AA over the phone they assured me there is enough time but I still have some concerns.  I have to disembark at LGA collect my bags clear customs to enter the US transfer to JFK recheck my bags and clear customs again. Last time I traveled to the US back in 2016 I remember this being a somewhat lengthy process.  If anyone travels frequently to/from NYC and can advise how long entering the US and getting through JFK normally takes I would feel a lot better.  I first enter the US in Dallas where I have a 2.5 hour stopover. Can I do all the visa stuff and customs clearing there and if so would it save me some time in NYC (sorry if that's a dumb question it's been a while)?  Also is my best bet to Uber between airports (which will be pricey but supposedly only takes 20-25 mins)? The fastest public transport option that appears on Google takes slightly over an hour and involves multiple buses and an air train.  Thanks in advance I really appreciate any advice :) ,Euro_Twink,,"Wellington, New..."

I know that you will be rolling your eyes at me but I still haven‚Äôt booked my SOL time slot for next week‚Ä¶.    I know it‚Äôs risky and one has to roll the dice but I keep checking daily and the availability does fluctuate. Just because it does look like the weather will not be the best next week I am trying really hard to time it right.    If I were to book it early this week TUE looked the best at a time but now looking at the forecast and it seems like TUE is the worst weather says heavy rain at times.    I feel like I do need to book it today though because playing with the fire. The way weather looks now TUE is the worst so my options either MON at 1 PM or WED at 9 am/11 am.    I am willing to do it on MON. I would have Vanderbuilt for the 9am or so and then the SOL in the afternoon‚Ä¶. Seems like the weather would be the best. My question to you how much time one needs once on the island would 1 PM be good? Mind you I know that realistically we are going to get there at 2 or so‚Ä¶.    Or you think it‚Äôs best to just go with WED at 9 or 11 AM and be it. I am sorry that I am inundating you with my indecisiveness. ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada
Hi    We will be in NYC from 31st December to 6th January. It is my partners 50th on 3rd Jan so looking for a nice restaurant. We like most food Thai being one of our favourites but really we are happy with any cuisine.    However as we will be with two teenagers 15 and 17 one of whom is very fussy about what she eats it would be a waste for us to go anywhere with a set menu or fine dining even though that would be perfect for my partner and myself. I like the idea of the River Cafe for the views but the menu just wouldn't be suitable for the kids.    Any suggestions where we could go? somewhere with a great atmosphere great decor Chinese Thai Italian Steak House (as long as theres chicken on the menu too) anything really.    Budget is not an issue and happy to try most cuisines    We are staying close to Times Square but don't mind getting a taxi or Uber.    Thank you ,Simon K,New York City,"Whitefield, United..."

Hi everyone keen to get some input on whether this proposed itinerary sounds ok (Logistically/enough time etc). We arrive into NY late on 1st July (from Australia) so mindful of jetlag etc. 4 adults and a 12 year old in the group. My husband and I haven't been to NY for over 20 years and we are travelling with another couple who have never been to America. Keen to hit the tourist things but welcome any ideas for places to grab lunch or dinner on these days (or if anything obvious I have missed). Keen to explore ourselves rather than a guided tour knowing we have flexibility to make changes as we go. We are all well travelled so happy to go off in different directions and explore too!  Proposed itinerary #1!  Tue 2nd July: American Museum Natural History/Central Park/Dinner-Times Square  Wed 3rd July: Top of the Rock/ Shopping/ Dumbo/ Brooklyn Bridge  Thur 4th July: Yankees Baseball Game/evening fireworks  Fri 5th July: Statue of Liberty/Wall Street/ 9/11 Museum & Memorial/ The Oculus  (Sat 6th: we have 1/2 day to explore before transit to next city)    Appreciate any feedback....changes additions or general tips too :) Cant wait! ,Lyndelle C,New York City,
Going to NYC for (possibly) a once in a lifetime trip with the spouse 18 and 19 year old girls and a 19 year old boy between Christmas and New Years. Would love to hear suggestions of a 4 day itinerary to hit all the must-sees. We aren't museum ppl although we are going to hit the 911 Memorial for sure. Staying near Rockefeller Center. Love hole-in-the-wall restaurants and I promise to any locals I will not pass along any secret spots you'd rather keep on the down-low from tourists. We just love good food! ;). But I'm on information overload and am desperate for help. üôèüèΩ. Thank you!!!!!!!!!! üíö‚ù§Ô∏è ,Dave S,New York City,
Hello TA    I‚Äôm in NY now for the week and I‚Äôm looking to buy a Peacoat or sometimes called a Car Coat or something like a Trench Coat. I of course will hit the department stores like Macy‚Äôs and Nordstroms but if anyone knows a special store just for coats that would be great. ,travelpro69,New York City,"San Jose, California"
I've had the NYC Winter Jazz Fest-- particularly the Fri/Sat marathons -- on my list for a long time and am considering doing it solo (nobody I know seems to have the endurance for this event). Would love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs attended solo. What's the vibe--more listening room or more social? I‚Äôm very comfortable solo in listening room settings. Not so much in more social live events. Appreciate any insight!  https://www.winterjazzfest.com ,Janette S,New York City,"Middlesex, vt"
Attending Cirque du Soleil at Theater @MSG Friday night... we will likely be ice skating at Bryant Park that afternoon and would be carrying bags with the kids' skates. (I know its easier to just rent but kids want to bring their own and husband wants to save the $).    I know MSG doesn't have bag check but allows bags if they fit under the seat... but I assume with the blades and all security might say no?    We'll be traveling by PATH so if there's an easy place near there to leave a bag for a few hours I'd love recommendations. ,Bethany R,New York City,TX

Hi    We will be in NYC from 31st December to 6th January. It is my partners 50th on 3rd Jan so looking for a nice restaurant. We like most food Thai being one of our favourites but really we are happy with any cuisine.    However as we will be with two teenagers 15 and 17 one of whom is very fussy about what she eats it would be a waste for us to go anywhere with a set menu or fine dining even though that would be perfect for my partner and myself. I like the idea of the River Cafe for the views but the menu just wouldn't be suitable for the kids.    Any suggestions where we could go? somewhere with a great atmosphere great decor Chinese Thai Italian Steak House (as long as theres chicken on the menu too) anything really.    We are staying close to Times Square but dont mind getting a taxi or Uber.    Thank you ,Simon K,,"Whitefield, United..."

I'm delighted to see that the Morgan is once again offering afternoon tea in its airy sunlit Cafe a glass-enclosed atrium:  https://www.themorgan.org/visit/dining  https://bethanylooi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_7195-640x800.jpg  Granted you won't be given fine bone china plates cups and saucers or loose leaf tea rather you choose from various Harney & Sons tea sachets which you'll steep in your own individual tea pot. But the price is just $54 for 2 people; you can also order Champagne other wines or spirits; the pre-pandemic scones & clotted cream were especially tasty & Im hopeful that will be true now; and it's a relaxing place to be.  https://host.themorgan.org/drupal/dining/MorganCafeMenu.pdf    You don't need to pay an admission fee to access the cafe or the terrific gift shop  https://www.themorgan.org/shop  but you might very well decide you'd like to see the stunning Library and one or more of the many exhibitions.

We‚Äôre a family of 5 (youngest is 16) planning 5 days in Manhattan and thinking of adding 2 extra days for trip in a hire car. I know we could spend longer in NYC but it‚Äôs the 1st time to USA for most of us and we‚Äôd like to experience another side to the country. Ideally a typical/small town somewhere that would feel worth the trip bit of history/culture to potter about small shops short walks kayak in scenic area or maybe a boat trip.  Tons of research has left me indecisive! Long Island -Greenport Sag H Montauk (but tight budget will mean a chain hotel as a base eg Riverhead or maybe an Airbnb -if it‚Äôs legal in LI?). Hudson Valley eg Beacon Tarrytown Cold Spring. Would coastal CT or RI be worth a longer drive (Mystic Newport or where else?). Are these choices good? And which would you recommend? I'd love suggestions from people who know the area. Thank you! ,MaNi,New York City,

We are looking at going to New York for mine and my husbands 30th birthdays in April. He has never been but I have been twice before when I was 15 and 18. When I have been before we stayed in the Roosevelt hotel and the location was very convenient. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt remember where exactly it was.    Does anyone have any suggestions of which area is best to stay in and any hotel recommendations?? We want to walk to most places where we can and do all the usual touristy things. We will use the hop on hop off bus for a few days of our trip when we want to go further afield. We are thinking of staying for 5 days.    To give an idea of budget- When I have looked at hotels it seems hotels such as The New Yorker and RIU Plaza Times Square are in our budget. ,BethanH999,New York City,Wales

Feeling a bit silly as I gave my other holiday thread a poor title and now of course I can‚Äôt correct it. (Said ‚ÄúDecember‚Äù but many things are already up and running already and it‚Äôs only mid-November!) So I‚Äôm just going to regroup and carry on here instead and shut down the other thread.    ***    We haven‚Äôt started a thread for 2023 Christmas yet and I notice we are dropping lots of good nuggets in different threads that people may not see.

I have been to New York once in mid-December and twice for Thanksgiving so I have done some of the activities I will list but not nearly all of them.    Not everybody celebrates Christmas of course but there is just a ton of just pure winter enjoyment going on and lots of fun to be had by all.

Hi  I'd like to spend 3 days in NYC (12/11-12/14 to be specific). Hotels now in Manhattan is really like doubling than cost before the covid. The last time I visited NYC back in 2019 and it was affordable under $200/nigh considering time near Christmas. So I have to look eslewhere and found Sheranton Brooklyn New York hotel (not too far from Dumbo) fits my bill. The only concern is how to commute back and forth between Brooklyn and Manhattan daily.    I'll be driving from Washington DC and park at Staten Island ferry parking garage (I guess it is now garage at Empire Oultets and the last time I heard cost is $20 max per day which is affordable.

Hi in two weeks I'm taking Amtrak from Boston to Moynihan Train Hall in NYC. My lodging is in Jersey City but I'm mainly spending time in the city. Had some questions both about places to go and some logistics. And any tips for first timers.    From my research so far looks like I'll be checking out the Midtown areas like Bryant Park but I'm open to suggestions too. The main thing is I'm seeing a show at Gramercy Theatre Saturday night. On Friday I'll have a few hours at night and Sunday maybe a couple in the afternoon before catching my train back home.    Since I'm staying in Jersey City looks like I'll need a Lyft or Uber to get into the city or use thePATH train and bus etc which takes about an hour. And I've heard some drivers are reluctant to take fares from Jersey City into NYC since they can't pick up fares in NYC etc so just wondering about if there's anything I need to know on that.    My other thought is on Fri and Sun for those few hours I could explore I may do it with backpack on. That way I could just pack my clothes etc in there and not need to make an extra trip to Jersey City on those days for luggage. On Saturday I'm seeing that show around 7 or 8pm but I'm a night owl so I would walk around a couple hours after if that's doable and places are open. And I'd have the day before that say 1pm-7pm to do my most wandering and exploring.    So I don't have a ton of time mainly came for the show but I'd like to soak in some NYC and maybe see some cool places to walk. And interest wise I'd like to see those Japanese book stores in Midtown maybe the Midtown Comics in Grand Central if I have time.    But since it's between where I'm coming and where I'm going (Gramercy Theatre) I'm thinking Bryant Park may be where I hang out. Could take an Uber or something to another nearby neighborhood for a couple hours on one of these days too though.    So that's my thoughts so far any ideas or advice? Thanks. ,Ian2040,New York City,
We are staying at Luma Hotel Times Square and on our first day we would like to take the subway to Brooklyn Bridge on the DUMBO side and then walk across the bridge back towards manhattan.    We are from the UK so unfamiliar with the New York subway and would appreciate any help on which stations to use and which lines?    I assume there are maps at the stations to help us and understand we can tap In and out with our credit cards like on the London Underground.    I think our nearest station is either Bryant Park or Times Square and from the map it looks as if the nearest station to DUMBO is High St or York St?    Any advice is much appreciated! ,Dinah_family,New York City,"London, United..."
Well we are back from our Thanksgiving NYC adventure. We hit lots of bucket list items this week. While we are happy to say we did them and enjoyed them most are a 1 and done for us. Still we loved being in the city (we have visited many time in the spring and summer). We are a family of 4 with 3rd and 5th grade boys.    We stayed at the brand new Aloft Chelsea on 28th (I called a few days before just to make sure it actually opened). It was adequately New York sized and by far the cleanest room we could hope for. The elevator had a learning curve (you program it before getting on) but otherwise as expected hotel.    Day 1: Flight into Newark and subsequent Uber (we used both uber and lyft whichever was less) was uneventful. The kids were very hungry and requested pizza for dinner. It was lightly raining but not enough to bother us. We ended up at Artichoke Pizza which was fabulous. We continued on to Radio City to see the Rockettes! Great start to our holiday week. I ended up finding discounted obstructed view seats (4 for $250) which was fine for us. The boys enjoyed it and glad we did it but not something we would make a habit of going to on a return trip.    Day 2: Slow morning start but got going and walked to Black Iron burgers for lunch which was good. My parents were with us today and it should be noted that my Mom was using a wheelchair do to a broken foot and being in a boot. I know they were able to rent the wheelchair that was delivered to their hotel. It was a lifesaver for her being able to enjoy the trip which was planned before the broken foot. We used lots of uber XLs as it was the easiest way for her to get around. I don't want to even look at what we spent on car services this week as we would have typically walked or used the subway much more.    Anyway we were off to see the balloon inflation! We arrived about 1:30 and it took us 1.5 hours in line to reach security. We enjoyed about half of the balloons as it was time to move on to our next activity. Apparently this is getting very popular and I definitely underestimated the time needed to do this.    We had 415 reservations for the Holiday Train Show at the NYBG. This was lovely. Wednesday evening crowd was manageable and very well done.    We finished the night at Antonio's on Arthur Avenue which was arguably our best meal of the trip. We picked up some pastries at a bakery to eat at the hotel.    Day 3: Thanksgiving Day. There are many things we'd do differently and it worked out ok but the parade was rough for us.    We crossed over and walked up 5th to the parade. There are no open street access to 6th until you get to 44th. We probably should have gone up higher or crossed 6th but it is what it is. We did also have my Mom and the wheelchair which limited our mobility to find a different spot. We got to 44th probably around 740ish. It was a pedestrian crossing street which limited the amount of viewing as well as the southeast corner was closed do to a camera. My goal had been to get to Bryant Park. You could not get to street level by the time we got there and there was LOTS of pushing. The amount of people with luggage trying to get to their flight amazed me. My little one was able to get me and him a little closer and then also realized most were trying to stay up on the sidewalk so we were able to stand on the street for a little more elbow room. First floats began around 915ish. The 2 of us ended up seeing the most and I do have some great pictures. As people left we were able to scoot up and did finally reach street level were I could see north. I picked him up when a float was close. My mom saw almost nothing and luckily my brother was able to get her out ok. We did see other wheelchairs and stroller about. By about 1030ish the kids were done and we began to make our way out of the crowd. I was amazed at how many more people were down 44th behind us.    As we were crossing 6th by our hotel we could see the Pikachu float approaching Macy's. We took a few photos and then went up to the hotel room to see Pikachu on TV and watch the finally from the comfort of our room.    We finished our day by heading over to Jackson Heights for a wonderful mid afternoon dinner with family.    Day 4: Can't be in NYC to kick off the holiday season without seeing THE big guy at Santaland. I was able to secure a 9am reservation (a reservation to stand in a 30-90min line per Macys) which was the 3rd reservation slot of the day. This was our last day so it had to be this day but wholly black friday. I've done some black friday shopping back when it was a bigger thing but it's been a long time if I've ever seen crowds like this! We ended up waiting about 2 hours to see Santa (the kids did great). The line had to be at least 3 hours long when we exited. We did get a good picture and the kids seemed to enjoy the experience but I would never pick that day to do this again.    We headed to Bryant Park where we had 1250 ice skating reservations. We picked up some food from the market first. This area was also very crowded. The little one decided he didn't want to skate so I skated with the 5th grader who said this was his favorite thing. Topped this off with some hot chocolate from the market and pictures in front of the tree.    Told the kids they could shop at their stores so we headed up to Rockefeller where we encountered more lines. FAO Schwartz was up first where it really is quite impressive with all the demonstrations. The kids picked Nintendo next (over Lego) where they had fun trying out the games that are on their Christmas lists. At this point the 8 yr old was done so DH took hum back to the hotel. And 5th grader and I attempted to go into 1 or 2 more stores but the crowds were overwhelming. I wanted to see the storefront of SAKs and did hit it when they started the light show. This was awesome the whole street froze to watch it. I wish I had legs left to keep walking north to the other stores but glad I got to see at least this one (and Macys). We then headed back to the hotel where we grabbed a bite to eat near the hotel.    Flying back on a Saturday morning was super easy with no traffic or delays!    Overall we all had a good time and can't wait for our next visit in warmer weather! ,BANT17,New York City,"Tampa, Florida"
Booking a flight for my daughter as she is doing camp America starting in June  Have found a flight from Manchester to JFK that connects in Dublin which is perfect as other camp staff are flying from there.  Had a question on the Pre Clearance and how the connection works in general    As she is flying from Manchester to Dublin will she still be able to do pre clearance of USA customs at Dublin?  Also has anyone done this route before as she isnt 18 until a few days before she goes and hasnt flown on her own before let alone done a connecting flight so trying to get as much info on what she needs to do and where she needs to go in advance if possible    Many Thanks ,Chris H,New York City,Rhyl
Hi! Where do I look to book a hotel in NYC where I walk out the door and am in a little downtown-ish area with cafes/restaurants and shopping etc? Not bars just food and shopping (and ideally close to subway). 2nd NYC trip - first stay was at the Thompson Central Park. Must have: king bed traveling with my 2 teens girls. THANK YOU!! Booking today!!    Looking near:    -Bryant Park (close to holiday market and the 5th ave stuff but seems not what I'm looking for) - The Refinery or Grayson?    -NoMad/Flatiron- ish - Made or Virgin or Hyatt Union Square?    -Chelsea (not near pier more near chelsea market - more local feel? safe??) - The High Line? (not the Standard) The Maritime looks interesting but no King beds. Chelsea is interesting though so big I'm nervous to land in a not great area.    -Soho - Modern Haus or SoHo Grand?    -Greenwich/West Village - Walker and Marlton are out (no King beds) - Washington Square hotel has no availability sadly    -East Village Moxy? ,Lesli T,New York City,

Here it is the Highly anticipated the Macys 2023 Thanksgiving day trip report    This year the parade started 30 mins earlier for some reason but it was still 2 hours long.I do not know why    I left my house at about 7am and got to the Parade route spot at about 7:45. I bought along a beach chair with me so I could sit before the parade . You will be able to see from my pictures how close I got The parade got to my spot at about 9am. I was about 5 people back but because I had my chair I ha more space than normal (People dont care about the chair as it doesnt block their view)    I did have to stand the only way you could sit the whole parade is arrive at about 5am which wasnt happening    The Parade ended at 11am at my spot in the 50's. You can see from the photos I had a clear view north Thats the most important thing    I did have to use the facilities but I was able to wait until after the parade I wasnt too far from Trump Tower so why not give a Donation    Here are the Photos    https://imgur.com/gallery/FCJYfzL ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City
Hi i have posted a few times before and really appreciated all the help given. My husband and I have visited before but it was in 2006 so a lot has changed since then. We are keen shoppers and happy to pack as much in as possible. Dont mind walking around and will likely use the Subway most of the time. We are in New York for 5 days staying at Hilton MIdtown and we were thinking of this Itinerary  Day 1 -  9/11 Museum and One World Observatory. Lunch then Statue of Liberty. Central Park Strawberry fields and Bloomingdales (if time).  Day 2 -  Chinatown and Little Italy (mill around) 5th Avenue Rockefella tree and toy shop dinner and a show  Day 3 -  Woodbury Common (i know this is not everyone's choice but something we feel we would enjoy)  Day 4 -  RIse NY Grand Central Station One Vanderbilt (night) Ellen's Stardust diner (might do the bus tour this day)  Day 5 -  THE friends experience (we are big fans of the show)chelsea market head to JFK for around 5pm.  Any suggestions of things to miss or must do that we haven't thought of would be appreciated. We know it will be very cold so have left out walking on Highline and bridge etc. ,Harry S,New York City,"Glasgow, United..."
Hi looking for advice on where to stay on a budget 1 week in NYC for my wife and I (two women) requiring double / queen bed and private ensuite. Manhattan is expensive should we stay elsewhere? Also any advice regarding traveling from Melbourne Australia? Thank you. ,Lindsay N,New York City,
The best and least expensive way to get from Penn Station to JFK Airport is to take the express E train heading uptown to Jamaica Center. Get off at the Sutphin Blvd Archer Ave stop (2nd to last stop). Walk up to 2nd level and look for the signs to Air Train. Take the elevator to the air train level. If you take the escalator instead you will need to walk a short distance to get into the air train station. Cost of the E train ticket is $2.75 and the Air Train ticket is $8 which can be added to your Metro card.    Alternatively you can use the LIRR train from Penn Station that will take you to the Air Train station. You will need to purchase a separate ticket for the LIRR train (cannot use the Metro card). Cost is $7.25 one way; Air train ticket can be purchased at machines for $8 or use your Metro Card.    I find that using the E train is easiest and less expensive. ,islandgirl2244,New York City,virginia

Hi all. I am visiting New York for New years with my 12 year old daughter. Is there anywhere you can book to get a good view of the ball drop and the fireworks without having to be in the thick of the crowds in Times Square. A lot of places seem to be charging a fortune to guarantee good views.

One near Bryant Park?  We are switching up our upcoming hotel reservation to be 2 rooms vs 1 suite for our family. Since I am already making changes I am wondering about switching to a different location all together. I am not going to one of the shows and might take myself to Summit instead.  I like the convenience of Bryant Park for the 2 shows we are seeing (they are a 10 minute or 14 minute walk from the Archer). I might not do the Archer but that is one of the options.  But I was interested in trying a different area of Manhattan and Broadway Plaza looks like a good option. We always enjoy Eataly Shake Shack and the Harry Potter Store.  Prices for our weekend are all in a comfortable range for my budget so it really isn't a consideration.  I've spent a lot of time debating choices and would be happy for folks to toss a coin and chime in too.  Thanks! ,wren341,New York City,
Finally it looks as though we have our accommodation sorted so now I am on the lookout for some great places to eat. I like to have things booked up so we aren't wandering aimlessly and wasting time but if something that comes up that catches our eye we can always cancel.  Our first trip to NYC we were young and broke last trip we had very young children at Christmas time so this time with our Teens it will be a whole different holiday. We want to make sure we get out somewhere different every night so hoping for 1 night Meatpacking district Hells Kitchen Midtown Chelsea and East Village. We are hoping to have one top notch dinner without the kids and other nights would love an Asian Fusion Italian and some sort of Tex Mex (to make our kids happy). They would probably love a good burger night as well. We are in NYC for a week. Obviously the nights out with the kids we don't want anything ultra expensive but we do like a good night out so want areas where there are a few places we could stop for one drink as well.  If anyone can throw out any suggestions were you had a wonderful meal it would be much appreciated. There are so many lists of best restaurants and its hard to narrow them down. Dinners out are probably the favourite part of any holiday.  Thannks in advance. :) ,Night,New York City,

Me again‚Ä¶. Trying to organize myself and my family for the parade. We are not one of those that will be standing for hours waiting for the parade so 6 AM arrival will not be in the picture‚Ä¶ My husband would be able to alternative kids on his shoulders to sit in hopes to see something. I understand that there will be ton of ppl but I can imagine given that floats are ginormous we should be able to see something‚Ä¶.. Planning maybe 8 AM arrival to any viewing point that is recommended. I searched websites including mommy poppins and collected the advices below. Some contradicts to each other‚Ä¶. Can you help me reading the below where exactly I need to go to stand that way I can map out the public transportation etc. if all are good maybe give me priorities 1 2 3 where to stand so I can have options‚Ä¶.    PARADE  Consider standing along Central Park West a few blocks south (below) of the line-up on the west side of the avenue.  Consider the west side of Central Park West in the 60s or 70s. The east side of Central Park West is not open for viewing. However if you enter Central Park north of 86th Street and meander south you can catch a peek from a hill or playground.  6th Avenue. Great views from West 59th to West 38th Streets!  The best place to see the parade is between 42nd and 57th St on 6th Ave as long as you have an unobstructed view looking North.  It's best to avoid Sixth Avenue between 34th and 38th streets and the grandstand area (usually near Columbus Circle); both are closed to the public.  Stay away from the Times Square area and the area around Macy‚Äôs. It will get VERY crowded in those locations ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada

TL;DR: NY Waterway is a great option for anyone who hates trains / being underground and very reliable on parade day. Merrion Row is an A+ lodging option close to all the midtown highlights plus a stone's throw from the parade route. From this experience we also learned that the Fairfield Central Park has low floor / lobby level rooms.  ---  Hello all! Many of you were very helpful several weeks ago when I was trying to figure out the logistics of my mom and I pulling off a parade trip. We live about 90 mins outside NYC in South Jersey but my mom has a lot of anxiety about trains and won't use elevators which always causes a lot of complications when trying to get her into the city and finding a place to stay. I thought I would post an update as I've often benefitted from my spouse/parent/child etc. doesn't use xyz posts from others over the years and hope to return the favor.    At the advice of many people in this forum we ditched the original plan of taking the car (which was causing a lot of complications with lodging options + road closures). I kept trying to figure out public transit options but the only thing she was willing to compromise on was a hypothetical boat - which is how I learned about NY Waterway (literally never knew this existed - she loved it and is already envisioning the future possibilities). We left our house at 5:15am parade morning parked right across the street from the station at Port Imperial got our tickets walked right onto the 7:00am boat and were in the city by 7:10 - then got onto a waiting shuttle that whisked us to Times Square for free (which significantly cut the walk from the ferry the part of the trip I was dreading). Overall this was a huge win that ultimately made this trip possible!    Our winning lodging option was a property I didn't even know existed until 5 days before the parade - the Merrion Row Hotel & Public House on 45th between 5th/6th. We originally settled on the Fairfield near Central Park which informed us they had rooms on lobby level. Our plan was to stay at the Fairfield and walk to Columbus Circle for the parade not realizing until the weekend before there wasn't really a public viewing option there (I read some stuff about the indoor viewing at TWC but didn't want to risk only relying on that in the event it wasn't an option this year). Once CC derailed (and we mutually decided we were too lazy to hike it up to the 60s-70s for viewing) I started searching third party sites to find a centrally-located winner and stumbled across Merrion Row an old renovated hostel (100 year old building) built on Irish hospitality that has just six floors and a focal staircase that was easy to access - not locked no need to be escorted by staff all the usual issues that give my mom stress. I was surprised to see how high this hotel is rated (30something on TA + Best of the Best) - can't believe a place like this exists half a block from the heart of Times Square in the day and age of the glass high rise (but I'm certainly glad it does!)    As far as parade viewing we decided we only cared about balloons and gave up on the thought of getting close. We dropped our bag at the hotel walked less than 2 minutes to the crowd along 6th Ave at ~7:30am and tried to find the best spot. We made friends with the NYPD officer in our area and ended up getting very very lucky - my mom got a spot right along the barricade at the emergency exit they were keeping clear up until parade time. We ended up having an unobstructed view the whole parade (saw every float band you name it) and were surrounded by really fun good energy people (minus one nutty older couple that shoved any child that got in their way). We all hit it off respected boundaries and took pictures for each other when favorite balloons came by!    Overall felt like we hit the jackpot with transport lodging and viewing spot. We both loved the first 60-80 mins of the parade but felt like the later parts dragged on too long (at one point we had Brandy stuck in front of us for 10 mins haha). Our overall feedback is we would do the parade again but probably not make it a regular thing (I said once every ~5 years). The real victory was having my mom feel comfortable in the city and expanding her horizons! ,mbg996,New York City,Philadelphia...

Wife and I just got back from New York for three nights. I wanted to share some observations of mine from a bona fide tourist for other folks making the trip. This is my third trip to New York and probably close to a dozen for my wife so we did not do the bigger tourist attractions that we have done on previous trips. We had no itinerary our plan was just to wander around and exist in the city for a few days. Below are a few observations I had.  1- There was not as much litter as I remember from my last visit in April 2022. There was litter around but overall the city was cleaner. Also the weed smell that was so pervasive in April 2022 seemed to be better this time. I still smelled a ton of it but not constantly.  2- The homeless were not as visible. I feel certain the homeless population has not decreased so I am not sure what is going on but I didn‚Äôt see nearly as much as prior visits.  3- I felt safe 100% of the time. On the subway walking the East Village after midnight no matter where we were not once did I feel like I was approaching a bad situation or getting a bad vibe from people.  4- Washington Square Park is such a vibe of its own. I love it. I played chess with some guys watched a weird interpretative dance watched some skateboarders trying to get better and a very strange LGBT demonstration against gun violence. Besides the chess everything was viewed from one seat near the Arc. I could sit in that park and people watch all day long.  5- The self-proclaimed Cannoli king in Little Italy truly has amazing cannoli. My wife wanted to buy a dozen to bring home to Thanksgiving. If we could have gotten them home we would have.  6- NY pizza is the best on earth.  7- There is a taco place on 33rd St in the Empire State Building called Tacombe (I think) with amazing tacos. Probably the best I‚Äôve had. Lovers of Mexican food should consider a visit.  8- Rode the subway several times and they always felt safe clean and efficient. They were full of people who were all silently going about their day. Police were present in every station I was in. I never saw a homeless person or anyone who didn‚Äôt appear to be a productive member of society anywhere in the stations. I don‚Äôt share this because I was surprised by it. I simply share it to hopefully ease the minds of future travelers who I know worry about it.  9- I know this isn‚Äôt news by everything is so expensive. Food shopping cab rides. Spend spend spend!  10- I always admire the people who live there because it is so different from my life experience which is why I love visiting. I love this city and wish I could afford to visit more often than I do but I will never trade my mountains and hollows for the city. New Yorkers thank you for offering such a wonderful place for me to visit! ,Brian L,New York City,"Charleston, West..."

We will be staying in Manhattan Dec 17-21. Originally booked to stay in Chelsea area but found out rooms were super small less than 200Sq ft. I changed to a hotel near 28th St/Park Ave( room size 350 sq ft) First time trip for our family of 4. It looks like we will be very close to the 28th St station and can take the 6 train to most places to get around.    It will give us 3 full days. Since we are staying central I was thinking we can catch the 6 train uptown and spend the day in Central Park One day take the 6 train downtown and see Wall Street SOL and 9/11 museum and one day see the things in-between Empire  TS Bryant Park Rockefeller etc.    Never having used a subway system I like I can stay on one train without changing.    We will be seeing a broadway play and it looks like I will have to change trains once but hopefully I will figure that out.    I downloaded CityMapper and Seated app to help with our trip.

I've come across a Cyber Sale announced by the Sonesta group (used to be Affinia) for their three hotels in NYC. The sale goes through April 2024 and looks like the rates are refundable but you must stay at least 2 nights.    Cheapest dates are January and February as usual but over the Thanksgiving week / few days it's not too bad either.    https://www.affinia.com/special-offers/affinia-cyber-sale    Any other good offers at other hotels are welcome to be posted in this thread as well. ,Aynat62,New York City,Greater Sydney...

The Black Friday deals have been good for us Aussies with a terrible dollar trying to snag a bargain. I have been able to get almost identical great rates for 2 rooms at both Renaissance Times Square and Margarittaville.  I know this Times Square is not quite for everyone (and I said never again after last time lol) but this is a trip for our teens who desperatley want to be around Times Square and we will be back in NY again Im sure doing it our way... Anyways if you had to have the choice what do you think is a better hotel? Im leaning towards Margarittaville as on the edge of TS and a newer property  but we are Marriot Gold Elite and it gets the $30 per room credit a day. The rooms slightly larger at the Marriot but that is not a deal breaker as we will be out a lot.. Can anyone give me advice if they have been to one or the other or know the area well? Thanks ,Night,New York City,

As a family of 4 including 2 seniors (around 60) we are planning on spending New Year's Eve in New York for the first time in our lives. We booked an hotel close to Grand Terminal Central. Even though Times Square is the most popular option we can't really spend hours standing in the cold and don't want to be stressed about the frozen zone. So we checked the gala dinners at BallDrop.com around Times Square however the prices are rather high than we are willing to pay. We thought about having a nice dinner at one rooftop restaurants to see the fireworks at midnight but the ones I've checked are more like parties for younger people. Another option is watching the fireworks and the NYC skyline from a NYE dinner cruise but I've also read different comments on that.  Has anyone done either of these before?  Do you have any recommendations for restaurants that host a NYE gala dinner for all ages?  Do you have any idea how would be the trip back to our hotel from the pier after midnight? ,A.A,New York City,"Beirut, Lebanon"

Hello we are planning a summer trip for 2024 and i have a few questions.    We plan to drive because when coming back home we plan to shop in Target & Trader Joe's (shops that are not available in Halifax) and have a haul. So my 1st question is... when passing on a toll hiway in the US do they accept credit cards? Google pay? Or must payments be in cash?    2nd: we plan to leave our car for 1 week in our accommodation and commute to Manhattan where would be a great area to stay where there might be private parking (a hotel or airbnb) and access to public transportation? There are only 2 people in this trip. Our main destination is Queens Citi Field as we're watching a concert. Are there hotels or airbnb in the area with free parking? Also i dont want street parking. Would that even be possible? ,The Dabawenya,New York City,"Halifax, Canada"

Hey Folks    5 of us landing in NYC and below are the dates and looking for suggestions on travel plans places to visit cheapest and best option to travel such as plane train hire car or bus.    12th March 2024 (Leave NYC)  25th March 2024 (Must be back at EWR Airport by 3pm)    We are flexible with the options either way as below:    NYC-Buffalo-Washington DC-NYC  NYC-Washington DC-Buffalo-NYC    Thank you so much for your help.

Looking for some help with my NYC itinerary please - would be good to know if what I‚Äôve planned is realistic and any changes or recommendations you‚Äôd make. Food suggestions are always welcome too - I‚Äôd like to make a list of food places for each area we visit. For breakfast we like pancakes oats omelettes egg variations eg. Eggs Benedict French toast. For lunch/dinner we prefer to grab and go or somewhere laid back (not overly fancy) - a bagel pizza slice burger and fries etc. might do a proper sit down dinner one evening. Also want to try some bakeries for cookies croissants etc.    My husband and I are visiting from 2nd-7th december and staying at the Riu plaza New York Times Square hotel. We‚Äôd like to see as many of the main sights as we can but also we don‚Äôt want to exhaust ourselves racing from landmark to landmark all day long. We love just wandering around at our own pace and seeing what we come across and we love street food/food market halls. We are aware that Times Square will be crazily busy and we are ready to embrace that but would also like to wander around some slightly quieter areas. We chose to stay in Times Square as we want to be able to walk to most things. We aren‚Äôt massively interested in the museums other than 9/11 we don‚Äôt want to see any shows and I‚Äôd like to see the Statue of Liberty but think I‚Äôd rather do a cruise that goes near it rather than set foot on the island. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got so far:      Saturday 2nd December    Our flight lands into JFK at 5.20pm. Get a taxi from here to our hotel grab an easy dinner nearby and maybe walk to see Times Square at night if not too tired    Sunday 3rd December    breakfast at the hotel  Summit one in the morning (hoping it will be quieter?)  Look in grand central station as I see it‚Äôs by the summit  Central Park in the afternoon - hire bikes and cycle round  Lunch nearby and try Levain bakery  Evening - walk around Bryant Christmas market    Monday 4th  Breakfast somewhere (I want to try some other breakfast places outside of the hotel)  Get the subway to world trade center  9/11 memorial and museum  Lunch nearby    Evening - 5th av lights saks light show  Ice skating at Rockefeller  Top of the rock in the evening    Tuesday 5th  Breakfast somewhere  Subway to Brooklyn  Walk over Brooklyn bridge  Explore Brooklyn biggie mural  Dumbo  Brooklyn bridge park  Timeout market    Evening - ?    Wednesday 6th    SOL cruise? The main ones I‚Äôve looked at are circle line cruises and classic harbor line. Classic harbor line seems to have the best reviews. Can anyone recommend?    Dyker heights bus tour in the evening (any recommendations for which tour?)    Thursday    Last day - flight home is at 6.55pm from JFK. I think we‚Äôll just wander round and not venture too far. Maybe look at the public library st patricks cathedral    Should I pre-book a taxi from our hotel back to JFK? I know taxis will be waiting outside the airport on arrival but what about getting a taxi for our return journey?    I‚Äôm also aware that my plans involve going back downtown day after day (to Brooklyn to 9/11 museum potentially to SOL tour). Will this be an issue? I thought it might be better to group these things together but it seems a lot to fit in one day? I‚Äôm not confident at all about getting the subway even after looking up the route on Citymapper I still don‚Äôt really understand it but hopefully someone can help me when we‚Äôre there (maybe hotel staff).    Thank you in advance for any help. ,wanderlust,New York City,"Cotswolds, United..."

I have a Video trip report of the Northern part of Central Park in Late Fall    While the trees are past peak you can still see a good number of colors    this is a guided video tour of the Northern Section of Central Park and it winds up at Columbus Circle    You can see in this video The Duke Ellington Monument The Frederick Douglass Statue The Blockhouse which is the oldest building in the Park and dates from the War of 1812 (It predates the Park)  The Waterfall The Harlem Meer and more. Parts of the park most tourists and even locals dont get to see. The video is a bit long as I ended up at 59th St and 8th Ave Columbus circle (The park is 2.5 long) and in the end I walked to times square. I did walk a total of 21000 steps. The waterfall is a bit tricky to find as you sort of have to know where it is to find it    Here is the video There are still plenty of fall colors to see    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHwrcLkOsZA&ab_channel=Travelbuff ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City

Note: Please do not comment that Times Square on NYE is not worth it; that is not helpful.    I am looking for NYE events/ parties around Times Square that would allow me to see the ball drop at midnight. I am willing to pay a little more to experience the drop in person without having to stand for hours in the cold.    I found an event at The Rabbit Hole that promises an escort to the ball drop but the venue doesn't have a website and I'm afraid it may be a scam. Can anyone vouch for this location or confirm that it is a scam?    https://www.eventbrite.com/e/new-years-eve-2024-party-overlooking-times-square-ball-drop-vip-escort-tickets-752082778837?aff=ebdssbdestsearch    Also how does access to hotels in the freeze area work? Can I have friends come to my room before 7 and then have them join me on the street to see the ball drop at midnight? Or are Street access/ passes from hotels limited to the number of people listed on the reservation?    Thank you in advance for all of your insight and help!

Hi    We are visiting NYC from the 22nd - 28th December. I imagine this is going to be a busy time over the festive period. I am making bookings at some places for dinner but was wondering - is it necessary to reserve for drinks if say we want to go somewhere for a couple of pre or post dinner cocktails? Many places which look really nice when you go to reserve online - it mentions you are booking for dinner. I obviously don't want to reserve a table if there is an expectation and perhaps even obligation to then order food when we arrive. ,fizz-mc,New York City,United Kingdom
Am thinking of having a special 10th anniversary holiday next year at end of June in NYC. We‚Äôre in London and I haven‚Äôt been to New York in 25 years. New York hotels are pricey! We like well-designed hotels. I found a pretty good cancellable deal for the arlo soho for $1600 for 8 nights. The reviews are quite mixed tho which makes me worried. I know the rooms are v small but we‚Äôve stayed in CitizenMs before and loved it. But I‚Äôve also been reading about Made hotel which looks great and has much better reviews. However it‚Äôs going to cost $500 more (or $300 but means paying now which I‚Äôm loath to do). If anyone knows both hotels what‚Äôs your thoughts. Is it worth the extra money? It‚Äôs going to be an expensive trip anyway. Also I think I quite like the location of arlo since the made looks like it‚Äôs more in the touristy areas rather than more localised interesting areas. Is that right? Thoughts much appreciated. ,JrichardF,New York City,

Looking to go for four nights over spring break and most of these hotels range from $2000 up to $2500 total. They all seem to have pros and cons and I know it is personal preference but anyone want to weigh in on this decision?    Kimberly - has great ratings but looks a bit dated    Lotte - looks nice but is the most expensive on this list    Luma - like that it has 2 king beds but looks small    Hyatt Centric TS - more updated    We have two teenage daughters so time in the bathroom adds up so having some extra space in the room would be nice to sit down and get ready.    I was kind of hoping to be in walking distance or in a good location central to all of the things but hopefully not in the very middle of Times Square. I‚Äôm assuming we should bring ear plugs in all hotels can be noisy at night when sleeping.

CockleCove started a great thread last year about Thanksgiving dinners under $100 and I thought it was an excellent idea and a great resource. We thought I could kick it off this year so here goes.    A lot of us are battling horrid exchange rates and I find flight fares expensive too for all but the most basic economy flights. Restaurant prices are higher now too into the yikes! üí∞ üò¢category for some it seems. And of course the hotel deals aren‚Äôt what they have been in the past.

We're looking for some recommendations for some chilled bars preferably with sofas to just rock up and relax of an evening. Somewhere we can just chill and talk ab out our days?    Any recommendations? A lot fo bars recommended seem to relate to best cocktails or themes etc etc - we're looking for chilled :) ,Wiggz,New York City,Warwickshire
Hi further to my Qs yesterday just had a thought if we‚Äôre arriving into Manhattan at 2.00 - 2.30pm on NYE is it likely we‚Äôll be able to exit at 42nd St/Port Auth or will it already be in a closed off area?    If that‚Äôs the case does anyone have any advice about alternative mass transit options from JFK to Yotel at West 42nd / 10th Ave?      Thanks as always x ,vickilewis626,New York City,"Scarborough, United..."
Kelli OHara gave a performance at a chamber music festival near here. I just got a discount code for the revival of Days of Wine & Roses with Brian D'Arcy James in case it would be of interest. The code is OHARAFAN. ,blumebwaybaby,New York City,"Syracuse, New York"
We will be BACK in the Big Apple in April and then going to Boston. Prices all in (baggage Airtrain) for Amtrak vs. JetBlue are similar. Time from hotel to exiting the aircraft/trainset is similar. Flight is 1 hour or so but getting to JFK requires we leave Tribeca 2.5-3 hours before the flight time. Or we can leave Tribeca 30-40 minutes before our train is scheduled.    If pricing and time is the same which would you do (spoiler: I am leaning train she is leaning plane) ,Northern_Traveler00,New York City,California

My family and I are thinking about traveling from Philly to NYC between Christmas and New Years Eve. We'd like to see the SOL and the pedestal but the ferry website has this caveat:  Note: When choosing your time this is your entry into the Security Facility not the entry time into the Pedestal of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. The wait time can be several hours particularly during peak season including summer weekends and holidays.    If we go on a weekday will the wait still be several hours? I don't want to spend our whole day just on the SOL so I'm looking to see if that's an accurate time estimate. Thank you! ,Stephanie J,New York City,"Alexandria, Virginia"

Hello    My husband 16-year-old daughter and I will be attending the NYC Ballet Nutcracker performance at the David Koch Theater (Lincoln Center?) on a Friday in late December at 8 pm.    We'd like to get dinner beforehand. Any suggestions for nearby restaurants? We like all kinds of foods but an Italian place might be nice. We're open to ideas/suggestions. We're eating East Asian cuisine the next day.    In terms of price I'm hoping to find entree options priced under $50.    And what time would we want our reservations for assuming we can make them? 6 pm? 5:30 pm? Assuming the restaurant is within walking distance...    I appreciate any thoughts/suggestions. ,JKEWJ,New York City,Saint Paul...
We will be travelling in October and want to see the main sights. My question is........is there a better time to go to certain places i.e. best view is early morning for statue of liberty etc. We will be doing (at least):    empire state  statue of liberty - from boat only  central park  time square  brooklyn bridge  coney island (maybe)  china town/little italy  hallowen parade - where is the best place to see this??    We are trying to maximize our time and want to start booking some attractions so any advice gladly received ,Susan D,New York City,"Nottingham, United..."
We're staying with family in Long Island in November but want to do 1 night in Manhattan (possibly 21st November but can be flexible) so we can have 2 days of sight seeing. We've been once before so done the main tourist things so this time we're thinking:  - MAD Museum  - High Line  - Photo at Cornelia Street (daughter is a big Swiftie)  - Ice skating at Rockafella Centre  - Possibly a show (but looking too expensive)    We'll need 2 rooms as it's for 4 adults and 2 teenagers and ideally a budget of c$300 per night per room. I've seen a few options but completely overwhelmed with the different areas and hotels. Restaurants for lunch/dinner welcomed also (again reasonably priced).    Are there any areas or hotels you'd recommend? I've thought of Courtyard Manhattan/Soho Hyatt House Chelsea Moxy East Village Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea Hyatt Herald Square along with a raft of others. I've been assigned to research and book for us all so any advice much appreciated.  Thanks in advance. ,BelfastTaddles,New York City,Castlewellan...

I lived in New York in the 70s and like everyone I have fond memories of the food. Specifically:    Meatball sandwiches from a kiosk in the village    Souvla-king around 42nd Street    And ham and cheese from virtually every little store/deli.    Granted that there's a fair bit of memory enhancement here!    I'll be in NYC next month staying in Chelsea. Any suggestions for reliving the sandwiches of my youth? ,Roam826205,New York City,
https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/holidaynostalgiarides    The nostalgia trains will return to run their routes every Saturday in December.    They start at the 2nd Ave station on the F line and make a route uptown and back. See the link for the route and the schedule.    The fun thing about this train is that some passengers get dressed up in period costume there is a conductor in period costume and the train is an old one from the 1930's.    You can use this train like a regular subway ride to a destination along the route if you like or treat it like one big ride along the whole route.    The cost is the same as a regular subway ride using your Metrocard or OMNY. ,Aynat62,New York City,Greater Sydney...
As per my other question we‚Äôve been to NYC lots of times in other seasons so have spent lots of time exploring parks neighbourhoods and other outside attractions. When we visit next we land NYE and fly out 4th January.    Ideas of things to do?    So far we have on the list:    USS Intrepid    9/11 Museum    An observatory (already done TOTR and The Edge)    A day exploring Brooklyn and local stores    Ice skating (unsure whether to do Rockefeller or CP?)    Bumper cars on ice at Bryant Park (if started by then)    Wondered about Dakar Lights if they‚Äôre still on at that time?    Generally speaking we‚Äôll just be enjoying the city this time around with lots of hot chocolate stops and NY eats in there! ,vickilewis626,New York City,"Scarborough, United..."

Many thanks to everyone who helped us (me and DD age 13 with planning!    Friday - we arrived mid-afternoon to LGA and had pre-arranged a car with Carmel. Our flight was early and the driver was already waiting! It took a while to get to the pickup area but he was patient. We had booked the second cheapest option (luxury sedan 1-3) and were pleasantly surprised to see we were riding in a very clean and updated Escalade. Ride to midtown hotel at 50th and Madison was $75ish all in with tip and tolls.  Our room wasn‚Äôt ready so we stored our bags and headed out to shop. We ended up having to re-do a lot of our itinerary knowing that it was going to rain all day Saturday. We cancelled our dinner reservation and planned to stay outside as much as possible and just wing it for dining that night. We went to Rockefeller Center and made a bear at Build-A-Bear at FAO Schwartz. DD enjoyed her favorite pastime of giving more of our money to Lululemon and got a kick out of the 4 story location. Our Lulu in NC is tiny.  We went to some other stores then stopped to take several photos of a stroller full of enormous cats. Three of them - plump and happy riding on top of a cart and wearing berets.  We ended up joining the line for dinner at Ellen‚Äôs Stardust and got a great seat after about a 25 minute wait in line. DD loved the singing and enjoyed her food fine enough‚Ä¶.we split appetizers. Our waiter was really kind and very talented. I missed the chaos that there used to be before Covid‚Ä¶.last time I was there they threw much more confetti and straws and there were no tp streamers flying around. I know how wasteful that is and not-environmentally friendly but it sure was fun.  We got a good deal on Moulin Rouge tickets and went to the 7pm show. Orchestra seats and a terrific cast- we loved it! My only complaint would be that the seats are so tight‚Ä¶the guy next to me was manspreading so badly that I had to practically lay over on DD.  All of the performers were terrific especially Casey Cott as Christian. DD and I were thrilled to meet him and take pics at the stage door after the show. He took his time with everyone even though I think he has a new baby at home! We took a cab home and tried to sleep but our hotel was pretty crowded and loud with people coming in late night.  More to come! ,HolidayE,New York City,North Carolina

Hello all    I‚Äôve visited NYC multiple times over the past decade but always in the summer time. This time we will be arriving at lunchtime on NYE.    We aren‚Äôt bothered about the ball drop or booking an expensive restaurant cruise etc. our plan is to check in to our hotel (Yotel NYC) and then have a wander over to Hudson Yards a couple of drinks and look at the lights then make our way uptown towards the park getting a low key dinner along the way. Then head to Central Park via the UWS. We‚Äôd like to see in 2024 on the Bethesda Terrace.    My questions:    A) are we going to be able to travel in these areas without being impacted by road closures etc?    B) Will subways be running as normal? I assume so but best to check!    C) ideas for dinner? Happy with takeout etc and we‚Äôll likely end up ducking in somewhere that looks good and has space but if anyone has any particular reccies they‚Äôd be great!    D) where can we enter the park? I know there are only certain entrances open after a certain time on NYE.    E) can we walk the park during the early evening before we make our way to Bethesda Terrace?    Thank you in advance! ,vickilewis626,New York City,"Scarborough, United..."

The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced that the 45 or so galleries dedicated to European art before 1800 will reopen to the public on November 20 2023. They started allowing member-previews on November 17 so I went to take a look. This follows a long repair of the skylights above the galleries.    If you want to read about this the title of the exhibition is Look Again: European Paintings 1300‚Äì1800 https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/look-again-european-paintings-1300-1800    I'm talking about the galleries right at the top of the Grand Staircase from the Great Hall. The interconnecting doors to the American Wing and to the Musical Instrument galleries had also been closed for many months.    The Met states that the re-hanging of these galleries includes efforts to showcase more works by women and in the Spanish colonies of the New World.    This is evident from the very first gallery 600 in that the familiar Tiepolo paintings are related to empire and colonialism by including three-dimensional works from Rome Pakistan and Mexico. Gallery 632 is titled Hierarchy Gender and the French Academy.    Most re-exhibited paintings have been re-hung in a new location. There are a few surprising exclamation points like being faced with a famous Max Beckmann triptych in the second gallery 601 along with Italian Renaissance. And quite appropriately Chaim Soutine's 1924 Ray Fish is in 617 Still Life. There's a Dali in Spanish Religious and Picassos beside El Greco. I found one work by a living artist Kerry James Marshall in the gallery titled The Artist's Studio. ,obsoperator,New York City,"Bergen County, New..."

Hey Guys  Is a visit up the crown worth the time? On past visits to New York we always waved to her from afar but thought it might be a cool thing to do with our teens. We are pretty fit so stairs not an issue.  If you think it is a good idea I am not sure exactly what day to put it in... If we choose Battery Park ferry logically I think it would be a day we penned to spend down that way but I also don't want to feel rushed doing 9/11 museum which is more important to us. Would tagging it on to a day we do Chelsea/Highline make sense or is this too hard?    Any advise welcome. Thanks ,Night,New York City,

Planning a trip up the highway on Whiteface for next June and am curious about what is meant by closing time for the road. I see everywhere that it closes at 5:30pm however does that mean they only sell tickets to go up the highway until 5:30pm and that you can come down later than that or you have to be off the road by 5:30pm?    Just curious as we were hoping to go up before 5:30pm and watch the sunset then drive down afterwards.    Thanks ,Mike519,Wilmington,"Waterloo, Canada"

I know a lot of NY experts have inside information so just wondering.    The San Carlos was supposed to be under renovations in February 2024 which is why I didn't/couldn't book there earlier. Now those dates are available (for cheap too which is why I just booked). Renovations got delayed? Cheap because renovations will be happening in February?

Hello my dear folks I am back and ready to start booking our activities for next week. So late I know stressing out cannot sleep. We arrive this SUN and depart next FRI so really have MON TUE and WED for the experiences THUR is Thanksgiving and my special day so will go into watching parade and having a dinner. Looked at the weather forecast and it looks like MON has clear skies TUE complete overcast with 60% rain and WED again rain 60% with breaks of sun and cloud.  My question to you how true the forecast stays to what it shows a week out?  I am looking at booking Vanderbilt observation deck on MON (AM?) when it‚Äôs best time to go.  Boat ride to the Statue of Liberty with pedestal access most probably on WED as it shows at least some sun BUT it says stormy‚Ä¶ so maybe TUE is better? MON & TUE shows first availability starting 12.00 PM. I think you said the earlier it‚Äôs better to avoid security lines. WED shows 9.00 AM great availability. I guess I should go with WED around 11.00 AM? 9.00 AM would be too rough for us to make it‚Ä¶ unless you tell me that I will waste half of my day then we will make it to 9.00 am to have it efficient. 10.00 AM is sold out.  Depending on the above 2 activities and their timing will plan to squeeze in between Christmas Spectacular Starring The Radio City Rockettes lots of walking around Times Square and Central Park on foot and horse driven carriage and many other points of interest on foot. If raining dogs and cats will visit Mega Mall/American Dream. Would love museum American Museum of Natural History but kids could be bored in an hour (5 & 9 y/o) so not sure if worth the visit.  Appreciate your input so I can go ahead and lock it in tonight. ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada

We will be traveling to NYC for a short trip Dec 17-20. It's a bit overwhelming trying to plan this trip in a short amount of time. I think would be best if I could hire a local tour guide that can take us from Central Park to 9/11 Memorial and see sights in-between( via subway). Im not sure if this is too much to try and see in one day. Can anyone recommend a reputable company or know of someone that gives private tours? I would prefer a private tour instead of doing a group tour.    We will be staying in the Chelsea area ( 24th St)    Thanks in advance! ,Jakk,New York City,"Nashville, Tennessee"

Hello.    I have looked through many special occasion restaurant posts and not quite seeing what I am looking for.    We arrive late afternoon on November 29 the night of the tree lighting. We had originally planned to try to get to see the tree lighting but are heeding the suggestions of this forum and going to avoid that area.    We are staying in midtown and for our first night it‚Äôs just my husband and I before our friends join us the next day for Christmas festivities.    Since we arrive late afternoon I think just a nice dinner will be what we are looking for.    I had planned to walk to Hudson Yards to see their lights etc and was looking for a restaurant in that area and came across Peak. It looked cool because of the views and then we could see the lights at Hudson Yard as well.    But I am wondering if there are any other restaurants that may be nice for an anniversary dinner. Special ambiance or nice view and good food.    Do you think Peak is a good choice for what we are looking for or is there somewhere else I should be considering? I did book a window table.    I don‚Äôt think we want to stray too far away from midtown as I saw other posts with suggestions in Weehawkin and financial district etc and probably just too far considering we are just arriving and will be on the go a lot for the next 6 days.    Thank you in advance! If you all think Peak will be a good choice that is great too! ,Jocjayhay_9,New York City,"Calgary, Canada"
Hi there    We fancied visiting The Plaza hotel as I thought they had lovely decorations at Christmas time.

Hello  We are a group of 4 visiting NYC in coming weeks. Plan to use OMNY for all of us and pay thru the same contactless credit card. I read it basically charges for 12 rides and then all rides are free for that week till Sunday.    This is what I read on the OMNY website - You are limited to tapping and paying for yourself and 3 additional riders with the same payment method at a single OMNY reader. You may continue using the same payment method at a different OMNY reader. However if you do so the 4 free transfers associated with the original 4 taps will be forfeited. If you are traveling with more than 3 additional riders it is recommended that you use multiple payment methods to prevent the forfeiture of free transfers. Each payment method can support up to 4 riders and 4 free transfers on a single trip.    I was planning to use the same credit card for all the 4 pax. Will it work and allow us to swipe multiple times in close succession? If yes then how does the fare cap work since we will basically pay for 12 rides in 3 trips? ,AnjiA,New York City,"Portland, Oregon"
Hello. Used to go to Buffalo all the time in my teens and 20s. This was a while ago but our favourite wing joint was Buffalo Pizza Co. right next to Canisius College on Main St. Absolutely loved that place! Happened upon it one night when we tried to go to the Anchor Bar and it was closed for some reason. No pretense down home no frills lots of character and amazing wings and hoagies. The owners retired some years ago and now I have no idea where to go when in town. Last time I came through I tried the Anchor Bar again and they were out of wings (!) (there was a snowstorm that weekend and the truck didn't make it I swear I've never had any luck with that place) Can anyone recommend somewhere similar? TIA. ,urbanfoodie,Buffalo,"Toronto, Canada"

Day 1.  Up at 7am this morning for a flight from Heathrow to Jfk obligatory Airport pint or two then Feared the worst when a stewardess spilt a bottle of water over me 10 mins into the flight and thought it better not be one of them days.... But other than that it was a fairly straightforward 7hour flight.  Picked up baggage and then got the Air train and LIRR to pen station and a walk to double tree hilton Chelsea. Checked in and nice view of the empire state that looked even better lit up at night. I've seen a few reviews of issues with the lifts and were on the 19th floor but had zero issues in the 4 times we've used it so far.    After check in we decided to just get some food then chill out for the rest of the evening before an action packed day 2. I really wanted tacos and seeing as we had nothing else to do I made the decision of a 5 stop subway to Birria Landia on Bowery we could have got food closer to the hotel I'd seen them on YouTube and whilst I also want to try Los tacos I wanted to try their consomm√© and boy did it not disappoint. The consomm√© had a lovely sweet tomato flavour with a slight chilli kick and freshness of the Corriander. The tacos were absolutely beautiful as well. Not going to look at them in the same way and puts every taco I've had in the UK to shame.  After that subway back to the hotel and stopped for a few beers for the hotel room and pleasantly surprised to find a shop on the walk back selling all mannor of German beers so grabbed 6 bottles of weihenstephaner and retreated to watch crap on TV in bed while I'm sure the city that never sleeps is just getting started at 7pm however I'm on UK time still so it feels like 1am....cant wait to see what tomorrow brings.

We have been to NYC multiple times and don't feel the need to stay in Manhatten so looking for a hotel in Brooklyn Greenpoint or Williamsburg in the $250- 300 range per night. I think it may not be possible but if anyone knows y'all will be able to point me in the right direction.    Thanks Geri ,Geri W,Brooklyn,
Hello which area in New York City should we stay for 2 weeks? We like to stay at the quieter neighbourhood surrounded by some charming old apartments yet easy access to the public transport/walk to the main city attractions like Guggenheim Museum Central Park Times Square Broadway & etc. We booked a hotel near Central Park in Oct 2020üò® but we couldn‚Äôt get out of Australia back then.

My parents are coming back to Vancouver via JFK on Qatar Airways and then on JetBlue. I know they have to re-claim their bags during customs. Do you know where the baggage drop-off for connecting flights is? Is it right after customs while in the secure area or is it after the exit customs and enter the arrival hall of the terminal? Also does anyone know the wait times for Terminal 8 customs/immigration? The site only seems to show Terminal 4.    Thanks! ,Sunny,New York City,"Burnaby, Canada"
Hi first time to both NY and the US as part of a larger trip I arrive Newark 13:05 18th March leave 21st Mar 2024 10:00. Any areas to base myself or any that should be avoided solo female late 60s active and very mobile. Have a list of places to see only one I intend to spend on is a possible trip up the Empire State Bldg all other places I would just view.  List is‚Ä¶  Times Square...see    Empire State...go up if time allows    Ground Zero...see    One World Trade Centre...see plus the Oculus    Chrysler Building...see Lobby is open for free 8-6 Mon-Fri    Flat Iron...see    Central Park...Gapstow Bridge...see    Statue of Liberty...see from the Staten Island Ferry...free    Manhattan...see    Brooklyn Bridge...walk over    Rockefeller Centre...see    Trump Tower...see    5th Avenue...walk along see St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral    Grand Central Station...go inside    The Vessell...see in Hudson Yards then to The High Line...walk a part of it    Chinatown...walk in    Am I completely misguided in what I can hope to achieve? Can easily remove places from list. I need to map out a route with my interests marked‚Ä¶can anyone scan this and tell me if it‚Äôs doable please? I guess my hotel needs to be placed somewhere south of Central Park. I‚Äôve been suggested The Kixby by my Travel Agent but that is too expensive my budget for the 3 nights is around 650usd total.  Many thanks and all info is appreciated. ,Jill,New York City,"London, United..."
I‚Äôm planning a trip to New York for either the last week of March or the last week of May next year. It will be my second time and my 16 year old nieces first time. I have an idea of what we want to do. Visit Central Park go to the top of the Rock do the high line visit the 9/11 memorial walk the Brooklyn Bridge then just walk around and explore different neighborhoods. I stayed at the Sheraton Time Square last time. While the location was great especially for a first time trip I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the Greenwhich Village area. I‚Äôm looking for hotel recommendations for in or around that area. We‚Äôre staying for maybe 3 or 4 nights and my budget maxes out at 1000 with taxes for the hotel stay. Also being very close to the subway is important. I was thinking the Washington Square Park Hotel but hearing reviews of it looking tireddated and in need of an update gives me pause. Not sure how true that is. Cleanliness is the most important thing to me but something that‚Äôs also been updated would be nice. Any ideas? I would really like to stay around that area but am open to other ideas that you think would be better for a teenage girls first time in New York. Thanks! ,Stephanie K,New York City,"Pomona, California"

Visiting from UK with two teenage kids in late December.    Was booked to stay in Brooklyn apartment which was cancelled due to recent Licensing requirement changes.

We provisionally booked a Studio room at Pod51 in the city and also looking at Indigo in Brooklyn - as Pod51 is cancellable!

Hey Folks  Just wondering if anyone can help - I am visiting New York November and will be attending Damien Rice gig 29th November at Kings Theatre Flatbush. We are going to get the Q train which takes around 40mins and then it is a 10min walk to the theatre from Church Av. Aiming to get the subway around 7.15pm to get there around 8ish as I believe Damo will be coming on around 9ish.  My question is would I be best leaving earlier as I am unsure if the subway would be really busy that night as the Rockafella Xmas tree gets turned on that day.  Any recommendations welcome üòé  Thanks guys!  Justin ,JussyMucky,New York City,

Hi there    Im trying to get an idea of how much time approximately I would need to accomplish this itinerary.  Places we would like to visit on this day    Hudson yard  Vessle  Highline  Chelsea Market ( lunch)  Possible stop at Starbuck reserve (for SB obsessed teen)  Little island    I'm guessing getting over to Brooklyn to walk the Brooklyn Bridge back at sunset would not be possible with this schedule but I am unsure. Any help with timing and the order of events would be greatly appreciated.    Thanks in advance!! ,tinkertastic,New York City,Florida

Hi folks    We (a couple) are planning to visit the US for the first time in March's first week and have decided to start with New York. We are landing at JFK on a Saturday afternoon and the return flight is on the following Friday evening so have 6 full days excluding flight days. Only the flights are booked as of now and the rest are still in the research phase.    The plan is to see the usual touristy places (Times Sq. Empire State Building Observation deck at SUMMIT One Vanderbilt Status of Liberty etc.). We are not fussy eaters and have read NYC has an excellent food scene so not worried about food too much.    I would like your suggestions on a couple of things -    1) Checking hotels around midtown (primarily around Times Square) the cost per-night seems to be around $200-250. Is this the norm or are there some cheaper options? The goal is to stay within walking distance of the majority of spots.    2) Checking GMaps and I can see it would take 4-5 hours to visit Washington. Would it make sense to spend 4 days in NYC and 2 days in Washington? or would it be too much of a hassle for a single trip?    Any other insights for first-time visiters would be really appreciated.  Thanks ,Nadeem,,"Dublin, Ireland"

Traveling with teens doing the usual NYC stuff. Have the lodging narrowed down to the Warwick or the new Kimpton Theta. Your thoughts? TIA ,HGNOLA,New York City,New Orleans...
Buying tickets to Rockettes and it appears to me as pricey as a Broadway show. I have tried codes posted earlier: EMN35 TRICKORTREAT TRZOO HOLIDAY20 at Ticketmaster playing with various dates/times and not a single one worked.... Where else should I look? Was hoping for a bit of a discount. Comes to $400 for a decent (not best seat) for a family of 4. It does not look like any discounts for kids. Can you help with how to secure a deal?    Also I am pretty flexible with time and date for next week. Thinking 11 am/2 pm would be probably waste to sit through since while it's not dark perhaps it's best to explore around so looking at 8 PM next MON TUE and WED. We are from west coast and kids go to bad pretty late so should be no problem for our family. Checked out pricing more or less the same no matter the date or time.    Question to you I am not an evid theater goer so need help with what area should be better. Ideally up to $100/ticket. Is Orchestra 2/6 to the side better than 1st Mezzanine (2/6) to the side? or the opposite? Is it waste of money and I should top up my budget? I feel like it is important for the kids to sit closer so I would choose closer and to the side then let's say centre and further like 2nd/3rd Mezzanine? Or I am wrong in my thinking? Is there website where I can look up specific seats? ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada
Hi friends! My husband and I are coming the 1st week of December and it will be our 3rd time to the city so we have hit up all the touristy things. This time we are excited to see all the Christmas decor markets and shows.    His birthday is just before we arrive so I would like to do something super unique for him as this is our favorite place to travel to. Any suggestions? Anything that I am not going to find on must-to lists online?    Thanks in advance! ,Miranda & Kris,New York City,"Dallas, Texas"
I am struggling with itinerary paralysis in planning out our days in NYC. I had to make a work trip to NYC the first week of December. My husband and I decided sort of spur of the moment to take our kids a few days early and do lot of Christmas activities. Our kids are 11 and 9. We have been to NYC once but it was before a cruise departure so only a couple of days. My youngest doesn't really remember anything. I do believe we will be visiting NYC in the future so I don't feel pressure to see everything this time. Our travel style is to plan one or two big items a day and then just have a list of ideas of things that are in the area that would be interesting then we can sort of see how the day evolves. We all hate mad dashing from one thing to the next. I'm starting to stress because I'm not sure how best to lay things out and we do not have any dinner reservations. We are fine doing $60 per person for dinners our kids would likely survive on appetizers. They will probably want pizza one night and we enjoy local diners as well. We arrive at LGA on 11-30 at 11:30 am. Our hotel is Luma. Tentative plans/thoughts:    Thursday 11-30 - Drop luggage at hotel go to Bryant Park New York City Public Library Grand Central Terminal. Early evening need somewhere to eat nearby    Friday 12-1 - We want to do Rockettes this day but I have not booked the tickets yet. Struggling with what the best time would be. The rest of the plan is to just explore 5th Avenue look at the window displays FAO Schwarz and likely the Lego Store. St. Patrick's Cathedral SAKS light show. Possibly doing Top of the Rock Conservatory. Watch people ice skating our kids do not want to skate. Once again need some good ideas for food. Open to pretty much all cuisines except Italian.    Saturday - Plan was to explore Central Park and then do either the Met or AMNH. However I have thought about getting tickets for the NY Botanical Gardens Holiday Train show and GLOW which is only on this day. Is it worth it? I believe we would need to go back to Grand Central to catch the train. So then it doesn't seem like enough time for Central Park and a museum.    Sunday - I want to try to get Macy's Santaland reservations for this day. However should I just try and check every day and take one when/if I get it? Other things we thought about doing this day is Union Square Holiday Market or one of the NYC Holiday Cruises. Other Christmasy things I've seen are Gingerbread City at Seaport. The 3rd day is the one I am struggling with the most.    Monday - My husband and kids flight is not until 6:30pm from LGA. So we thought we could use the morning to maybe do MOMA or another museum.    My kids really do enjoy museums and they like to shop and look at different things. They love bookstores. They also love music and concerts plays etc. We really considered getting tickets for the Nutcracker but the day/times with 4 tickets available were not great and expensive. A Broadway show could be an option but we recently saw Lion King at Broadway Across America and they are not into Harry Potter. Not sure what show would be the best for their age.    I really do appreciate any feedback or advice I receive! ,Hayley M,New York City,

Hi I will be having a girls weekend Dec. 7-11 . We are wanting to see at least one Broadway show. I typically use the same day discount walkup box office but with the need to have a more secure plan people wanted to buy the tickets in advance.

Hi team.  Ok we have 6 full days in NYC 22-29 November. Really want to see as much Christmas stuff as possible. It's my second time and husband's first time.  First couple nights we are actually staying near Penn station Newark then we have 3 nights in lower Manhattan last night back near Penn station Newark for early flight out.  We are undecided on Thanksgiving as on one hand it's an epic chance to see the Macy's parade but on the other hand we are from NZ and I don't think I can deal with the insane crowd levels that will draw.  What would be a way to spend time in NYC but avoiding the parade? Preferably not lower Manhattan or Brooklyn as that's pegged for the last couple days and nights.  Black Friday. Another thing that could be absolutely amazing but I'd probably rather avoid (I didn't get to choose my flights as it was through my work). Is black friday really as crazy as they show it on tv?  Hubby said he'd love to volunteer at a shelter on Thanksgiving but I'm fairly certain I read somewhere or saw somewhere that shelters get inundated with volunteers at Thanksgiving and Christmas is this true? Or could we look into it?  I haven't been to NYC since early September 2011 It's probably changed alot I mean it literally changed within 2 days of my departure. I have a big list of sights to see and stops to make.  Are there any useful sights for finding out what's happening in the city where? I have the Christmas stuff like pier 15 and pier 17 markets etc...  Any other tips? Like speciality stores (Harry Potter m&m Hershey's....)?  My daughter loves anime is there a place I should check out to get stuff for her?  Any amazing book stores or speciality art supplies places?  Looked at hiring a car on Thanksgiving and going upstate but not sure if that's a good idea or with it??  Also if a state Park days it's closed for the season does that mean you can't go there?? ,CeeJaye33,New York City,"Christchurch, New..."
This is a live (to the best of my abilities) trip report for my lucky 13th visit to New York City. It‚Äôs a solo trip and it revolves generally around music and art hitting up the Brooklyn Folk Festival and some museums hence the punnish title. I‚Äôll be here for 4 nights which will undoubtedly end up being too short as it always is but I‚Äôm typing this in my room just after checking in so it feels like the whole world is out there for me.

Hello Folks    Due to a last minute change we're looking for a place to celebrate our 10 years together. I was thinking of the Rochester region. We will be driving from Mississauga Ontario.    Can the good folks here recommend a 3 or 4 day itinerary keeping below in mind?    Couple mid 30s 5 year old girl. Would be good to explore the area with some kid friendly hikes or attractions for a 5 year old. Not looking to keep it very busy will maybe enjoy indoor pool or water park one day if available.    Date of Departure we're thinking is Nov 29.    Not sure what can we do for the kid.    Any pointers would be appreciated.    Thanks ,Dheeraj C,Rochester,"Mississauga, Canada"
Hoping for some advice. I‚Äôve been doing research and speaking to people I know from NY or visit often.    Heading into Newark Penn Station from a Philly conference. Grabbing a Turo and then picking my wife 2 kids and mother in law from Newark airport.    We have a AirBNB in Montclair NJ. My wife has some family close to that area and we also want to be within 30 minutes of the America Dream Mall.    In total will be in Jersey for 5 days. With the plan to visit the city 2 of those days.    Since I will have a rental car. The plan is to drive into the city 1 day and park for the day and return after we sight see. I plan to go into the city around 10am and leave after 6pm. I am hoping that avoids some traffic.    The second day I was thinking of driving and parking at a Ferry across from the Hudson and taking that into the city.    I plan to avoid the subways mostly because my youngest can be very curious and if we have a stroller we do not want to inconvenience anyone and I hear a lot of stations do not have elevators.    Once in the city we hope to knock out stuff in walking distance and if needed take a cab wherever. I understand that can be expensive but that is already worked into the budget.    We hope to see. The tree of course. Macys Central Park carriage tour. Bryant park.    I personally could skip Timesquare.    Then the other day we maybe want to do ChinaTown and the 911 memorial. Stuff down that way?    We also have to work in a ferry ride that goes under the Brooklyn bridge and would like to spend a couple hours over that side in DUMBO area. This is a must die request for my mother in law that is a photographer.    Please advise. Any tips or suggestions would be great.    Anyone know the best ferry to go under the bridge? Hangout and then come back to Manhattan?    Is this too much to do in 2 days?    Driving into city ok? Ferry the other day?    I appreciate everyone. Thanks ,Casey A,,

Planning a trip for early-Feb that will include my daughter and her partner. I am looking for neighborhoods to visit that are slightly off-the-beaten path and places that I haven‚Äôt been to before. Two that I am weighing against each other are (1) East Harlem as I have had the Museum of the City of New York on my list for awhile. And even though it will be winter I would like to visit a bit of the northern end of Central Park assuming we have a decent day. And (2) Sunset Park specifically 5th Ave and Sunset Park itself. Plus hopefully a bit of Green-Wood Cemetery which has also been on my list for a long time. This would likely be on a Saturday and I think they would have a trolley tour which is a draw for me. Sunset Park has a year-round greenmarket on Saturdays I believe so I am wondering if that is good to visit?    So can anybody help me out by comparing and contrasting these areas? Have you visited the Museum of the City of New York? I hate to use the ‚Äúworth it‚Äù question but is it? By that I mean did you enjoy it? And why or why not? Would you go again?    I hate to say it but QTB‚Äôs thread awhile ago on the East Harlem & northern Central Park (he posted regarding almost exactly where I would be) left me a little rattled. There‚Äôs no need to avoid the 103rd Street station right? Should we take the bus instead? Same difference? (I have traveled a lot of the city with no qualms and if I hadn‚Äôt read that thread I likely wouldn‚Äôt think twice.)    I read that there is a bit of a ‚ÄúRestaurant Row‚Äù on Lexington. Opinions? Recommendations?    That‚Äôs about the gist of it. It really comes down to‚Ä¶ if you could only choose one neighborhood for a couple of hours which would it be and why? And of course lol where would you eat? üòã    P.S. we will likely be staying near Madison Square Park at the Broadway Plaza not in Jersey City as in my earlier post. ,mcwhippet,New York City,"Edmonton, Canada"
I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice on our trip. Both accommodation and itinerary.    We had a wonderful time! The hotel Renaissance Chelsea was a perfect location for us outside of the madness of Times Square but walkable to lots of places on our list including downtown midtown Chelsea West Village/Greenwich the high line and Hudson walks along the river. We only got 2 subways the entire weekend and did lots of steps!    We had a great meal at Da Nico‚Äôs in Little Italy amazing pancakes in Bubby‚Äôs Tribeca lots of delicious pizza. Lots of others as well too many to mention. Some nights we got take away back at the room as we were tired and wanted to rest our feet!    Our itinerary changed slightly based on weather (wanted clear days for certain things) it ended up looking like this (below) and worked really well in terms of walkable locations spreading out the highlights for us and the boys and seeing lots. This trip was with two teenage boys and they wanted to see the 'big sights' as well as explore areas they were familiar with from movies TV etc. We see lots of London shows otherwise we would have added in a show.    We got to see a bit of the Halloween parade (too many crowds for us so didn‚Äôt stay too long though).    Trip highlights for me was Summiit One Vanderbilt walking Brooklyn Bridge and cycling Central Park.    A few things to note that I didn't realise ‚Äì allow time to get through the airport on arrivals. There is a pretty big queue for passport/visa etc. Time to and from airport takes longer with traffic than you expect.    Our itinerary was:    ARRIVE SAT EVE:  ‚Ä¢ Chelsea market dinner - Los Tacos    SUNDAY LOWER MANHATTAN  ‚Ä¢ Bedford St ‚Äì Friends apartment  ‚Ä¢ Walk along Hudson River Park to Downtown  ‚Ä¢ 9/11 memorial and museum  ‚Ä¢ One world trade centre  ‚Ä¢ Oculus  ‚Ä¢ Wall Street NYSE on way to‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¢ Statue of liberty Staten Island Ferry  ‚Ä¢ SoHo shopping  ‚Ä¢ Little Italy for dinner ‚Äì Da Nico‚Äôs    MONDAY MIDTOWN  ‚Ä¢ High line to Hudson yards  ‚Ä¢ Times square day  ‚Ä¢ Joes Pizza Broadway  ‚Ä¢ Rockefeller centre  ‚Ä¢ Grand central Station  ‚Ä¢ New York Library  ‚Ä¢ 5th Avenue  ‚Ä¢ Summit One Vanderbilt -SUNSET/NIGHT SLOT  ‚Ä¢ Times Square night    TUESDAY ‚Äì LOWER MANHATTAN  ‚Ä¢ Tribeca area  ‚Ä¢ China Town  ‚Ä¢ Walk Brooklyn Bridge  ‚Ä¢ DUMBO and Brooklyn heights  ‚Ä¢ Timeout food market in Dumbo  ‚Ä¢ Washington Square Park  ‚Ä¢ Halloween parade    WEDNESDAY CENTRAL PARK AND HOME  ‚Ä¢ Central Park ‚Äì hire bikes and cycle park.  ‚Ä¢ Plaza hotel  ‚Ä¢ Walk along Hudson River Park to  ‚Ä¢ Intrepid museum  ‚Ä¢ Back to Chelsea hotel for home.

Plus and even better my nephews ran for a charity that I'm involved with and I met all of the other runners for the charity last night. My organization raised a TON of money as did so many others. It's a beautiful thing. Reps from the organization were on 120th and Fifth taking photos of all of the runners on our team.    I didn't run around the whole city chasing down my relatives (like other members of my family) but I did wait on Central Park South to see them come in for the last part of the marathon. One of my nephew's wife had her toddler daughter with her and when trying to push through the crowds with the stroller to meet my sister in law and me she gave up on the stroller. She parked it near The Plaza Hotel and hoped for the best.    The crowds were amazing. Cheering for everyone. One of the more poignant moments was seeing a man a half mile or so before the finish line cramp up and fall down. He was sitting on the street rubbing his calf and you could see the pain on his face. Another runner stopped helped him up put his arm around him and together they continued on their way the two of them holding each other up to make sure they both finished. I had tears in my eye with that one.    After the last of my family passed by (my brother at 60 years old completed his 19th NYC Marathon in decent time) we went underground to cross under CPS in an effort to circle around the crowds to go meet the family runners.    Guess what: the stroller not chained to anything just resting against the wall near The Plaza was still there untouched waiting for my niece to put her wearied daughter with the Elmo signs in the stroller to walk to their car stopping first for some ice cream.    We met our runners at 65th and Broadway at the northeast corner of David Geffen Hall and took lots of photos with help from passers by so we could get the whole family in.    Tomorrow night I get to put on a gown for our annual Gala where I am honored to give out an award and help with the appeal. (And yes I will be taking a subway in a full length dress with a train jewelry etc because that's how I roll especially during rush hour; afterwards we'll see.) But I'm still so proud of all of the runners who raised so much money!    Sometimes I really just love New York City. It's a great place to visit. But an even better place to live. ,Risa L,New York City,"New York City, New..."
Thinking of going to NYC over NYE weekend. If I stay in NJ or a Brooklyn is it easy to find transportation from Manhattan after midnight on a special occasion like NYE?

Don't know if anyone has already mentioned this but NYC now has a tea and sightseeing bus called Tea Around Town. Is operated by HoHo company called Top View I think topview.com. I assume this is to be like the one in London; have never tried either one. Say they leave 6-10 times a day from 42d between 5th and 6th. Standard tea is $69 the premium experience is $109 and you must book for at least two. ,Grandrue,New York City,

I apologize for my ignorance to your city being so close to you. Only thing I know about NYC is what I‚Äôve seen on TV. Planning a surprise 60 th trip for my wife. I do have some general idea of what I want to do but would like to hear from the locals on what I need to include . My ideas‚Ä¶  Spend some time in Central Park - horse and buggy ride Empire State Building ( as a retired Fire fighter) maybe 911 stuff do one maybe two broadway shows. Thinking about how big Toronto is  are the items I‚Äôve listed even remotely close?  Then I‚Äôm heading to Boston for a day because the Blue Jays are playing there. Any feedback is greatly appreciated  Thank you in advance  Steve ,Shellysteve,New York City,"Belleville, Canada"

Hi all. We are planning the end leg of a New England road trip. We were initially looking at staying in Williamtown MA for 2 nights then driving down for a pm flight back to Australia in mid September.    Our flight is now 2pm and we also want to be closer to Newark airport (maybe an hour or 2 away) so we are looking for somewhere to stay with a cute downtown area for our final night after a 6.5 week holiday in the USA. We'd then get on the road (route recommendation would be great) and drive to Newark to drop off car. Our flight is at 2pm so being an hour or 2 away is preferrable than Williamtown or an airport hotel.    We plan to meander on a scenic route from Williamstown via Mt Greylock to the next destination for check in wander around the downtown area have a nice dinner and a relaxing night (we will have been on the road trip from Sept 6th to Sep 17th by the time we fly out).    Beacon and Sleepy Hollow have some up in searches but open to any suggestions. ,julesgoldcoaster,,Sunshine Coast...
Where I can eat the best pasta in NY? ,Zuzanna P,New York City,"Sulkowice, Poland"
Hello my 10 year old daughter and I are coming to NYC to see the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving parade. I‚Äôve had a look at the Macy‚Äôs parade web page and read the information there. I‚Äôd be grateful for any practical advice to get the best experience for my daughter.    Eg can you come and go from the sidewalk for restroom stops and hot drinks or are there barriers? Once you‚Äôre there do you have to stay put or are you best to stay put?    Are there are viewing spots that have a slope which makes it easier for smaller viewers to see?    Any practical advice would be gratefully received. Thank you very much. ,Valerie H,New York City,
I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but found out that they charge a $25 cancellation fee. I may be old school but I have never made a reservation that I would be charged a cancellation fee. Actually I have never seen on place that charges this fee and I eat out quite often and in many states and countries .

Hello  Are shops and tourist attractions open between Christmas and new year? I‚Äôm looking at arriving on 26/27th December and departing 1st January.  Thanks ,Jane73,New York City,UK
Hi    I am travelling to New York 16th-20th December and would like a bit of support with my itinerary. We have been to NY once before and have done a lot of the traditional tourist attractions and the main point of this trip is to see NY at Christmas.    16th Arrive early evening at JFK- Tram from terminal 4 to Jamaica Station then Subway Sutphin Blvd-Archer Av-JFK Airport to 50 St New York (Is this the best option for cheap transit to Manhattan?)    17th- Take the train to City Hall and walk across Brooklyn Bridge. Visit Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Market then take the ferry back to East 34th Street. Bus across to Chelsea Market then walk the High Line to Hudson Yards. Santa's Immersive Holiday Experience at 7pm    18th- 10am showing of the Rockettes (Any discount codes please??) then walk north on 5th avenue seeing the store windows etc. Finish in Central Park and spend some time here. Afternoon tour of Dyker Heights and end the day at Bryant Park Winter Market    19th- Shopping at either Woodbury Common or The Mills. New Jersey Devils vs. Philadelphia Flyers Ice Hockey. Looks like the best way to get to the Prudential Center is South Ferry Station to Penn Street and then onto Pennsylvania Station is this correct? Any issues with getting the train after the game?    20th- St Patrick's Cathedral Macy's Herald Square Rolfs Union Square Market. Flight home from JFK at 21.45.    Does this all sound doable? Am I missing anything in particular any 'do not miss' Christmas activities?    Any help would be appreciated! :-) ,sellis1985,New York City,

We are visiting New York at the beginning of December and thinking of having a day combining a walk across Brooklyn bridge and then a visit to the one world observeratory and 9/11 museum. We are thinking of visiting on a Saturday or Sunday.    Can anyone advise on what order we should do this and if it‚Äôs doable in a day? We will be travelling from a hotel near Times Square so presumably can take the subway.    I have thought about taking the statue cruise to Ellis Island and actually going to the statue but am worried about the queues and time this will take. Is it worth going in December when the weather could be bad and will we have time to do this as well?    Any advice much appreciated ,Dinah_family,New York City,"London, United..."
Hi all.  Visiting New York with my 2 children (10 and 12) 12-17 December. I have been once before in my early 20's but was really only interested in bars back then! We arrive into JFK and staying at the Benjamin royal. I've been looking at this forum for a few weeks now and have somewhat of a plan together.. We arrive on the 12th at 2pm (pre -clearance in Dublin so shouldn't be too long getting out of airport). Plan to either uber or taxi to hotel. I'm not sure how our jetlag will be so just plan on Bryant park for food and wander and an early night. I'm going to take advantage of the time difference and try and have early nights and early mornings.    For the 13th I have booked Statue of liberty for 1pm. I didn't want it too early as I'm trying to allow for the possibility of jetlag and not sure how it will effect us.    I then want to have one main activity a day and then wander time around said activity. Basically I'll build out the day based on the location of the activity. I'm big into soaking up the atmosphere sitting in coffee shops and people watching so one activity a day is probably enough for us. There will probably be a lot of shopping too! We leave late on the 17th but even so think it best not to wander too far that day. My son is very excited about the huge Nike store so unfortunately looks like there will be a lot of time spent there!    The other 3 days we want to ice skate do an observatory and a broadway show.  I've narrowed ice skating down to central park.  Observatory to Summit one - would like to go at sunset.  Broadway show matinee and not too fussed on the show so will probably just go to ticket booth. I've looked at what is available now on that site to get an idea.  I might group in Ice cream museum color factory or Madame Tussauds with another day/evening if it's raining    I've seen people say not to book in advance for Observatories due to weather but I've also seen people say it's sold out for their dates. Should I book Summit one in advance and ice skating in central park?    I would love some restaurant recommendations. The kids want to eat pancakes so breakfast ideas either around hotel or near one of our main activities. I'm a big foodie but given it's just me and the kids we will probably keep it simple. The main food we would all be happy eating is Italian so any recommendations for casual(ish) Italian around the hotel or main activities. The exchange rate isn't great so preferably $20 - $30 per main. I would prefer not to book but maybe I have to..    Also I see noted kids menus aren't big in the US. My kids won't eat an adults portion so not sure of the options. I've seen people say their kids share a meal but getting mine to agree on the same dish would probably be a challenge. Will restaurants do half portions?    We plan to get around by subway kids are well used to Paris metro so no issues here. I plan to use my credit card and the kids have revolut cards. We would like to avoid subway after 8 or so. We were recently on the metro after 10pm and while it was probably in my head I felt a little uncomfortable.    Please excuse my ramblings... But any advice suggestions or tips would be truly welcome. ,Lydia A,New York City,Newtown Mount...
Hi we have previously been to New York 6 years ago and stayed at the Novotel Times Square now the M Social Times Square we thought it was a good hotel in a good location and were thinking of staying again but have read this area is now not recommend? Budget of around $600 per night happy to go higher for the right hotel. Two 30 somethings not fussy as long as it‚Äôs clean and good location. Realise we have left this very late any help would be greatly appreciated thank you. ,Sarah G,New York City,"Gourock, United..."
The hubs and I (mid 60‚Äôs) having been to NYC once before and crammed a lot in decided to come up this time mainly for the museums and a couple of shows. I was also excited to see some fall color since we don‚Äôt get much of that in Central Florida.  This report covers days 1 and 2 and I will add further installments as comments on this thread; I hope that works ok.    Monday (having been up too late packing) we spent most of the day flying up to JFK from Orlando taxiing to our hotel (M Social at Times Square thanks to those on here who recommended them last time we came!). We went next door to Gallagher‚Äôs a nice steakhouse and got a chopped steak for hubs and grilled shrimp for me. Hubs rated the chopped steak as a 9/10 almost as good as his favorite at Linda‚Äôs La Cantina in Orlando. My shrimp was excellent if partly wasted on me since I was practically falling asleep onto my plate. We turned in early and slept almost 12 hours.    Day two Tuesday: One of my favorite things about M Social is that it‚Äôs across the street from Angelina‚Äôs a bit dangerous for my sweet tooth. We had breakfast there skipping the $30 buffet at the hotel and took the subway to the Met Cloisters. My GPS told me to take the C train to Dyckman street but around maybe 165th we heard ‚Äúlast stop‚Äù So we got off checked the maps and got on the A train to complete our journey. Stopped at Starbucks (since my research told me the museum cafe was closed for the season) and then walked along and through Fort Tryon Park about a 10 minute walk including some steep stairs or a more gradual winding path. For those concerned I did see a city bus at the entrance atop the hill so presumably that would be an alternative.    We really enjoyed the Cloisters both its architecture and the medieval art and of course the unicorn tapestries. We were just in time for the free one hour tour which I recommend.    We took our time walking back down since I was taking pictures of the landscape all the way. After another stop at Starbucks we took the A train back to the 50th street stop without incident. Tested at the hotel (52nd street) then went to the Times Square Diner which I‚Äôd seen recommended on here. I was very impressed with my chicken salad sandwich; hubs less so with his seared chicken plate (although I thought it was good). All in all it was a very pleasant day.  Hopefully more in a day or two. Tomorrow we aim to see the Guggenheim and then the Back to the Future musical. ,almostfloridanative,New York City,"Orlando, Florida"

Hi everyone    A couple years ago (Oct 2021) my wife and I spent 5 days in LES/East Village. I had a couple threads then one asking for restaurant advice and then a follow-up trip report. So we're coming back for our 7th trip (since 2017) to the city and this time will be staying at the Maritime in Chelsea. Our plans are to spend a lot of of our time walking around eating/drinking and taking in the neighborhood. We'll make a few trips out...Bryant Park Winter Village MoMA Rockefeller Center but hopefully will find a lot of places to spend time in that area (along with West Village/Greenwich Village).    What are some of your favorite Chelsea/ West/Greenwich Village restaurants? Bars (I'm into bourbon/whiskey)? Hangouts?    Our forays into Chelsea in the past have consisted mainly of Chelsea Market (we've done Los Tacos and Very Fresh Noodles) and walking the High Line.    Wife likes (I'll add some notes for our tastes):    Indian (Veeray da Dhaba was a hit in EV)  Asian/Thai (loved Wayla and Pig and Khao)  Pizza (we'll hit my fave John's of Bleecker but always looking for others wife loves Neopolitan like Juliana's and Keste)  Mediterranean (loved RinTinTin)  Bagels for breakfast (wife loves a good bagel with cream cheese salmon capers onions)  Coffee houses (I pay dearly if wife doesn't get her morning coffee LOL)    Anything else that might be interesting (love museums we've done the Whitney)?    Thank you!    Edited to add dates: Dec 20-24 ,Larry O,New York City,Washington

I'm trying to book 5 nights in mid March in Manhattan ideally Times Square or ish. I need 4 beds for 4 of us (2 adults and 2 older teens). My budget depends on value but ultimately I'm trying to keep it to $4k (total so if I need 2 rooms that would be $400 x 5 nights x 2). It's been super annoying because every tool I have (including Marriott where I'm platinum) show rates for 1 king and then when I click on the 2-bed rooms the price spikes and/or I can't use points and/or I can't use the special rate codes I have etc etc. I really wish there was a booking system that let you search for 2 bed rooms only. If anyone has any suggestions on how to find/book for people who need 2x bed rooms only I'd love to hear it...    I've zeroed in (as seems popular here) on RIU. It seems they have 2 properties (even that took a while to suss out) but I think the Manhattan property is the one I want vs the New York property based solely on room configurations. Here are my questions:  * I can't seem to figure out the difference between the 1 Deluxe two Queen beds and the 1 Deluxe family twin. The latter has the same (queen) beds even though is called twin and even the same room pictures -- but claims to be 4m^2 (or about 36sqf) bigger - and it's $30/night more -- but there's no indication where that extra space appears in the room.  * The RIU rates I'm seeing have room only and Bed and Breakfast. It's a LOT more expensive for the B&B rate - like $232 per night more for the B&B vs Room only. Why would anyone pay $116 per person for breakfast? Especially when so many people complain about the wait times and how hard it is to even get breakfast. My suspiscion is that they are tranisitioning from free breakfast to paid and that with rate codes and offers they're just going to see where the sweet spot might be to including it or not. Regardless - I don't care about the free breakfasts.    My plan is spend some time on good friday looking for deals. I would really love to stay at a decent Marriott given my status there but it's so hard to search and anything that looks reasonably priced is negative-feedbacked to the extreme. ,Tinious,New York City,Ottawa

We will be visiting NYC on Friday 12/15 and coming from New Haven CT. Ideally we would like to stay in the city. It seems the most convenient as we are seeing a show at 7pm Friday night so I would like to get something close to that. If we can find a hotel for a decent price. I am willing to go up to $500 a night. I have not picked a hotel so we are flexible on that. Where do we park at? I don't think my husband wants to drive into the city I think we will get there before noon on Friday so if we park outside the city what would we do with our luggage before check in time.

NYC has always been a place of many cultures and diversities. Sometimes they get along usually they at least tolerate each other and rarely are they at each others throats this might have most famously happend during the civil war when there were draft riots by the Irish who did not want to fight for the African Americans (These riots were really bad and led to NYC leaders raising money to pay for anyone who didnt want to go (During the civil war you could pay a few hundred dollars and not be drafted))    Right now NYC is not in a good place and I do belive tourists should be aware of this there are major tensions in the city related to outside events. You are not in danger or anything but it might be best to keep your opinions to yourself on international affairs if you see anything related to these events. If you see anything related to these events and its likely you will Just move along and dont express any views on these issues. Alot of these tensions are flaring up at very public places so its very likley you might see something    As a lifelong New Yorker  these is some of the worst I can remember the city being regarding tensions between New Yorkers and people are expressing their views very publically. And some people are deliberatly gaslighting things further If you see people gaslighting Go somewhere else    Just come and have a good time and ignore outside events and dont get involved and you will be fine ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City

I‚Äôm hoping to stay somewhere in the city but not very picky where just as long as it has easy access to a bus or subway and the area/location is safe.    Thanks! ,Mack B,New York City,
Hi there we are coming to NYC for Christmas - staying 20-28/12. We have booked a hotel in LES but seeing increasing reviews talking about terrible hotel nightclub noise guests for Thursday to Saturday.    I am looking to change hotels. We are a family travelling together with 2 parents and 2 young adult sons. So we'd need one of our hotel rooms to have two bed (any size fine).    Price range $360(USD) per room per night. Ideally not in Times Square. Open to any of the other neighbourhood type areas close to subway stations.    Any suggestions? Finding it very hard. Thanks! ,Kelly Taylor,New York City,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi everyone we would like to spend a few days in the city next fall but are mindful this will be in the run-up to the next USA election. From overseas it looks like there could be some disruption and we are being advised by local US friends to avoid this period. Just wondered how it feels to those of you living locally and what your thoughts would be. We are interested in arts museums and countryside not nightlife (in general) or shopping!    We would be thinking of some time in Pennsylvania and Utah NP and possibly Shenandoah travelling primarily by train and will be asking on those pages too.

My flight arrives at 5.25 a.m. at JFK. My check in is at 3 p.m. What can do I while I wait for it? The wearher forecast syas it might be a rainy day. Where could I spend some hours (eating is out of the table because I usually have a good snack at the airport) and where could I safely store my luggage?  The hotel doesn't allow early check in nor storage my luggage prior to 3 p.m.    Ps- I saw a walmart supercenter near JFK with other shops and I thought about spending some time there to stretch my legs but not sure if this is the best option. ,carlajdi,New York City,State of Sao Paulo

Hi    We will be visiting NYC for our second trip in August 2024 staying for 9 nights at the Romer Hell‚Äôs Kitchen before staying for 5 nights in Philadelphia. We are 2 adults and 2 very well travelled kids who will be aged 9 and 11.    It will be hot and we will be jet lagged so we‚Äôve tried to keep our days fairly light. I‚Äôd love any feedback on this - do please point out any glaring problems or omissions.    My family has tasked me with two additions which I‚Äôm struggling with. Please help if you can.    1. They‚Äôd like to see an American sports match of some kind. Are there any sports games during August? Basketball or baseball for example? Even a pre season friendly/warm up?    If so is it easy to get tickets? (We are by comparison thinking about how we always advise visitors to the UK that Premier league soccer in England is really hard to get tickets for).    2. My kids are obsessed with the Spiderverse films and games and Miles Morales. Yes I know it‚Äôs fictional but aside from swinging between Manhatten‚Äôs buildings are there any locations which fans would love to see? Or experiences? Perhaps there is an upcoming exhibition of graphic material and storyboards? Or an immersive Spiderman experience. Wishful thinking I know but I thought it worth asking the NYC experts here.    Many thanks :-)      Tuesday August 6th  Arrive into JFK 6pm    Wednesday 7th  MOMA (big priority and want to spend longer here than the 2 hours we managed during our last trip)    Thursday 8th  MoMath Union Sq Washington Mews Washington Sq Architecture centre    Friday 9th  High Line Chelsea Market and Whitney    Saturday 10th  Prospect Park & Botanical Gardens Dumbo markets    Sunday 11th  Alphabet city lower east side & tenemant museum  (We have saved to google maps various sites cafes and points of interest so planning a decent walk around this area)    Monday 12th  Natural History Museum and Central Park    Tuesday 13th  Intrepid Hudson River Parks and Piers    Wednesday 14th  TBC  Sports game or theatre show? ,Wild Rumpus Travel,New York City,"Sheffield, United..."

Hi hoping to travel to NYC this year to get married. Just a quick question for anyone who has recently used the online booking system for Licence and then Ceremony using the City Clerks Project Cupid site. It all looks fairly straightforward the only thing is when trying to book an appointment for the Wedding Ceremony it asks for details of the witness there will only be two of us and planned to ask someone at City Hall to be our witness but obviously we won‚Äôt know their details until then is it ok just to put ‚Äúunknown‚Äù at present? Also it asks for a Wedding Licence number and the date it was issued again we won‚Äôt be collecting this until we arrive in NYC a couple of days before the wedding is it ok just to advance date it with the date of our appointment and the reference number provided after competing the online section of the application?

I want to take my 3 nieces and my sister to NYC for holiday festivities. Two of my nieces have never been to NY at all and I want to show them how magical the city is at Christmastime.    We won‚Äôt be able to afford Radio City Music Hall and skating in Rockafeller at night like when I was a kid but I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll still be a wonderful time for them!    I am looking for a hotel for under 300 a night if possible. I don‚Äôt know if we could squeeze 5 of us in one room but we would be willing to pack it in if I could save money. If not two hotel rooms for under 500 would be best. We don‚Äôt need to be in Mahattan (in fact I‚Äôm sure we can‚Äôt at the price) but somewhere either in a different part of the city or outside of the city with access to the train. I would even be willing to stay in CT if it meant that we could sleep comfortably and still be able to get to the city within 45-60 mins.    If anyone can offer trip advice for this or have any good hotel ideas please send them my way. ,Kerri P,New York City,Worcester...

My mum and I are coming to NYC for 5 nights on 10 January to celebrate our 60th and 40th birthdays and we would like to see a couple of shows.  I believe broadway week will fall within our dates?  If so how does it work?  Do we need to purchase our tickets beforehand or will there be offers on the day we want to see a show?  We‚Äôve seen quite a lot of shows which are on broadway so there isn‚Äôt a show we are desperate to see. We are quite happy to see what deals are available when we are there if that is the better option. Or happy to book tickets for shows beforehand if it will get us a better deal.  Which is the best option?  Also would broadway week cover off broadway shows (Little Shop of Horrors)?  Again not desperately wanting to see any shows however if we had to choose it would be little shop of horrors mj the musical or sweeney Todd.

Hi all!    I have managed to get myself some billy Joel tickets for June 8th 2024 for one of his last Maddison square garden shows.    Coming over from the UK I am aware that the tickets are ‚Äúsubject to change due to the playoffs‚Äù    Now being a Brit my knowledge of US sport is far from brilliant!! But from what I understand this concerns the NY rangers and the Knicks getting into / progressing into the playoffs.    I just wanted to know what the chances of this are at the date being moved? Have a schedule of the playoff dates been released at all and do either team look like they would make progress that could affect this date?    Any help would be greatly appreciated as coming from the UK with dates and things it makes it slightly more awkward when booking flights etc!    Thanks in advance! ,LukeRut,New York City,

Hi I‚Äôm looking for advice for my daughters 21st birthday we‚Äôre planning on booking New York for January next year staying in Times Square and just after some fun cool things to do. I‚Äôm not the best at planning things like this and it‚Äôs very overwhelming üôà.

Fine dining definitely isn‚Äôt something she‚Äôd enjoy so I‚Äôm looking for more relaxed recommendations and also just maybe some must see things that would suit her. I‚Äôd love to book us in for a tattoo to mark the occasion so if anyone has any recommendations for that that would be great too. Also if there‚Äôs anyone with knowledge on how I could get maybe a balloon and cake delivery to our hotel or something along those lines I‚Äôve searched the forum but posts are so old most of the links don‚Äôt work anymore.

IT's been 5 years since our last NYC visit and we are excited to spend Thanksgiving in NYC this year! Looking for some ideas to fill the gaps. We are a family of 4 (2 boys 8 and 11) staying near Chelsea. At times we will be with other family who are also staying in the area or who live in Queens. We have been to NYC many times but the kids haven't been since they were little. We do not need to see everything and we are focusing more on NYC holidays. I will put what we def have plans and then list the few extra things we want to do.    Tuesday:  arrive at Newark about 1:30 and will uber it to hotel  *No plans for this afternoon or evening yet maybe Union park market    Wednesday:  Lunch near AMNH (suggestions?)  Balloon watching from 1-3pm  Holiday Train show at NYBG (4:15 tickets)  dinner Arthur Ave. (suggestions?)  *Best way to get to AMNH and then to Bronx with 2 grandparents who have trouble with stairs? We would be there to help for a subway but don't know if we should just Uber)    Thursday:  Parade!!! My plan is to walk up 7th til we get to about 38th and cut over to 6th getting there around 7am? Anyone have a better plan?  -Afternoon dinner plans are being taken care of by family.    Friday: Christmas in NYC day  Some of this day will be based on if and when we get a Santa reservation at Macys. My alarm is already set to be ready to go at 630 Sunday morning. I will be trying for as early as possible even if that 8am since we are staying not too far from Macys. But my basic plan is to walk 5th Ave real slow this day and hit up markets and flagship stores (my kids are NOT shoppers but like a good toy store). Hopefully I can run into a me store here or there too for a black Friday sale lol. So the ideal plan would be:  Macys  Bryant Park market  NYPL  Nintendo store  Lego Store  SAKS  FAO  Microsoft store (McLaren simulator)  MOMA design  and so on up to see the window displays when it gets dark a little early.    Saturday: early flight home    So the one thing that must be added to this list is ice skating. My first thought was Bryant Park on Friday but I hate having to wait to book tickets til after I know about Macys. I know we could do it Tuesday or even Wednesday morning as well. Open to skating at Bryant Park Rockefeller or Central Park.  -I also kinda wanna see the Rockettes but I may be the only one excited for it. Biggest advantage is that its less expensive then the other shows Id want to go to as a family (Lion King or Harry Potter)  -I am trying not to drop $200 bucks an activity either so free or low cost ideas are welcome. I know they'd enjoy an observation deck but not sure we will do that this time.  -If weather is bad I think my top museum choices will be the Intrepid math museum and/or MOMA.  -We have done the high line and Chelsea market before.    Thanks in advance for the help! ,BANT17,New York City,"Tampa, Florida"

Hello- On Wednesday I am traveling to JFK Terminal 5 on JetBlue and then have 1 hour 48 minutes before my Icelandair flight departs from Terminal 7 (they have a code share and this is all one ticket). I did not realize there was a terminal change. Does anyone know if my bags will be checked all the way through or if I need to get them from baggage claim and recheck them? If its the latter that seems like an awfully short connection time but this is what the airlines offered on one ticket..

I saw the thread on Cold Spring and I thought I would make my own    I did not do myself this exact trip so this is a piecemeal of 2 trips and I drove    You can take Metro North to Cold Spring Station from Grand Central Now either take a Shuttle bus is short taxi ride to Boscobel  Boscobol is a house from 1804 built by wealthy Loyalists. It was moved to its current site overlooking the Hudson and West Point. Take a tour of the Mansion and the grounds      When you are finished here either take the shuttle or a taxi back to Cold Spring Metro North Station the station is right in the center of town    Your first stop here should be the Moo Moo creamery and get some out of this world ice cream. Now take your ice cream and walk along the waterfront there are some parks here with great views of the Hudson River and the mountains on the other side of the Hudson    Now you can walk up Main St and visit the very electic shops that are here Very much a hippy vibe    When you are done you can just get to the train station its right in the center of town and then ride back to NYC    If yoiu have a car you can drive to nearby Fahenstock St Park very quiet and less visited NY Sfate Park ,Queenstravelbuff,,New York City

Hi all    My wife 2 kids and I are planning a trip to the U.S next October. We have always wanted to witness fall foliage in New England so next year it will fit into our city trips to Boston & NYC.    We are an outdoorsy family and enjoy nature so are looking for rural destinations. We are restricted to the middle (arrive 18/10) to late October due to U.K school holidays. Which areas would potentially be peak leaf peeping colours at this time? (I appreciate it varies year to year)    Suggestions greatly appreciated.    Thanks so much    Stefan ,CheUK81,,"Sheffield, United..."

My wife and I are taking a trip to NYC for our wedding anniversary. This will be the first time for both of us. First we would like to go to the Top of the Rock Cruise around the Statue of Liberty and maybe a couple of other sites. In 2023 what is the best way to get discounted tickets? Also we are staying in NJ by the Meadowlands but flying in to JFK since it was the cheapest and had no layovers. Best inexpensive and safest way to get from JFK to the Meadowlands.

Hi we are planning getting married at city hall Manhattan early May next year. Have seen online that you need to book an appointment to get a marriage license and collect in person and then wait 24 hrs before we can get married. Once we have booked an appointment ( we are in the UK)  understand they are released 3 weeks in advance can we then book a date and time for the ceremony for say 2 days later again from the UK or do we need to wait until we are in New York and have competed the marriage license appointment before we can go online and book a ceremony appointment? Also looking for recommendations for a photographer who could also be a witness and then take some photos afterwards around the city. Not looking for anyone too expensive though. ,Karen J,New York City,

Thinking of adding a show to the itinerary for the week of Nov.19-24. We will have children with us 5 and 9 y/o so would like to balance that will work for them too. From what I saw Aladdin and Lion King seems like fitting.l although very long‚Ä¶ Our kids are not fans of either but I am hoping that it will be still nice to watch. Which one is more mesmerizing if you will?    They are fans of Back to the Future but I just cannot picture it in the musical format. And I feel like not seeing such iconic things such as Lion king would be perhaps a lost opportunity. I never seen myself but certainly picture fabulous costumes and good moves.    Am I missing perhaps there are some others that I am not aware.    Which one would you your recommendation?    Thanks a bunch. I hope this will be a quick decision and I won‚Äôt labour you and myself like in other posts. ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada
Came across this and I thought it was worth a special mention. Ice skating is coming to Brooklyn Bridge Park starting November 15. Running until March 1 Glide will be at Emily Roebling Plaza tucked under the Brooklyn Bridge. The website says it will feature iconic views of Manhattan.    Rates for a 50 minute session run between $9 and $25 depending upon age time of day and if you are a NY resident. Skate rentals are available. Timed tickets are available online. I think you can also buy them at the box office on site.    There will be food and beverage. The offerings just haven‚Äôt been announced yet.    Easy to get to with the F train (York Street) A/C (High Street) or take the NYC Ferry to the Dumbo/Fulton Ferry stop.    I think it sounds wonderful! ‚ùÑÔ∏è üòé ‚ùÑÔ∏è More info here:    https://glidebk.com    https://instagram.com/glidebk?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA== ,mcwhippet,New York City,"Edmonton, Canada"

Hi we're planning on visiting New York from the UK for the first time next September. We arrive on a Thursday afternoon and we're thinking of spending Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun in New York then going to the Hamptons (or an alternative nice beach place with good restaurants and holiday vibes!) for Monday/Tuesday and leaving early on Wednesday morning for JFK (10.00am flight to Las Vegas). Does this sound like a feasible itinerary? My biggest concern is how we get from Hamptons to JFK without a car on the Wednesday morning. Would a taxi be too expensive or risky? Any advice on where to stay or how to get around would be much appreciated. I would say we have a reasonable budget. ,lisasud,Hamptons,"Bath, United Kingdom"

Hi    My husband and I are travelling from London (UK) to New York for four nights from October 23rd until October 27th.    It's our first holiday without the kids since our eldest was born 14 years ago and our first time in NYC and the USA so we're super excited!    We had expected hotels to be around ¬£100 a night but it seems that most hotels around Manhattan are at least double this. I've been looking on all the major sites (Booking.com Hotels.com Expedia.com IHG Accor Hostel world etc) and I've checked a few hotels directly but have not had much luck finding something suitable.    We're not too picky but would like a private room with double or king size bed ideally with private bathroom but sharing is OK too. It needs to have a lift or not too many stairs as I'm disabled.    We're used to subway travel (having travelled on the London Underground my whole life) so don't mind 30-40 minutes of travelling if need be but the closer the better.    If anyone has any suggestions that would be great!    Thanks in advance!    Kitty üòÅ ,CourageousKitty,New York City,"London, United..."

Summer in NYC gets going!    (Events thread originally started back in the day by ztaks!)  (None of the vids in this thread I post are mine.)    -June 17 2023 is the VERY cool Mermaid Parade in Coney Island!  Starts at 1pm/FREE/family friendly!    Expect extravagant costumes huge crowds(weather permitting) relaxed drinking enforcement by the NYPD(on the boardwalk and common areas) and just a great time!    A manager at Nathan's once told me that the Mermaid Parade is the 2nd most crowded day at CI behind July 4th!    The parade runs down Surf Ave and then winds around and comes back up the boardwalk    I try to not miss this event!    https://www.coneyisland.com/mermaidparade    https://youtu.be/idngzSvINk4    ^  Coverage.    https://youtu.be/q4dRF3RC_qc    ^  The parade winding down as it heads back up the boardwalk. ,ter1413 üá∫üá≤,New York City,"Brooklyn, New York"

From what I understand the General Grant National Memorial was closed on March 16 2020 due to COVID-19 and reopening has been a gradual process. The outdoor spaces were reopened in August 2020 while the main floor of Grant's Tomb itself was reopened in November 2021 on weekends only which was extended to Wednesday-Sunday in April 2022. However the Visitors Center and restroom facilities are still closed to the public. So does anyone here know when the restrooms and Visitors Center will reopen and what problems they have with reopening that Grant's Tomb itself does not have? ,Try2,New York City,
Now that I have the hotel and airfare booked will dig further into booking a restaurant for that special occasion night.    We are a family of 4 (2 adults) and 2 kids (6 & 9 y/o). Never been to New York have special milestone to celebrate on Nov.23 (US Thanksgiving) and will be planning to book a nice restaurant with the view. Trying to avoid Thanksgiving dinner and hoping that there will be other options available and the restaurants of interest will be open.    If you could suggest good restaurants that have nice view higher up almost like when you experience when you go to an observation deck that would be great. Type of cuisine doesn‚Äôt matter as long as this is not some sort of over-the-board gastronomical food experience as we are with children so need decent traditional choices. Thinking rooftop alfresco not an option at all this time of the year‚Ä¶.    I like a good traditional old school feel don‚Äôt like open kitchen concept lounge music or traditional American jazz could be in the background but not too stuffy environment either where you can hear ‚Äúflies fly‚Äù cannot stand snobbish servers culture because the place is too important type of a thing üòä    During my research I saw the following. Please comment suggest any other.  Chart House  the Press Lounge  R Lounge at Two Times Square ‚Äì not very high but perhaps iconic  Bar SixtyFive  St. Cloud Rooftop  The Skylark  Spyglass  The Top of The Standard  One World Observatory Restaurant  Manhatta    Very much appreciate your input. ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada

I will fly to NYC in March 2024 and will land on a Saturday around lunch time (JFK Terminal 8). My hotel is located next to Fulton St. Station. That's when I am at lost as google maps offers several alternatives train wise with either green or red Air Trains and then 1 to 2 connections.    From Howard Beach Station it looks relatively straightforward with only changing for the A Train to Fulton Street. But how often does the A Train runs? Does it stop at Fulton St over the weekend? I was trying to find out on the MTA website without success.

Two moms and three 14-year-old girls will be in NYC this weekend. It‚Äôs a first-time visit for the teens; moms have only a couple of times. We have a very limited amount of time (Saturday afternoon through late Monday afternoon) and are focused on seeing some sites with a bit of shopping for the girls. Is this doable or does it seem too rushed? Would you recommend any changes?    Saturday ‚Äì Arrive via Amtrak at 12:45 PM; leave the bags at the customer service Kioask; grab a slice of pizza at NY Pizza Suprema. Walk up Broadway to Times Square to Rockefeller Center to 5th Avenue to Central Park. Walk the southernmost section of the park only (basically from the Pond over to Columbus Circle) just so the girls can see a bit of it. Take the subway back to Moynihan Train Station pick up our bags and then take the subway to Sohotel on the corner of Broome and Bowery (we hope to be at the Hotel by 5 PM ‚Äì is that realistic??). Check in freshen up and then take the subway to York St. Station and walk the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan. Dinner in Little Italy (hopefully around 7:30; realistic???). Return to hotel. If this seems like too much we can drop the Brooklyn Bridge walk.    Sunday ‚Äì up early for 9 AM ferry to SOL ‚Äì we have crown tickets. Right now we are planning on skipping Ellis Island because the girls would prefer to shop ‚Äì go figure. Be back at Battery Park hopefully by noon (possible???). Grab something quick to eat. Visit WTC Memorial (we are not going to the museum). From there go to SoHo so the girls can shop a bit. Return to hotel freshen up take subway to Broadway. We have a 5 PM reservation at Toloache then we‚Äôre seeing Wicked. We plan to have cheesecake at Junior‚Äôs after the show then walk down Broadway to Times Square before catching the subway back to the hotel. If this seems like too much we can drop SoHo and do it Monday in place of the High Line and Chelsea Market.    Monday ‚Äì Let the girls sleep a bit. Check out of hotel by 11 AM. Drop bags at Moynihan Station. Then walk to see the Vessel walk the High Line to Chelsea Market for lunch walk back towards the train station to catch the 4:30 train.

Before travelling to NYC I was confused which observatory to climb.    Most people compared between Empire State Building (ESB) and Rockefeller (TOR).  Very few stated about One World Observatory (OWO) or others.    Since ESB was more famous (my wife never heard of TOR) I prebooked ESB. Arrived there 15 mins prior to my time and entry was without much crowd.    The view was good from 86th floor. ESB has 2 floors. The bottom one fully glass enclosed. The top one (takes another elevator) has outside view. It was windy there and bit cold too. The view was good (it was good sunny day).    By this time my daughter said she would fancy another high rise and she mentioned OWO being highest in NYC.    So next day we turned up at OWO without any booking an hour before sunset. But surprised to get tickets ($45 pp) at the kiosk and was allowed immediate entry.    There are 3 floors 101-102. The elevator takes directly to 102th floor then you climb down to lower floors. It was fully enclosed. But the view was spectacular. We had to both pre and post sunset views including night views. At night taking photos were tricky due to light reflecting from glass. The observatory was dimly lit (so that people can take photos) but still EXIT signs and dim lights were reflecting. Some tourists were using rubber funnel caps to their camera lenses stuck to glass to get reflection free pictures.    The Edge building was in front of OWB and it felt so low when viewed from OWB - so no point climbing to that one.    On hindsight I could have saved some money by climbing only one instead of two skyscrappers.    If I have to choose I'd say OWO view was better than ESB. Also OWB does not charge more for sunset times! ,holidzf,New York City,"London, United..."
Hello I'm travelling to the city with my mom (who's 57) this June and we need a place to stay. Sadly hotels are too expensive and hostels are not exactly ideal for my mom. That's why I started searching for other options and someone close to me recommended Sacred Heart Residence. I thought it was ideal but they haven't replied to my email so I searched the web for other religious residences. So far I have found these:  Sacred Heart Residence - http://www.sacredheartresidence.com/  House of the Redeemer - https://www.houseoftheredeemer.org/  Kolping Residence - http://www.kolpingny.org/  Penington Friends House- http://www.penington.org/  Menno House - https://mennohouse.org/  Leo House - https://leohousenyc.com/  Interfaith retreats - https://www.interfaithretreats.com/  Some of them have no availability some haven't replied and other are not exactly what we're looking for though if they're the only option will take them.  Anyways I came here to share what I have found because I went crazy searching for some of them. I also wanted to know if there are other residences similar to these that I haven't seen.  Thank you! ,Victoria,New York City,Buenos Aires...

Hi everyone    I have got my hands on a flight to New York City it is a last-minute trip for the end of next month.  I have been looking and it appears that staying in Newark (due to flight arrival and departure times into Newark airport) is going to be more beneficial for me than Manhttan. However I wanted to check with the experts.  So if I was to stay in Newark and get the train into NYC each day is it as easy and inexpensive as it appears? OR is it more beneficial to stay in Manhattan. Also the dates I am coming coincide with Thanksgiving so I imagine it will be alot busier than usual.  I am wanting to wander NYC take a couple of organised daytrips out of the city perhaps and definitely I am doing the Christmas thing (well what is around I have to leave before the lighting of the tree sadly). ,CeeJaye33,New York City,"Christchurch, New..."

Thought I'd do a quick search on eating out. I'm surprised at the cost of food forgive my ignorance but last time I was there you could buy a coffee and bagel for US$2 in a cart down the road.  Now the prices seem to be about the same as here in NZ except in USD. I thought with the low wages for servers and the lower cost for food etc (comparatively to here) that the cost to eat it would be lower too but I was wrong.

Anyone have any recent experiences at Lombardy? I am contemplating a Manhattan Suite with 1 and a half bathrooms for our family of 4 with teens but not too sure about the area. Hubby really wants to be closer to Hells Kitchen (we have 2 rooms at Romers held at the moment) but the Lombardy looks so lovely and spacious.  I know San Carlos seems to get a lot of good recomondations also but it looks slightly more rundown but if anyone suggests that is better I would also look into it.

Hi all    Going to NYC for 6 nights friday first time for my daughter who turned 4 years old today.    I was surprised not to see more shows good for kids here in Switzerland we also bring her to concerts magic shows etc    Only thing I saw was the gazillion bubble show which she would probably enjoy. Any other show that is mostly for kids?    Regarding normal shows I read a few things here and elsewhere about that it's better not to bring young kids to musicals in broadway especially regarding duration. While my daughter usually is like fascinated and would stay watching often in our arms (she did this sunday during a 90 minutes concert) 2 hours a half seems a bit long . My wife is much more into musicals than I am (I will storngly suggest she goes alone if we don't all go together) so I wouldn't mind leaving before the end if it's too complicated but I don't want to disturb other people.    If we decide to try a musical anyway... is Alladin the only/best option? ,R√©my S,New York City,"Geneva, Switzerland"
Mini-review -  We stayed at the Sheraton Tarrytown again and the room was very comfortable and clean no complaints there. We‚Äôd also stayed at the Sleepy Hollow hotel in the past and that was fine as well except many amenities were missing it not functioning. I believe that stay was shortly after new ownership had come in‚Ä¶  We enjoyed a few pubs in the area including Demeters (roast beef sand w/au jus) Saw Mill Tavern (chicken pot pie) and Mr. Nick‚Äôs (Grandma Pizza). Because Tarrytown was unbelievably busy this year the line at Horsefeathers and other favorite spots were ridiculously long.

Hi all    We're planning a road trip across some East coast states (NY Maine NH VT CT etc) and I understand the whole toll road system is a pain and completely electronic (i mean there are no gates or (e-)stickers).  I see that you can pay by mail (which is not an option as we will have a rental car for like 10 days and otherwise live in Europe) unless I pay it online within 48 hours I entered such toll road (?).    I was wondering if anyone has used the Ecotoll app and if this could be a good solution? I can register even a rental car there and I guess they somehow charge the card as I enter a toll road (by Location info?). It all sounds great but I have difficulty to find real reviews.  Thanks ,Mirax T,,"Warsaw, Poland"

I will be visiting Brooklyn with my son (19) for a day and a half before going on a cruise from Brooklyn. We are staying at the Wyndham Garden Brooklyn Sunset Park. Have any questions:    Is it a safe area to walk?  What is there to see/do on such a short stay that would be walking distance (up to 5km radius) from the hotel? I was thinking of catching a sunset from one of the parks eating at caf√©s and local restaurants going to Industry city visiting the cemetary. Anything else you could recommend?  After the cruise I hear terrible stories about grabbing a cab from the cruise port (because 5500 people are coming off). Our flight back is out of EWR but only in late afternoon so we have some time to explore but will have suitcases... just wondering what the best plan would be upon getting off the ship? Was thinking a ferry ride or walk to somewhere where it would be easier to get a cab or having food in the Red Hook district to wait for the crazy traffic from the port to die down... or head to EWR airport hotel to lounge in the lobby for a few hours until our flight time. What is the best way to get to EWR from there? Any ideas/plan to make disembarkation as smooth and stress free as possible would be great.    Thanks!! ,nadinek75,Brooklyn,

Hello  My mom is taking me to NYC - she wants to see the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree lighten up.  I read crowds gather starting 3 p.m. Who knows what the weather will be and she is not going to be able to stand in line for 6 hours until the actual ceremony.  Asking for a unicorn is there a restaurant or cafe nearby where we could watch the ceremony (other than on TV on NBC). Is it really that crowded to see the ceremony?  after Nov 29th when can we see the tree lit is lit during the day too or only at night ?  Thanks! ,Tour Eiffel t,New York City,"Chicago, Illinois"

Hello! we are coming to NYC for Christmas 2023 and are currently booked to stay centrally in Manhattan.  I‚Äôve seen a number of comments about the novelty of Times Square wearing off after the first day and we do quite like the off the beaten track places when we travel. I‚Äôve seen places to stay in greenpoint which I recognise as being further out but my question is realistically is it too far out? We haven‚Äôt been to NYC before and hope to do many of the ‚Äútouristy‚Äù things. Is it too difficult to get to and from if we stayed in greenpoint? We are fit and plan to do a lot of walking so getting to and from the metro is not a problem but is it simple enough to get from greenpoint into the main buzz of NYC and back especially on and around Christmas Day and later evenings? ,Shannon,New York City,

Me and a friend have a trip planned to NYC at the beginning of November but have been seeing a lot of news about the pesticide-resistant bed bugs starting in Paris coming to other places like the UK and NYC. It's made us a bit nervous since we're about a month out from our trip and really don't want to bring these things back home to the west coast... has anyone been to New York in the past couple of days and heard of any talk of the bed bugs?    Additionally does anyone think that New York would declare a travel advisory about this issue? Obviously it's still very early but not sure what to look out for as we get closer to our trip. ,Nicole W,New York City,

I think every regular reader and most visitors know that I love my city I love Manhattan I love my neighborhood. And I love diversity and varying opinions and multi culturalism and all of the interesting things that come along with all of it.    That said there is a rally near the Stock Exchange tomorrow. The are a lot of concerns about it. My building has hired extra security. The police will be out in full force. My Assembly Member and Congressman are monitoring as well as many NGOs. I suggest (strongly) that if you are planning on visiting the area immediately around the Stock Exchange tomorrow that you plan on getting the he!! out of the area no later than about 2. It will only affect the immediate area right around the Exchange. The Oculus Eataly and 9/11 Memorial will be fine. Statue of Liberty etc will be fine. You won't even know anything is happening in those areas. But Broad Street/Nassau Street Beaver to Pine Street Broadway to William....just don't plan on being in the area tomorrow.    Message me for more details if you want. There are posters advertising it but with the way this forum usually works if I say what it is it will start a fight. So keeping it sterile and focused on travel needs: just be prudent and don't be in the area between 2-7:30 or so it would be foolish. ,Risa L,New York City,"New York City, New..."

Hi all. We‚Äôre just starting out planning a month long USA trip for April in a couple of years (plenty of time for adjustments then bookings). We‚Äôve started out with a massive wish list done a heap of culling and broken the trip into 4 basic segments with roughly a week in each. We could easily spend a whole month in each segment but want try to fit in as much variety and wish list items as we can. Below is an estimated timeline for each segment (which I‚Äôll post in the relevant forums) to see if it sounds completely insane or full on but achievable. I suspect we may still need to do some more culling and we can get more into the nitty gritty of each segment at a later date.  We‚Äôll be 2 families with 2 adults and 3 mid-late teens each. We‚Äôre interested in seeing the scenery and some places of historic or cultural significance. We are from regional Western Australia so good at sitting in a car for a few hours at a time (it‚Äôs a long drive to anywhere) but not so good at standing in lines with 100s of people! We‚Äôre happy to walk/use public transport as much as possible but we are going to need to hire a car a few times too.  East- 10 days/9 nights: Fly in to New York 4 nights (3 full days)  Amtrack to Washington DC on the 5th day 3 nights (2 full days)  Harpers Ferry 2 nights (1 full day) either hire car or Amtrak?  Fly out of DC on 10th day  Mid- 6 days/8 nights: Fly into Chicago 2 night (1 full day)  Amtrak to St Louis 1 night (only partial days)  Flight to Nashville 2 nights (1 and 1/2 days)  Drive to Memphis 3 nights (2 full days)  Grand Canyon (include Las Vegas) ‚Äì 4days/4 nights: Fly to Las Vegas 1 night (to see the lights)  Hire car and drive to Williams 1 night  Drive to Grand Canyon Village via Wupatki NM 2 nights (1 full day at GC)  Drive back to Las Vegas to fly out late arvo  Pacific North West ‚Äì 6 nights: Fly into Seattle 2 nights (1 full day)  Amtrack to Portland 1 night (Hire car) Can we fit in Columbia Gorge this arvo?  Drive Oregon Coast (Astoria ‚Äì Florence) 2 nights (2 locations on coast)  Return to Portland 1 night fly out day  Our international flights from/to Australia will likely arrive/depart SFO and LAX so we‚Äôll also look to add a couple of nights in each of those locations at either end.  Would love to hear your thoughts? ,mudy b,New York City,"Perth, Australia"

We are visiting NYC for the first time. We are a party of 5 (three teenage girls) and have booked Wicked 12/18/23. We are open for a great pizza place and open to a nice sit down experience. Price point around $30-40 a plate. We arrive 12/18 and have a checkin of 3pm. We have time to freshen up and grab dinner before. We are open to eat after if that is a thing to do...We are flexible.  We are also going to see Rockettes on 12/20 at 5 pm. We would love any recommendations for dinner after the show.  Would you recommend Serendipity for dessert ? if not what would you recommend ?

First timers in NYC. Family of 4 (2 adults 2 kids (5 & 9). The Statue of Liberty is the top priority. Read on webpage 3 types of tix: 1) crown access (sold out kids already crying!!!!) 2) pedestal access and 3) grounds. All the same prices.    If I understand it correctly 2) and 3) are identical but #2 is better because includes pedestal access while the rest stays the same which is round ferry trip to Liberty and Ellis Islands. Seems pretty straightforward but since price is the same decided to double check.    Also thinking who knows what kind of weather (Nov.19-23) so would prefer not to book in advance but rather determine once arrived. Or if I wait too long for the pedestal access to book they will be gone as well.    Also what part of the day is better to reserve: AM or PM? Thanks a bunch! ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada

I‚Äôll be in Lake George for a few days in early November with my wife. While she‚Äôs attending the conference that is the reason for our trip I‚Äôd like to do some hiking. I‚Äôll only have time for one hike.  I‚Äôve read stuff about both Buck and Prospect Mountains but the reviews of both are so contradictory I don‚Äôt have a good feel for either. Some people say they‚Äôre moderately challenging others say they‚Äôre a tough slog. Time estimates also vary wildly. Obviously a big part of that comes down to one‚Äôs experience and physical fitness. I do a fair amount of hiking and I think I‚Äôve got good stamina for a 62-year-old but I would appreciate hearing from someone who‚Äôs hiked them both particularly as to how they compare in terms of difficulty and time needed assuming a reasonably steady but moderate pace.

I am contemplating a trip to NYC (yay) Feb 1 to 5 with my adult daughter. There is a music festival in Jersey City that she would be attending and I will ask on their forum about specifics relative there but from the NYC side crew I am wondering‚Ä¶    1. Is the idea of arriving in JFK and staying at a hotel in Jersey City just plain foolish? It makes hundreds of dollars difference in savings for us to fly to JFK vs EWR this time that‚Äôs why it is worth consideration. How to travel between the two? Our flight would arrive at Terminal 4 at about 4:15 and we would have pre-cleared already.  2. Hotel choice in Jersey City might be the Canopy by Hilton a 4 min walk from the Grove St PATH station and we would travel into Manhattan each day and she (or both of us) would head back to Jersey City for the evening. I like the idea of her being close to the hotel after the concert ends and not having to navigate on her own back to Manhattan late at night. Having said that our hotel choice in Manhattan would likely be the Hotel Indigo Financial District at Trinity and Rector so it would not too much further to travel. Should mention that she can be ‚Äúdirectionally challenged‚Äù though! Any thoughts on this?    Thanks for your help. I will ask some questions on the Jersey City forum too depending on how this looks in general. ,mcwhippet,New York City,"Edmonton, Canada"

I‚Äôm travelling to NY in December and we‚Äôre hoping to do the Top of the Rock viewpoint for sunset.    I‚Äôve seen the sunset is around 16:30 - so what time would be best to book tickets to account for queuing etc. and get to the top in time to watch as the sun goes down (hopefully weather permitting!)    Thanks so much :) ,Jade,New York City,United Kingdom

What do any locals recommend as their favourite Bagel toppings to have whilst in Manhattan? Or just favourite Bagel combos in general....  Heading there in November and looking for inspiration!

We are a group of 12 (4 kids) travelling to New York the week before Christmas. Does anyone recommend a private transfer for all of us? ,Megan,New York City,
Today a took a day trip to Kingston NY. Kingston was the first capital of NY until it was burned to the ground by the British in 1777 during the revolutionary war. Some might know of it because on the NY thruway there is a sign New York City 100 (Miles) by the Kingston Exit    I drove to Kingston There is a bus there fro the Port Authority and you can also take Amtrak to Rhinecliff (Rhinebeck) and take a Taxi/Uber across the Hudson to Kingston. It took me about 2 hours from Queens to get there    There are 2 main areas of interest in Kingston the Historic/Downtown District and the Waterfront District    My first stop was the State Senate Museum The first New York State Senate Met here in 1777 for about 6 weeks until the British burned down Kingston and the Capital was moved to Albany. NYC was occupied by the British and was not able to be the capital and thats the reason NYC is not the capital of NY Albany is. The House and museum were closed when I got there at 10 as it opened at 1pm However I am going to jump to 2 pm as I went back here to visit and take the tour The Tour of the Senate House was amazing The Senate Building is the oldest contiuous House opened to the Public in the US the house dates from 1656 (There are some oldest buildings in NYC but there werent always opened to the Public) the tour of the house takes about and hour and is very interesting to History and revolutionary war Buffs    (Now back to 10:30am)    Beause the Senate house was close I walked to the downtown Kingston Area some really nice and old buildigns here. I then went to the Old Dutch church which dates from 1852 however the graveyard contains revolutionary war graves    My next stop was the Van Streenburgh house I could have walked the 1/2 mile but I drove this privately owned house was the only building to survive the 1777 Burning of Kingston by the British    I then drove to the waterfront there waterfront was interesting. Kingston has this Hipster vibe sort of like Greenpoint or Long Island City    There is a maritime Museum here and boat rides are offered on the Hudson from here    I wanted to go the New York Trolley Museum This place open on weekends is a museum and offeres trolley rides.    Here are photos    https://imgur.com/gallery/rFvzYXV ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City

My daughter is at the Fashion Insitute and spending an insane amount of money on extra food (on top of the school meal plan - she's vegan so they don't have everything she needs plus she stays p beyond dining hall hours to work; that Fashion Design program is no joke!).

Are there any Aladdin promo codes for the week of Thanksgiving? The tickets I was looking at is now gone. Mad I didn‚Äôt buy them when I first looked. ,NOLA_4Life,New York City,New Orleans...
Good day to this wonderful community! We are a family of 4 (2 adults) and 2 kids (6 & 9 y/o). Never been to New York have special milestone to celebrate and would like to do it in NYC. Our special occasion is on Nov.23 (your Thanksgiving) and will be planning to book a nice restaurant with the view and morning will go to the Parade. Thinking about staying for up to a week either leading to 23rd or following or in between depending on prices/weather wise. Didn‚Äôt book anything and would like to do it this week.    Planning on doing major city attractions: boat ride (Statue of Liberty) Central Park (perhaps by horse driven carriage since kids won‚Äôt manage to walk far) doing one of the views (Empire State Building or Summit One Vanderbilt or Edge or Top of the Rock or One World Observatory). Perhaps Helicopter ride to see Skyline but highly doubt. Lots of walking: St.Patrick Cathedral Rockefeller Centre Time Square Bryant Park NY Public Library Grand Central Terminal Chrysler Building The Vessel Brooklyn Bridge Wall Street 9/11 Memorial the Oculus.    I am pretty clueless where to stay. I can imagine hotel prices in these central locations will be through the roof so perhaps staying close by is out of question. I am one of those where location matter most then the actual hotel level rating does matter though. I think the budget would be up to $300 for a decent hotel in the area that would be easily commutable to these central points of interest? Is that realistic? Or not really? What areas would you recommend looking at? Perhaps within 30 min commute distance as max?    I did see some decent ones in Manhattan area or Brooklyn. Please give me any ideas so I can start looking to price it out. ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada
We are visiting New York for 7 nights and are wanting to look at taking a day out of the city using the train. Was thinking max 2 hours each way it will be mid November so would probably not be looking at coastal beaches etc. There are 4 adults and we are looking for a Main Street with shopping cafes and maybe a museum/activity. I have seen Woodstock but would be happy if anyone has any other suggestions. We would very much appreciate any suggestions. ,familyworrall,New York City,"Doncaster, United..."

How are the rides there? is it just going to be mostly close? will our trip there will just be wasted or is there any other option somewhere around NYC besides six flags  We are willing to travel with car even 100-200 miles away is fine (but probably not more than that tho)    thanks..... ,TheSunisWarm,New York City,"Columbus, Ohio"

Hi everyone  I‚Äôm visiting New York on the 1st of November till the 5th.  Is it normal that I‚Äôm not getting anything for less than 1500 usd? The night cost 400 usd?

Hi everyone!  I'm coming to New York next month and will be staying in Williamsburg. I will arrive at JFK but my flight back home will depart from EWR so I'm wondering what's the best way to go to Newark from Brooklyn on a Sunday afternoon (flight is departing at 6.50 PM).  Taxi? Uber? Always stayed in Manhattan on my trips to NYC so I really don't know what to do this time..  TYSM! ,BR1,New York City,"Rimini, Italy"

I'm at the airport awaiting my turn for a chair massage so thought I would write a report of our quick trip to NYC. I love reading others reports so wanted to provide some insight into our time.    We arrived at LGA mid-morning on Friday. We have only been to LGA one other time and we didn't have good memories as it was under renovation then so were pleasantly surprised when ariving---what a great airport!! We found it to be nice modern and really clean. Really great! We hopped in a yellow cab--- the driver was terrible as he cursed the whole time and wanted to rant about politics. He also made comments about the personal appearance of people on the street-- we couldn't get out of his cab fast enough!!    We staying at Conrad Midtown in a Park View room....what a great room and hotel. Highly recommend for size of room location of hotel and service. We would stay there again in a heartbeat-- close to subway and a short walk to so many places!! They were able to get us into a room straight away so we were able to get settled and head out for adventure!    We walked over to Central Park and had a bite at Tavern on the Green. It was rainy but we didn't let that stop us. The reason for our trip was the Billy Joel concert at MSG on Friday night. We had reservations for dinner at Nick & Stef's right at the Garden. It was really quite good and they had a door to go upstairs where we didn't have to go outside. Would recommend! Billy Joel was spectacular! This is the 6th time we've seen him but first time in The Garden. It was everything I dreamed it would be and I got a little teary a couple of times. Subway to and from were painless. It was a great travel day and fist night.    Saturday we got early pastries delivered via room service and then headed to Chelsea Piers for a brunch cruise with Classic Harbor Line Tours. This was AMAZING! They use these awesome old restored boats. It was a fall foilage cruise up the Hudson. I was worried because it was rainy but we saw some great views! The roof and sides are all glass. The staff was great and the food was really yummy!! We left stuffed and happy. Really a highlight and we would use them again! We then dashed to check out the Peloton studios because I'm an addict :) We stopped in Macy's on 34th for a moment and then found a sidewalk Cafe for a snack. We had dinner at Bacall's (meh) and saw Hamilton. We loved our seats and had a great time but that bathroom situation at intermission needs addressing!! I actually felt unsafe in the lobby with everyone in there. We would hesitate to return to this theater because of this. Seriously flawed!    Sunday we had breakfast at Carnagie diner and then went to Central Park for a Central Park Conservancy Walking tour. We wouldn't recommend this.... the guide was nice and we saw part of the park but it wasn't our cup of tea. The history was more in depth than we would enjoy....this is an us problem and not a them' problem but we would prefer something less in depth and see more things. We then went to the Top of the Rock. Loved that! We had the Express Pass and would absolutely recommend that as we passed by many a line with that magic pass! We have done Emprire State Building before and prefer this one.    That's it....headed home. We wont take the bus all the wsy to LGA again....not a chance but love public transportation otherwise. We like a quick trip leaving plenty to do another time. We need to visit in warmer weather.    Thanks to all for your help with my questions and others as I researched! ,bigmacfan,New York City,Saint Charles...
I have only been to New York 3 times all in Times Square during December. I'm interested in seeing Central Park and The Statue Of Liberty during a warmer time of year. I do not know geography very well and would like to know best area to stay to be able to see both on a very short trip. Prefer not to stay in Time Square but if that's the best location I could live with that.    Thank you so much ,rocco329,New York City,"Lenexa, Kansas"

Please could anyone advise me which things I *must* pre-book to avoid disappointment and how far in advance I should do so?    I‚Äôm interested in the following:    - Ice skating either at the Rockefeller or Central Park    - Summit one or Top of the rock (one or both not decided yet also worried about prebooking due to weather)    - Dyker heights Christmas tour    - 9/11 museum    - Natural history museum    I guess I will also need to book restaurants in advance?    I did consider Statue of Liberty but looks like the tickets to go up into the crown are sold out and to be honest it‚Äôs not really the top of my list of things to do. Do you prebook the ferry to see the SOL? Maybe it‚Äôs worth it to just get the free ferry and have a view of it rather than go up?

My boyfriend and I are arriving at 17.00 on a saturday night in december and departing at 08.30 on sunday.  So I am guess out of airport by 19.00 & back at 06.00 to recheck in our luggage.    This might be unpopular but I have seen NYC before on a proper visit & as we have such short time & a limited budget I'm not bothered about going into Manhattan. My boyfriend has never been to the USA so this is what we ideally want    *4-5hours of sleep in a bed  *Food at a typically american place like Applebees / Chillis or fast food like chick-fil-a something tacky like that.  *To visit a Wallmart - or Target or something to buy american candy and stuff.  * not spend too much money    Can anyone suggest how best to tick these boxes? (thanks in advance)    Please don't comment if you are just going to say i should go to proper restaurants or see a tourist attraction.  We will have just finished a long trip and this is what we want to do- my boyfriend watches lots of american show so just to go into a k-mart or eat at a wendys will be super fun for him. ,CocktailPrincessB52,New York City,"Battle, United..."
First timers in NYC. Family of 4 (2 adults 2 kids (5 & 9). Researched observation decks‚Ä¶ Will go only to one but want to ensure that we pick the best‚Ä¶.. if you could help with your comments to sway the needle into one or another direction I would really appreciate as I am very bad with making a decision when it comes to choices‚Ä¶. Sorry‚Ä¶    Empire State Building: would be remiss to leave NYC without checking it out BUT the net in front of your eyes is taking away also the view itself seems less busy than others?    Summit One Vanderbilt seems like a very cool interactive experience for kids so no brainer is there any trade off with views here?    The Edge seems very cool too    Top of the Rock seems like a rooftop with open view which is nice    One World Observatory the view is very distant seems like would be the last place ,InfinitSilver,New York City,Canada

Hello    I have been given some advice regarding NYE and have booked tickets for where we wanted to go but was wondering if anyone could offer any advice on visiting the SOL.  To best fit the itinerary I‚Äôm planning we would ideally go during the day on NYE as early as possible.    Do you think it‚Äôs feasible to do the SOL and be back to our hotel in Bryant park by about 6pm (maybe include early dinner in there)  Then get ready to go out for the NYE event which is within the frozen zone we can arrive between 9-10.30.  We were advised on here to walk down 5th ave to wherever the frozen bit ends across then up 8th ave to 51st street.    But I have no idea how long to allow to navigate the crowds and this route on NYE.    Don‚Äôt mind cramming it all into one day/night even though it will be full on but no idea if I am being unrealistic.    Thanks for any help offered ,LC4308,New York City,"Leicester, England..."

Thanks for all the help on TA and brief trip report which may be of help    Spent 4 days in New York as family of 5. Arrived into Newark and got large cab at the taxi line (they radioed for large cab for 5 with 5x luggage and only had to wait about 5 mins). Set fare $77 plus tolls and tip which cost c$123 in total. Took about an hour to get to hotel.  Stayed in Best Western Hospitality House on 49th and Lexington - no frills hotel but was like 2 bed apt with 1 bathroom and included breakfast. As we were late we walked down to Times Square (about 25min walk) and ate in Juniors and got cheesecake - it was average and not as good as I remember. Walked around Time Sq / all the bright lights and so busy. We then headed down by Rockafella Centre and down to Grand Central station for a look and took some photos.    Day 2 : breakfast at hotel . I had booked pedestal tickets for Statue of Liberty in advance / got subway from Grand central. Bought 2 metro cards at machine (Max people that can use 1 card is 4) we loaded them up by credit card. I think it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨2.75 per fare) It would not accept Revolut card so used Visa card - tip for EU visitors - when asked for zip code put in 99999)    took about 20 mins to get to departure point - I had mobile tickets which they scanned and were got on boat around 9.30am. (Which was earlier than our scheduled time of 10am) Busy but not to crowded. It was an amazing trip and got great photos - ate in cafe on Liberty island  didn‚Äôt have enough time to do Ellis .  We then went to see charging bull - teens got pics as it is all over tic tock. We then walked around One World and ground Zero and reflecting pools. We also went to the Oculus and took pics. There were street food vendors here and we had delicious Philly Cheese Steaks .  We then got subway to Chelsea and walked around the market / it‚Äôs fab but we weren‚Äôt hungry at that stage so went for iced coffees to the large Starbucks Roastary. We then walked the Highline to Hudson Yards - a lovely walk. We hadn‚Äôt realised the Vessel was closed . We got subway back to hotel to have a rest and later went out for pizza - great day covering about 30000 steps!    Day 3:Next day teens wanted to go shopping so after breakfast at hotel we walked to Penn Station and got bus to outlets in Jersey Gardens which opened at 10am - (30 min trip)some good bargains Got back to hotel around 2pm We went out at 4pm to do Roosevelt tramway which was near our hotel but it was so packed and looked uncomfortable. They were packing people on so we skipped that and got subway to Brooklyn bridge - again this was packed so we decided we would walk it the next morning . We wandered around seaport district and ended up back at ShakeShack at Oculus as we were starving at this point/ it was good. Subway back to Hotel.  We booked in advance Summit one Vanderbilt for 9pm. This was highlight for teens. Very interactive and great views (it was booked out prev 2 nights so make sure to prebook)    Day 3: up early and subway to Brooklyn Bridge stop for 9am. It was so much quieter. Street traders were only setting up and we bought caps and souvenirs. Got great photos on bridge as not busy. In Brooklyn got photos at Dumbo and then went to Time Out Market to Ety Bagel (I think) left there about 11am and it was getting busy. Got train from Brooklyn to Central Park / around 84th st so walked at least half the park. Grabbed hot dogs at Boathouse from Street vendor and some delicious fruit. Strolled down 5th Ave popping into Apple store and FAO Swartz and then back to Hotel. That evening we then went to Ellen‚Äôs Stardust Diner. Queue about 1 hr but well worth the wait - we got table downstairs and all loved the atmosphere the singing and food was delicious. We were party of 5 but they were taking smaller groups out of the queue as tables became available so smaller groups don‚Äôt have as long a wait. Outside teens bought some fake handbags from street traders after some bargaining from initial price asked.    Last day: after breakfast wandered down to Empire State Building and went to Sephora Ulta and Target for makeup for Girls. My son stocked up on the drink ‚ÄòPrime‚Äô at Vitamin shop. Only $2.99 or could get box of sachets - very hard to get in Ireland and if you can it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨15 per bottle so he was thrilled. Walked by Macy‚Äôs but no time to go in as had to check out - hotel took our bags do we got subway back down to Oculus and went to Eataly for lunch (which I pre booked thankfully as was super busy) food was delicious and we all loved it. Got subway back to Time Sq and went to M&M store and got more souvenirs before walking back to Hotel. Ordered Uber XL for airport and headed back to Newark. Fare more expensive going back. About $155 incl tolls and tip.  It was an amazing trip which we all enjoyed and racked up the steps - which helped with all the calories consumed / can‚Äôt wait to come back ,bebecailin,New York City,ireland
Hi. Travelling to the city from London with my artist partner where we are looking to visit all the art galleries & museums in NY. We will get a room probably around Central Park or Times Sq for 8-9 nights. Approx ¬£200 per night which I guess is at the lowest end at a 3 star accommodation  Questions please  1. Do I need to book any of these pieces before I visit ? Talking about the Art Galleries & Museums  2. Will do the usual tourist sights. I‚Äôve been 20+ years ago So not do big a deal but it‚Äôs my partners 1st time. So we will do the usual tourist sites. Again do I book these before arriving ?  3. I have heard about local guides you can use for the day to show you around NYC ? Are these personal guides still around ? Seen a few accompanying tours with guides at $100-$120 pp. are these any good. ? Or easier to use a local guide for the day ?    Any help & advice Will be greatly appreciated  Thank you. ,Chapel715,New York City,"Leeds, United..."

Hi    We are in NYC end Oct with our teenage sons and have Renaissance Chelsea booked. I‚Äôm a little concerned about some of the reviews and wondered if you all could help?

I‚Äôve read somewhere hotel guests can‚Äôt use the rooftop bar is this true?    I had a quick look at other options. Would the Moxy East Village be a better option?

Hi  Looking forward to a trip back to NYC next year. Can anyone recommend some good old fashioned diners for breakfast the type where you would see people like the NYPD would go to grab something to eat.

Hello!! I appreciate any help as this is the first time trip for us. My husband and I plus for teenagers. We are willing to stay outside of Manhattan as long as it's relatively quick & easy to get to. A friend recommended we stay in Newark nr Penn St. Thoughts in that? Most hotels only accommodate 4 ppl. So we were looking for a suite if possible. Other issue is that we will have a car since we are driving from western PA. What the heck do we do with our car?! ,Eileen L,New York City,
I'm sure this has been asked many times before but we travel to NYC for a few days over new year. The organised family parties at places like Dallas BBQ seem so expensive but more importantly I dont think my 2 children will want to sit in one place for 5 or 6 hours. What would the advice be please with two children age 12 and 10. I have no desire to see the ball drop just a nice restaurant followed y some entertainment and even a distant look at fireworks would be great.

Not planning any observatories due to the height. Does this seem like a logical plan? We are staying near Times Square. Is there anything we have missed that would be a ‚Äòmust do‚Äô?

Hello everybody!  I need your help for the following:  Our family of 5 has tickets reserved for Applebee's on 50th Street for New Year's Eve (as it is one of the few events open to those under 21). We will be staying at the Riu Plaza Manhattan Times Square hotel on the 47th St.  My question is: since both the restaurant and hotel are located in the Frozen Zone will the NYPD let us pass directly through Times Square if we show proof of the event? And if not what is the best walking route to get there? We have also considered changing hotels to one that I s closer to Applebee's ... if so what is the best option?  Thanks in advance. ,eniviv,New York City,Portugal
I am planning a cruise in December and will arrive in NYC on a flight the day the cruise leaves. Wondering which airport would be better to land in terms of traffic or getting a taxi in the event that we are running late and need to make it quick to the cruise terminal.

Hey Folks  Just wondering if any locals can help out - Going to a concert at Kings Theatre in Flabush Ave Brooklyn end of November.  Any recommendations on getting to and from 42nd Street station Times square - I know the Q train runs from there to Beverly Road station - Would this be best option? We will probably have food near our hotel near times square and then hope to arrive at Kings Theatre for around 8.30pm/9pm.  Thanks for your help.  Cheers  Justin üòé ,JussyMucky,New York City,
Hi all  lending at 3.45 in terminal 4 flying from Geneva friday with my wife and our 4 years old daughter then going to our hotel sheraton in NYC. Probably with one big suitcase for both adults a smaller one for our daughter and probably a stroller (that is small when folded we usually don't use it anymore but as we expect to walk a lot in nyc it'll be needed).    What are your recommandations for travelling to the hotel with that setup?    I travelled often to NYC so I'm used to take the subway. I was expecting to take a taxi to be much easier with a young kid and luggage but is it really a good idea with traffic jam at about 4-5 pm?    I also realized that the E train from Jamaica stops at the door of our hotel (actually chose it because of that convenient subway stop without realizing it was going there!) so as one of my reason was avoiding the metro stairs when changing train or at penn station etc is actually not much of an issue. It's also about 20$ vs 100 which is nice. Could it be the best option? ,R√©my S,New York City,"Geneva, Switzerland"
H ello- visiting your city for just one night this time for a quick trip to collect some airline miles. Been here a few times before this one is kind of last minute.    It‚Äôs 2 of us mostly looking to just eat and walk around in Manhattan. Hotels are so expensive right now so wondering if you all have any suggestions for a creative search - (like New Jersey or white plains etc ? )We‚Äôd prefer something with good connectivity via train safe neighborhood and most importantly cleanliness. We‚Äôll be there Oct 21-22nd 2023. Price range preferably under $250 but can stretch if needed.  If you have any food or bakery suggestions do drop those! Can‚Äôt wait for bibble and sip!! ,RiaMia,New York City,"Seattle, Washington"
Greetings from Melbourne    I'm planning my New York trip mid December and how best to get into our midtown hotel (near W46th and 8th) from Newark.    We were planning on catching the air train from Newark to Penn Station we're just not sure about the last leg. None of it looks easy:  - Walk - approx 15 minutes is a long way with luggage especially if weather is unpleasant  - Taxi - from other posts here I gather this will take forever due to holiday season traffic  - Subway - again luggage!    To weigh up our options it would be helpful to get some advice on using the subway in this situation. I've never been to NYC so don't know what to expect in terms of how mobility-friendly the stations are. Will I get through the turnstyles are there lots of stairs?    Can anyone recommend a subway route that would be easy enough with a large and heavy suitcase plus a couple of smaller items each?    Or is walking/taxi not so bad?    Thank you! ,Claire M,New York City,

I'm staying near Queens Center Mall. Is there a local breakfast (or decent cheap lunch deli/pizza sit down) place that is NOT too pricey where the locals eat? I can go to Jackson Heights if need be but looking mostly for a walking distance neighborhood type place (near elmhurst) even if its take-out only but would prefer it to have a table or two inside or out. Looking for good quality and location mostly even if it's pricey. Somewhere between laguardia and elmhurst near a transit stop would be good or near any transit stop. ,8travelers,Queens,cleveland
Hello! Very lucky to have been to NYC many times before since daughter is a sophomore at FIT! Spontaneously scheduled a quick trip for her birthday present though and could use some input as it will be a whirlwind weekend cramming in two of her biggest desires!    The agenda: I will arrive on Saturday February 10th. No real plans that day...I hesitate to book anything because of weather. We will likely grab show tickets or comedy...or something else spontaneous. We will probably do a nicer dinner that evening. Sunday is where the real fun is! I purchased 3:00 tickets for Merrily We Roll Along and 8:00 tickets for Seth Meyers at the Beacon Theater. (She LOVES LOVES LOVES both...it will be the best day for her!) I know the show runs about 2.5 hours.    Questions:  1. I'd like to find a place for dinner near the Beacon Theater that takes reservations. We are both open to diverse food...really anything goes! We love Italian Thai Mexican...open to others! Casual preferred budget under $100 total?    2. Hotel suggestions? I'd like to keep that cost low. Room size doesn't really matter as it will more than likely be just me and I love NYC so much I'm usually never in it! I currently have Hilton Garden Inn New York/Central Park South-Midtown West scheduled at $381 for both nights but I'd be open to suggestions that are less expensive or closer to the theater.    Thank you for any suggestions! It will be an epic day barring any snowstorms! :) ,andie717,New York City,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"
Hello we are a family of 5-3teenage girls. We need a little more room than these little rooms I have been seeing online. Would you recommend vrbo instead?    We are also trying to decide on shows.

Hey guys  Received some good advice from you guys a while back and since then we have had to extend to a full week in NYC 2-10 April (and I am not complaining :)..our Aussie dollar keeps heading south and we have to be a little more realistic in terms of a budget as we are getting 2 x rooms and this is part of a much longer trip.  My last reservations held are now cancelled( I have lost the previous deals book by changing dates) so I have now booked Romers Hells Kitchen direct with hotel and Arlo midtown on a booking site. Can't find any good deals around that time but are still open to changing if I do.  Does anyone have any feedback on Romers as there does not seem much written about it. We are also considering Kimpton Theta but that does come in a bit more. Does anyone thinks its well worth the extra money? The kids want Time Square hubby wants west side... I think he would prefer to be further down town but considering how many options are around .it is slim pickings with the dollar conversion and this has been a hard trip to plan.  Teens love the usual teen stuff and hubby and I want good food and good bars! Is Romers area suitable? Thanks    Thank you ,Night,New York City,

We thought it would be nice to head up the Hudson on Metro North from Grand Central next week- looking for a station not too far north which has an easy walk from the station to town hopefully a place with a nice stroll through town and a look at the river- fall foliage would be a plus.    I have read about Cold Spring but would not mind somewhere even closer! Hastings-on-Hudson? Peekskill? Tarrytown? Any other suggestions? I notice some trains to Tarrytown have no stops which sounds very attractive! ,bluewaterNB,New York City,Los Angeles...
Hello    I‚Äôm off to New York for the first time and have a few questions I can‚Äôt seem to answer we are staying in Midtown and arrive at JFK being based in mid town it appears the subway would be the best form of transport. Am I required to have some sort of Oyster card to pay journeys and if so will it cover my trip from JFK to Times Square Hotel.    The tipping culture is very foreign to me do you tip when there is also a service charge. Do I always tip even for a drink?    Can you suggest a sport bar my wife and I can visit to take in a game?    Any suggestions on a decent Jazz or Blues bar near midtown.    Apart from the usual tourist things normally listed is there anything you would say to do or any tips for places to go or food. We have most of our ideas planned out but if there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs catches our eye it would be good to know!!    Thanks ,Antman989,New York City,"London, United..."

I have been keeping Waze on while taking trips and noticed something. Cab drivers tend to select routes that take longer. Example today we left the MET at 5 pm to go to One World. FDR showed 30 minutes on Waze but the cab driver selected to go to West St. On the way back to Courtyard Marriott by Central Park the cab driver went to FDR whereas Waze was clear for West st. I tried downloading the app for yellow cabs but it requires a US number which we don‚Äôt have. Is Waze unreliable in NYC ?

Currently planning a trip to New York City for the beginning of this December for around 4 nights myself and my husband. I‚Äôm a bit stuck with which area of the city would be best to stay in.    I‚Äôve so far looked at the Arlo chain of hotels (Arlo Nomad Arlo Soho) but think the rooms might be very small. I‚Äôm leaning towards Riu Plaza New York Times Square hotel and saw there‚Äôs also Riu MANHATTAN plaza Times Square hotel - what is the difference between the two? Are they as good as each other?    Has anybody stayed at Riu Plaza Times Square and can comment on whether you can hear a lot of noise from inside the bedrooms?    On one hand I think it could be nicer to stay in a different neighbourhood and get a more authentic feel of New York (stay in Brooklyn? Chelsea? I have no idea) but I‚Äôm also aware that most of the main tourist sights I want to visit are near Riu plaza Times Square hotel (we want to do Times Square Central Park Empire State Building or another observation tower ice skating at rockerfeller centre Brooklyn bridge dyker heights) so May be easier to be based here especially as it‚Äôs only 4 nights. If I stayed elsewhere eg. Brooklyn would it be a long journey every time we wanted to visit the sights mentioned above?    Lastly does anyone have any recommendations of other hotels that would be close for visiting the places I want to visit a modern hotel and in the price range of Riu hotels/Arlo? Thanks in advance! ,wanderlust,New York City,"Cotswolds, United..."

Great trip so far.    Decided to switch things up and stay at Virgin NoMad instead of William Vale. Good choice. The rooms are good size by Manhattan standards are laid out very well the room I am in has a direct view of the ESB (as does the 3rd floor restaurant) decent gym with TechnoGym equipment and offers live jazz on Tuesday and Thursday early evenings. Great location with close proximity to LIRR Flatiron Chelsea and elsewhere.    Monday evening met up with a friend at Ritz Carlton and had dinner at Zaytinya followed by a drink at Nubeluz‚Äîgreat rooftop bar with 270 degree views of the NYC skyline from their outdoor patios. Very classy place.    Yesterday I walked 11.8 miles heading up to Breitling at 56 and Madison a stop at the NY Public Library (including the ‚ÄúJohn Wick‚Äù room) met a friend at L‚ÄôExpress for a light lunch headed to Minetta Tavern for dinner for the obligatory Black Label Burger then back to my hotel to catch the end of the performing jazz trio.    Today I will head towards Meatpacking District I understand there is a new Gansevoort Beach (?) and maybe lunch in Chinatown.

Hello    we are arriving at JFK at 3:25 PM so after immigration I hope we are out around 4:30 PM. What is the most convenient way to go to midtown for 2 people with 2 big luggage and 2 carry on?  What is an average fare for taxi and Uber/Lyft/Revel?  I've tried to take a look but it seems very confusing with all the adds on after the fixed fare.    Thanks! ,Andrea R,New York City,"Espoo, Finland"
Hi there  What is best way to get from JFK to a hotel in Midtown (near Flatiron Building) on a Saturday early afternoon (this weekend tbh)? Will have 1x big bag but I can carry it easily on public transport.  Is as cab slow and expensive?  Is Public transport slow and unpredictable?  Hit me with your thoughts!  Thanks ,SpiceTraveller,New York City,
Just wondering the best option for paying for subway. There will be 3 of us (2 adults  1 tween) for 4 days. We plan to use the subway to get to attractions. I was thinking of buying the metro unlimited card. Do I need to buy 3 of them or can I swipe 3 people at once? Sorry.. might be a dumb question but the sites aren‚Äôt clear about this.. ,Mary F,New York City,Cork
We are booked for next year to fly into Newark Liberty from the UK. We are a bit confused by the Newark AIR TRAIN website. Could someone please help by explaining what the cost of this is currently per person ( is it $8.25 PLUS about $15 ?? ) and is it a one train only trip from Newark air terminal ? We'll have two suitcases which are pretty easy to carry for us so won't be an issue. Our hotel in NYC is a 5 minute walk from Penn Station so all good there too. Any advice would be most welcome please. Thankyou. ,Brian E,New York City,"Billericay, United..."

Me and my partner have booked flights from the UK to NYC for August 2024. Currently we are looking at hotels across a number of hotel booking websites (e.g. booking.com trivago etc) and there are some hotels which offer the option for 'pay at hotel' instead of paying it all upfront which has to be paid in the hotel's currency (US Dollars).    Due to the cost of this trip we'd ideally want to pick this option as we need some time to save money (NYC is not cheap!) after just paying for the flights but we are a little concerned as to whether this could incur hidden fees or costs when we arrive.    For example I've heard about city taxes and hotel taxes in some places. In addition there's the currency rates which are always changing and I'm not sure whether we could end up paying more.    Has anyone used this option before? Is it something to avoid and did you encounter extra costs you weren't previously aware of when you turned up and paid for the hotel?    Thanks :) ,Toby,,"London, United..."

Please bear with me - I think I know the answer to this but when I tried to look up my specific question on the forum I came up still a bit unsure.    We plan to use contactless on the subway for our next NYC visit and I know Omny caps out at 7 days. But we'll only be there for three to four days. Is there also a daily cap? ( Having just returned from London and two weeks of using the Tube - where there is also a daily cap in addition to the weekly one - I think I still have it all a bit scrambled in my brain.)    Also my family will all be using credit cards attached to the same account but with different numbers and all in our Google wallets. From my understanding of contactless and how a synthetic card number is created for each use we should have no problems using those cards from the same account correct?    TIA! ,scraphappylady,New York City,Philadelphia...

Our cruise ends on 6th December 2023. We have 2 nights but only one full day in New York to cram as much in as possible before our cruise.    We will be leaving the cruise ship approximately 9am and fly from JFK at 8pm the same day. Obviously we don‚Äôt want to go straight from the ship to the airport at that time so are looking for some suggestions as to what we can do for the day whilst dragging our suitcases and hand luggage with us‚Ä¶  The cruise company offer a bus tour with airport drop off for ¬£180 each which seems expensive seeing as we already have airport transfers included in our package.  Would it be cheaper to hire a car and driver for the a few hours? Or is it possible to go to JFK in the morning drop our cases then get a cab back to Manhattan?

Hi all    Myself and my 13 and 15 year old will be in NY this Saturday. Checking the weather forecast and it's looking like rain. My son is not keen on a museum but I'm thinking that might be the best option.    I was looking at a few museum websites and puzzled by the pricing. Most of them ( apart from MOMA) don't consider my kids to be children but at the same time they aren't adults. Some reference college/schools but seem to require a valid ID. I'm not sure about America but in the UK our schoolkids don't have a school ID.  I'm assuming that I won't have to pay the hefty adult prices for them? What have others done?

Forgive me I'm new to travel and I'm lost with what to do here. I'm kind of cash strapped I really want to go to NYC but all the hotels I've found cost $250 a night at a bare minimum with the total costs going 1100+.    This seems like a pretty steep price for just 3 nights staying. The stories I hear of people supposedly traveling for months on end seem crazy even if not everywhere is quite this expensive.    Any advice? Or am I just in over my head and skip NYC and travel elsewhere till I can actually afford it? ,A A,New York City,
We are going to the AMNH on Friday. We are looking for lunch options nearby that could accommodate a party of 9. Nothing too fancy but would maybe like a place where we can all sit together and relax after walking to/from/in the museum. How easy is it to get back into the museum after leaving? I think the line can be pretty long getting in but maybe re-entry is easier? If it‚Äôs too difficult then maybe the Gilder restaurant inside the museum would be best but it doesn‚Äôt have great reviews. ,metcarl,New York City,"Louisville, Kentucky"

We will have around 2 weeks and would like to see some of Upstate NY including Watkins Glen Letchworth State Park and Ithaca NY.    We will be traveling round trip from Nashville TN so are trying to figure out how much time we need to allow for the above areas. We are only able to do hikes of 2-3 miles round trip so how much can we see with these parameters.    We had originally planned to include Lake Placid but I'm not sure if we would have enough time without being too rushed.    We try to limit our drives to under 8 hrs a day. We love small towns and beautiful scenery going at a slow pace.    I would love to hear your advice and any other stops we should include. ,jlouky52,,"Brentwood, Tennessee"
We made a quick decision to do a weekend in Buffalo next weekend who knew most hotels downtown would either be sold out or close to $1000/night. Our alternative (and due to our Hyatt loyalty) is to stay in Amherst. We ideally wanted to be near all of the action/bars/restaurants of downtown but I suppose we can drive in or uber? We haven't been there before so I am wondering advice on whether or not it is REALLY worth it to pay more to get a hotel room downtown? ,Nancy H,Buffalo,

Hello  I need help figuring out the name of a car wash we stopped at last year it was pretty close to the Albany Airport entrance off of 87. It was self serve you drove up to one of maybe 3 or 4 bays and paid at the kiosk. No employees were on site. Then you pulled the car in and the doors shut and the car wash machine went up and around the car while it was parked. No wheel track to drive car on you just pull car in to the bay. It took about 5 mins to complete the wash.  Thanks for the help! ,ssj3,Albany,new jersey

Hello    We are four college friends living across US decided to meet for the weekend in NYC after 9 long years. But we will have less than 24hrs. We land in JFK Oct 28th around 9-10 am and return is on Oct 29th 6.30am flight (we have departures varying from 6.30 to 8 so we will all checkout same time Sunday morning 29th). We have all been to NYC atleast once before.    1. We are considering staying close to JFK since we all have early departure. We aren't looking for budget but not very expensive stay too. Is it a good idea to stay close to JFK or somewhere else in the city.    2. Since we are spending less than 24hrs in the city what can we do on Saturday. We as a group aren't much interested in musicals/ broadway museums Liberty statue Empire state building Grand station etc (Sorry for the list of no's). I read something about Chelsea market/ High line would that be a good idea.    Finally some suggestions for lunch and/or dinner (Veg not Vegan. I understand its a broad question given the size of the city). They don't have to be super popular some good choices. We could even think of exploring the neighborhood that day based on restaurant suggestions :)    Thanks! ,Harshitha,New York City,"Lakeville, Minnesota"

Hi I‚Äôm travelling to NYC next week with my husband and 2 teenage sons (14 and 16) for 5 nights. We booked quite last minute and have not been before so I quickly reserved 2 hotels and thought we‚Äôd decide closer to the time. I picked the Grayson as it‚Äôs new and seemed to offer good value ($2700 for 5 nights in a double double) and the Refinery as it had 2 queens and a slightly larger room ($3200 in a double queen). Now I can‚Äôt decide whether it‚Äôs worth paying extra for the space at the Refinery (I had thought we‚Äôd be able to have breakfast or dinner at the hotel if we wanted something easy) or saving and staying at the Grayson? Location wise I did prefer the sound of TriBeCa or Chelsea or the LES but I‚Äôm assuming we can still find nice places to eat in the evening not too far from either hotel? Thanks in advance ,JMay14,New York City,

My yearly Open House New York post. This will be my 20th (and last?) year volunteering. I will be volunteering at Fort Totten in Queens on Sunday afternoon and am still trying to figure which sites interest me enough to enter the lottery and which open access sites I want to visit.    For those of you who are still moaning about website crashes etc note that with lotteries you no longer have to get on line the moment the site opens for lottery entries. Also lottery entry winners will be for 2 tickets and NOT 1. Read the explanations on the site.    For those of you who live outside the city there are still some livestream and virtual events.    Who else is attending?    The lottery starts tomorrow. All sites are visible now. Hint. 350 plus sites is overwhelming. Use the filters. Pick the day time and borough you want to explore. You will have a smaller number of sites to review. First pick ticketed so you can see which lotteries you need to enter. Then look at all access sites. http://www.ohny.org ,Ztaks,New York City,Manhattan
I will be traveling with family next week to NYC and have never used Omni before. The four of us will all be using our own devices and tap to pay. However in order to take advantage of the fare caps do we all also need to use a different payment card on our respective devices? I know if we use the same physical card only the first tap counts but I wasn‚Äôt sure if a different device is used (with the same card in Apple Wallet) it would count each device towards their own fare cap. To be safe I‚Äôll probably have each family member use a different card but it would be easier to just use two cards max. Also my husband and I have two separate cards for the same credit card account with different numbers on each card (he is the primary account holder and I‚Äôm an authorized user with a separate card). Does this count as different cards for the purpose of fare caps? ,metcarl,,"Louisville, Kentucky"

Hi guys    I'll be travelling to NYC in a couple of weeks for 7 nights. Will arrive on a Thursday and head back to the UK on the following Thursday. Just wanted some clarification with the following:    1) I'm aware of the OMNY payment system and just wanted to confirm that my contactless debit card will suffice for travel on the NY subway? Or is it recommended for me to purchase a 7 day MetroCard? I use contactless everywhere in London and wanted to know if I can do the same in NYC?    2) As a tourist from the UK will I be required to insert a zip code at any time when making card transactions such as ATM withdrawals payments at restaurants etc?    3) Finally i've heard that SIM cards at the airport are expensive and that I'd be better off purchasing an e-sim from the UK before my travel. What are your recommendations?    Thanks a lot ,haznet,New York City,Greater London...

I know the distance is not far between these two spots  but I can not walk very far at once. can someone either direct me to a website to plan bus routes or tell be which bus I would take from The MET on 5th ave to Neue Galerie or from the neue galerie to the MET. I can go to either first depends on which is most convenient. I will arrive via taxi    thank you ,paris296,New York City,jacksonville
Visiting with my husband and 18 year old daughter from wed 13th dec to Sunday 17th. We arrive about 5pm on the wed and our flight back to the UK on the Sunday is at 7.25pm giving us a good amount of time on the Sunday.    I‚Äôve put together a potential itinery based on what the 3 of us would like to see/do but it is flexible. The only thing that is set as we have booked our tickets already - Six the musical on the Thursday ice hockey match at madison square gardens on the Friday evening and ice skating in Central Park on the Saturday at 6pm. My daughter would like to do the Christmas light walk I‚Äôve seen on here and see the Christmas tree at the Rockefeller centre which I haven‚Äôt included.

Does anyone know if all the rides and restaurants are open on October weekends? I saw someone post that they close more than just the water rides down at this time of year... but then other reviews said October was great.    Also are the lines the average wait? less? more?

We are coming from Maryland to Manhattan tomorrow (if we are able to get there!). Our forecast here is potential tropical storm with high tropical storm force winds heavy rain + tidal/coastal flooding. Is the same forecasted for Manhattan??? We have non-refundable Acela hotel and theater tickets at this late date so we are just hoping for the best. We will have to walk from the hotel to a couple restaurants and theater all 0.2 miles away so I doubt we will be able to get a cab or Uber either so I expect we will be soaked from rain and wind. Hope we can get something from Penn station to the hotel on W 54th. What a bummer! ,SecretSoujourner,New York City,"Annapolis, Maryland"

Hi all    I'm thinking if taking a trip to NYC the 1st week of January and was wondering how the weather was going to be. I've been to paris London and amsterdam in january and figured they would have the same climates?

I've been to NYC once before and fell in love with it. At the end of October my girlfriend and I are staying in Manhattan for a week (our first time there together) and I'm looking for ideas of something romantic to do with her. Can anyone think of something quite original other than taking her to have a nice meal at a fancy restaurant? Is there a particular place or activity or something a bit 'outside the box' that anyone can think of? It's a bit of a long shot but any thoughts will be gratefully received. ,Alex,New York City,Newton Abbot...
We are cruising out of nyc end of month pier 88.    Flying into EWR midmorning. Where would you plan to stay?    Would like a 4 star property maybe 3.5 if going bang for buck.    Our current leaderboard in no particular order.    * something like the hilton ewr. About $180. I know...newark is blah.    *jersey city 4 star on river. $250ish. Pro is very close to PATH to WTC. Been going to that site most every visit since 1977.    *times square 4 star unknown hot deal about $333. Not a big TS fan but proximity to port would make embarkation easy. And could do things if room not available late morning. ,oldestsurfer,New York City,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

Hi everyone! I am thinking about dedicating some of our NYC time to the Hayden Planetarium as I have a teenage daughter who is obsessed with space. It looks like there is an IMAX show which is an additional cost to the ANHM ticket but with the regular ticket are there also displays and exhibits which would be included? Or is the Planetarium really just the show? I'm not sure how much other stuff in the museum she would like to see.    If there are exhibits other than the IMAX approximately how many hours should we allot for seeing them?    Thank you so much! ,Katie,New York City,Alaska

Hi. My wife and I will be visiting NYC for 3 nights from Nov 10th to the 13th. I guess this might be a strange question but I have chronic back problems so I am looking for hotels that have good beds and pillows. We have always stayed with family when visiting NY but they are no longer in the area. I have been looking through reviews of hotels and beds on TA in our price range but it is getting tedious so I thought I would ask this forum for advice. We will be seeing 2 Broadway shows so staying in the midtown area close to a subway would be ideal. Also we hope to find a comfortable room (not ultra-modern) that is not tiny. Our price range would be up to $2000 total. I generally look for newer hotels or recently renovated ones when traveling since I believe that they may have newer beds but that does not always work. I would appreciate any Hotel suggestions. ,RobNTexas,New York City,"Grapevine, Texas"
I booked a night cruise of the New York on the Hudson. I cancelled it so I could rebook it for another evening. TripAdvisor said there was no refund for a cancellation even though I was rebooking for another evening. When I checked in for the cruise I was told that they would have just changed my reservation and not charged me for the cancelled cruise. So now I‚Äôm out over $200 because I booked through TripAdvisor instead of directly with the cruise line. I am no longer booking anything through TripAdvisor! Please heed this warning!!! ,cecirider,,"Berkeley, California"
Hello    I was wondering what people‚Äôs thoughts are on visiting the Statue of Liberty during the day on Mew Years Eve.    Would try and get there as early as possible to get on the first ferry of the day ideally.    We have tickets for a NYE event in the evening so need to allow probably hours to work our way to that from our hotel.    So would try and aim to be back at our hotel by 3/4pm  Would it be feasible on New Year‚Äôs Eve do you think?!    I can swap our itinerary around would just prefer to visit that day as otherwise it would be visiting it in our last day of the holiday.    Any thoughts much appreciated!!! ,LC4308,,"Leicester, England..."

Hello I plan to visit Montauk Lighthouse tomorrow with a group of about 7. I understand I have to pay for parking and there is an admissions fee to see the museum and go into the lighthouse and gift shop.

Can I simply pay for parking and walk around the grounds and get a nice view of the lighthouse and the scenery surrounding it? ,Cheamatic,,"New York City, New..."

We are traveling to NYC next summer and our 3 things we have in our itinerary for which we plan to purchase tickets ahead of time are the Top of the Rock the MoMA and the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island (hopefully crown tickets). We are going the first week of June. Are there times that are better/worse to reserve for these things? I'm thinking maybe earliest available for SoL and MoMA. For TOTR is sunset going to be significantly more crowded or will there be pretty steady crowds throughout the entire day?    Thank you so much for any input! ,Katie,New York City,Alaska

Are trip reports still a thing...? Hope so here goes...    This was our trip originally planned for 2020 ‚Äì so 3years late is better than never.  Flew on Tues 19 Sept MAN ‚Äì JFK with Virgin Atlantic (premium economy thanks to air miles)  Arrived into JFK around 16:00. Took 1hr 40 mins to clear immigration. Bags were waiting once we‚Äôd got through.    Yellow cab from airport to hotel (kicking myself as we didn‚Äôt check the amount with the dispatchers and it‚Äôs been 4 years since we last visited) so pretty sure we charged over the odds at $95. But hey ho!    Stayed at VoCo IHG Hotel on 36th and 9th. My husband travels for work and is a Platinum Elite IHG member. He contacted them ahead of our trip to tell them it was for our wedding anniversary. On arrival no upgrade nor was there even mention of our anniversary. Disappointing but no issue.    Hotel was ok. Pricey for what it is. Room was tiny but fine. Bathroom was nice but no real ventilation so had a damp smell. The most annoying thing was no storage in the room. No wardrobe or drawers so the room just felt like it was a constantly in a mess. We had to live out of suitcases the whole time.    Anyway we checked in and went for a wander. We were tired and hungry so landed at the Beer Authority grabbed some drinks and a burger. We then went for a walk to get our bearings.    Early to bed thanks to the time difference.    Wed 20 September  Up showered and out bright and early and headed towards the Roosevelt Island Tramway Plaza entrance. Area was full of mercs with blacked out windows ‚Äì clearly something going on in the UN building.    Stopped for breakfast just a couple of blocks from the Tramway plaza. Pretty sure it was called Joe‚Äôs but google has failed me. It was delicious. Full of NYPD Officers ‚Äì the radio traffic was interesting to listen too!    Jumped on the cable car over to Roosevelt Island ‚Äì we use just tapped our phones as payment. Super easy. Off the cable car and we walked all the way to the top and then back down again. Lovely and peaceful in beautiful sunshine. We ended with a drink in Granny Annie‚Äôs on the Island.    We then jumped on the water taxi from RI and got off at the Wall Street stop. This was lovely in the sunshine great views of the city and really cheap. Would def use this again.  We then walked about South Street Sea Port area (involving a few more bar stops!)    Called in Trinity Church to see Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs resting place (and Hercules Mulligan‚Äôs).    From one extreme to another we then strolled up and end up at Macy‚Äôs. It was early evening by this point and it was fairly quiet for Macy‚Äôs so popped in. We found a bar close to our hotel and grabbed some food before heading back to our hotel.    Thurs 21 September  Up pretty early again so headed to the Skylight Diner on 34th & 9th for breakfast (which was lovely!) and then headed to see The Vessel then onto The High Line. I love this place. Feels like you are miles away from the craziness of the City. We really took our time and enjoyed the gardens the art the buildings overlooking it and chatted to lots of the volunteers. We were also more than happy to give a donation before exiting into Chelsea.    We then took the subway over to Brooklyn and headed to DUMBO. I will NEVER tire and sitting there and looking back at Manhattan ‚Äì I just love it. Helped by gorgeous weather of course.    We then walked the Brooklyn Bridge back. It was busy but I‚Äôve seen it much worse so we were pretty pleased.    From there we walked up towards Greenwich Village and called in Marie‚Äôs Crisis. I have had this place on my wish list for the four years. I LOVED IT. So relaxed welcoming full of twinkling lights and songs from musicals. If you don‚Äôt know what it is it‚Äôs a LGBTQ+ Piano Bar with people sat round singing show tunes. Taking requests. Making fun of my requests. LOVED IT. Will def be going back. Just remember there is a tip jar on the piano - if you go make sure you put some dollars in.    We then headed back towards our hotel and just grabbed some food in a bar. Nothing special but just want we needed.    Fri 22 September  Our 13th Wedding Anniversary. We headed out to our fav diner The Red Flame on 44th for breakfast. Love it here. We then took the subway up to 105th Street to go into the Conservatory Garden in Central Park where we got married 13years ago to the day. We were so lucky with the weather and it was really quiet so had a good walk around reminiscing about our day the nerves the excitement. It was just lovely.    We then walked through the park. Lots of stops to just take it all in. Lots of people watching.    The day just flew by so we now had to grab some food quickly. We Opted for Blooms Tavern on 58th & 3rd. We then popped back to our hotel to freshen up and head to the Theatre as we had Hamilton Tickets. Musicals are my thing. I have seen Hamilton 5 times in the UK. But Hamilton on Broadway is something else. I may have cried several times.    I spent lots of time looking at tickets. The prices vary massively. Some are around $80 more just to sit one row forward ‚Äì which is just crazy. I went mid price range and the seats were fab. We booked ahead of time as I didn‚Äôt want to risk sell out and not being able to see it.    Sat 23 September  We knew the weather was due to change and change it did. Hello rain rain and more rain. We popped by the Skylight diner for breakfast then out into the wet & miserable weather. We headed South towards Battery Park it was grim! As in why are we walking around in this grim.    My husband and I season ticket holders at Manchester United and they were due to kick off so we headed to Smithfield Hall which is the home of the NYC MUFC supporters branch and watched the game in the dry! May have stayed a little while afterwards too as the weather was just YUCK!    We then walked up toward our hotel and called into various shops and bars to avoid being in the rain for too long. But fair to say we were soaked (despite waterproofs hoods hats etc). so decided to grab some food and eat back at our hotel. Random one but I don't like cheese. But love pizza (with no cheese). So difficult to just grab a slice but we found a place called Luv Pizza - where I could order a small pizza (without cheese). Took 10mins and we managed to get them back to the hotel fairly dry! It was lovely would recommend.    Sunday 24 Sept  Our last full day - and NFL game day!  We opted for Andrews Diner on 35th & 7th for breakfast. Disappointed. Do not recommend and wont be going back. All of the other diners we used for breakfast were far far better. Food welcome table layout etc were all poor.    When then headed to Penn Station to get the train up to the Met Life Stadium. We had planned the trip booked tickets in advance (but only activated them on the morning as only valid for so long after activation). Two trains so just one change. Cheap simple well signposted lots of people available to help / direct. So for anyone going to the Met Life don't pay the cab fare - this was REALLY easy honestly.    We've been to an NFL game in the US before (Dolphins v Bears at the Hard Rock in Miami) and watch lots of it from the UK so we do actually understand it! Poor game (unfortunately) but it was great to be there. We watched the Jets first game before we left the UK so saw Aaron Rodgers getting injured - so gutted not to have seen him play. The Met Life is a pretty cool stadium. Thankfully our seats were just (and I mean just) undercover - those in front of us were soaked :( So in summary easy to get too tickets were pricey poor game but loved the experience of it. Go Jets!    Mon 25 Sept  Our last day - the rain was still pouring down so had a late start to the day checked out about 11:00. Left our luggage and headed to the Red Flame (again!) for brunch. As it was after the breakfast rush we took our time as there was no wait for tables.    After that we went to did some last minute shopping. The usual (for us) of Coppertone Sunscreen (buying it whilst it was raining felt odd but its much cheaper in the US so I like to stock up) Swedish Fish and Ghiradelli caramel squares to name a few. We passed the time shopping and called in to a couple of places for drinks then headed back to our hotel to wait for our car.    We booked the car to the airport via booking.com. We have used this option lots of times with no issues. This time however... The car that turned up was pretty battered and when he opened the boot for our cases it was covered in his work tools looked like he was plasterer. So guessing works in the city then picks up a job to take people to the airport as he lives that way. Good on him but my goodness!! it was terrible. He fell sleep whilst in traffic twice! I had to keep asking him if he was awake and felt ok to drive. He also had a very loud audio book playing in Chinese which he refused to turn down saying it was to keep him focused. I am not joking! So bad it was hilarious. Anyway we got a full refund when we got home.    Flight home was fine on time and the crew were super helpful as I didn't like any of the food so ended up with about 6 different food options presented to me! Thanks Virgin Atlantic :)    If you've made it this far bless you! I like to do these reports as they help me when planning the next trip so thanks for allowing me to do so. There may even be a couple of things mentioned which could help someone else.    I should say we were a bit rubbish with food this trip and just grabbed food here and there - so mainly in bars. Will do better next time on that front.    We are back for a quick 3 night visit in early Dec to take in all the Christmasy sights. We've been in Dec before we love it. Countdown is on! :) ,Earlp78,New York City,"Wrexham, United..."

Hello all    We are visiting NYC at the end of May ‚Äò24 our first time back since Dec 2012 but now with our 8 year old son.    We are looking for hotel recommendations that have families in mind and a friendly atmosphere within a budget of around $400 a night and a great location too (doesn‚Äôt everybody!). Places to eat near by that cater for kids would also be a plus and yes somewhere reasonably central so walking isn‚Äôt an issue as unfortunately my wife doesn‚Äôt do the subway if she can help it (last time she was quite happy to walk from 42nd St to Battery Park and back although not quite sure an 8 year old would enjoy that!).    Not sure at this stage of exactly where or what we would like to see this time around other than the Intrepid Museum as we have an avid aviation buff on our hands. A boat and / or bus tour would be good plus I know we‚Äôd also like to walk the Highline and explore some of the areas we haven‚Äôt visited before like the areas on The Hudson.    Many thanks ,Gazsim34,New York City,"Cheadle, United..."
My husband and I are 77 and 80. We will be flying out of JFK to go to Europe tomorrow. I‚Äôm packing right now and have two options.  I can put things into two small carryons along with our two stuffed personal size bags. We will be returning a rental car to a nearby Hertz location first and taking a shuttle to the airport.    Or I can put everything into one large suitcase which we would check. It sounds like a no brainer but I‚Äôm hesitant to do that. We already had a bad experience with lost luggage this summer. Fortunately it was at the end of our trip or we would have been on a cruise without our clothes.  So the problem was with United coming into Newark.  I‚Äôm asking about your experience with American at JFK. We are going to Athens Greece and after a couple of hours we will take another flight to a small island.  What would you do? ,FanzofTA,New York City,"Jersey City, New..."
I am planning on total ankle replacement at Hospital for Special Surgery. I need to keep that ankle elevated above heart level for 2 weeks. My husband will be with me. A friend who did this last month drove somewhere in CT for the 2 wks until first return appt. Suggestions of where I could spend this time would be appreciated. Obviously will not be leaving the room/condo though my husband will. Are there any extended stay or vrbo places on one level (no stairs) that are an easy commute from Manhattan? Not sure how I will get there. I think my friend drove her husband and he kept his ankle elevated in back seat. My husband can't imagine driving in NYC. We are from MT. ,Martha R,New York City,"Billings, Montana"

It's been on my list for quite a while to attend the Macy's parade once in my lifetime and my mom is finally on board this year. We're not very far ~90 mins away in South Jersey but she doesn't get into the city much due to anxiety with logistics of urban environments (she doesn't do elevators or public transportation). I'm trying to make this as easy for her as possible with our choice of hotel.    Our tentative plan is to leave early the morning of Thanksgiving and drive up as my mom is concerned about nightmare holiday traffic Wednesday night with everyone trying to get to family in time. We would then park at the hotel and walk to the parade route. Because we would be arriving the morning of the parade I'm assuming it would be easiest to stay in Hell's Kitchen/Hudson Yards area due to road closures for the parade (though please correct me if I'm wrong!)    Is anyone aware of any hotels on the west side of Manhattan with low floor rooms/easily accessible stairs? What I mean by this is they aren't emergency only locked for guest use have to be escorted by engineering every time etc. I fully understand that every hotel is *required* to have stairs; however I've learned over several years of traveling with my mom that stairs in city hotels can often be a logistical nightmare and just because they have them doesn't mean you can use them.    Any recommendations for a hotel that meets this description would be greatly appreciated! It would be nice if it's a Marriott (we both have high status) but it's certainly not a requirement - access is my #1 priority. Thank you in advance for the suggestions! ,mbg996,New York City,Philadelphia...

Morning    We are booked to stay at the Stewart in February next year. I selected this hotel a few months ago and all was good or so I thought. I came on to TA a couple of days ago and thought id read up on some new reviews of the Stewart and they are frankly horrendous. I also see the Stewart has possibly been sold to developers who are going to change the building into apartments. Being in Scotland I can‚Äôt read more about this development as I need to subscribe to websites or I am restricted due to not being in the States. I am however thinking the hotel won‚Äôt be having any maintenance dealt with if it has indeed been sold so it‚Äôs just going to get worse before we get there next year.    Can anyone local tell me if it has been sold and if there is any indication of a date for closure?    Thanks very much for your help. ,Valefan,New York City,"Scotland, United..."
Because there's a question here about once a month regarding outdoor dining (i.e. post-Covid) I wanted to report what I saw on West 55th Street last Saturday.    The city shut down the block from 6th to 7th Avenues and about six huge Sanitation Department vehicles demolished and carted off all the street-sheds on the block. It's newsworthy because (I didn't actually check the day before) these included Quality Bistro Estiatorio Milos and (closed vacatant) Black Tap. The first two are $100 per person fine dining and there are plenty of branches of Black Tap still open.    It remains to be seen if this is an example of Corporate Welfare or if they will be forced to pay for the city's work. But the point is that while approved sidewalk cafes are not affected there will be fewer outdoor-dining options this winter.    https://abc7ny.com/outdoor-dining-nyc-restaurants-seating/13656572/    https://www.diningoutnyc.info/ ,obsoperator,New York City,"Bergen County, New..."

We are a family of 4 from India (ages 17 to 48) planning a trip to USA in May 2024.  I initially planned a road trip on West Coast for which I got very good advices from TA.  Now our kids are insisting on doing New York and Orlando so I am exploring that option also before finalizing one of the itineraries.  I am getting a good flight offer only from Mumbai-New York-Mumbai and hence I have considered this while making my itinerary. Multi-city tickets are much more expensive.  I am considering the following itinerary and would appreciate any advice on this:  Day 1 : Arrive in New York from India  Day 2 3 and 4 : Sightseeing in New York.  Day 5 : New York to Washington by train  Day 6 and 7 : Washington sightseeing  Day 8 : Washington to Orlando by flight. I need some suggestion about flights which will allow check-in baggage since we will all be carrying bags. Is Southwest the only airline that allows check-in bags? Is flight the only option to travel from DC to Orlando?  Day 9 and 10 : Either 2 Universal Theme parks or 1 Universal and 1 Disney park each.  Day 11 : Come back to New York by flight or should I spend one more day in Orlando?  Day 12 : New York sightseeing / shopping  Day 13 : Return to India  Though Universal Park is quite expensive we all thoroughly enjoy them have earlier been to one in Japan. But we won't do more than 2 parks as the price is stiff. I will make sure that we visit the Parks during Weekdays only.  I can also do NY-Orlando-DC-NY if that is better in any way.  Does the above plan seem ok? Any expected issues in May.?  Any suggestions will be appreciated. ,TravellingMumbaikar,,"Mumbai, India"

Hello for our second New York trip (celebrating my retirement) my husband die do not want to fill up our days with lots of reservations. We‚Äôre going to see a show or two which I will book ahead. Our other priorities are museums particularly the Met and the Cloisters and if fall foliage is still on display then a ferry or train tour of the Hudson River Valley or similar.    Unfortunately the earliest day the SeaStreak tour to Cold Spring is operational during our stay will be November 11; do you think that will be too late for decent fall foliage? And how far ahead do the ferries and the museums tend to book up? (I know I can stand in line for a ticket to most museums day of but are the lines prohibitive?)    TIA for any wisdom! ,almostfloridanative,,"Orlando, Florida"

We have to change hotels on 7 June supposedly to check in at Hyatt grand central ( if still open) to begin a bus tour from.all suggestions welcome  thank you. ,missvicki50,New York City,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi guys    My Wife and I along with her daughter and husband (all from UK) are hitting NYC in November and I'm tasked with getting us from the airport to the hotel.  Last time I was in NYC we took a sedan from JFK. Can any of you guys recommend a good firm to reach out to and setup a cool private transfer from the airport to the hotel? Budget is of course a consideration but I'd rather pay a little more than sit in a shuttle bus with a bunch of folks.    Cheers in advance for anything a little quirky ,Wiggz,New York City,Warwickshire
So.....we just found out that our pet-sitter will not be able to stay with our dog next week during our planned vacation in the Finger Lakes. We love our little guy but it's not the same as being able to do whatever/whenever we'd like. As I am a plan b kind of person I had booked a hotel that accepts pets (The Hampton in Penn Yan). I'd appreciate recommendations for outdoor restaurants that allow dogs. Thankfully the weather looks great next week. We're thinking we'll do our main meal as a late lunch and will bring our Cooper with us. We'll have beauty all around us so the view isn't as important as good food! We like American Italian Greek/Mediterranean and Mexican types of food. I am counting the seconds until I can get a plate of garlic knots at Jerlando's.    We've never taken our dog on vacation and would appreciate tips/suggestions. I don't know if we should leave him in the hotel room alone. I know we can put out the do not disturb sign but if housekeeping or maintenance were to open the door he might be startled and bolt. I'm thinking to get him an extra collar tag with the hotel info on it along w/mine. ,sjeffery1,Finger Lakes,MD
We are starting to look at a return trip to NYC in late December and early January (probably straddling NYE but not 100% sure yet). Everything is flexible about this trip except we will stay in a Bonvoy hotel. Last year at the same time we stayed at the Marriott Marquis which was exactly what we wanted that year but we don't need to be in the fray this year.    Any hotels I should particularly look at-- either for great location great views great service etc?    Thanks all! ,LonghornGirl03,New York City,"Austin, Texas"
Hi me & my friends will be visiting NYC from Monday 13th to the Friday 17th November.    We plan to buy a 4 day NY Pass & we hope to visit the MET the American Museum of Natural history Artechouse 9/11 memorial museum MoMA the Edge the One World Observatory the top of the rock & the Summit.    I've visited NYC a few times but only in May/June & never in November; I just want to get an idea on how busy places like the above will be & when will be the best time of day to visit...    Any information would be greatly appreciated...thanks! :) ,Polly Rice,,
We will be staying around Central Park South and are looking for new restaurants to try that have a variety of decent food for my wife and I but also have meals for our picky kids.

Heading to the city in late October and taking my tween daughter for her first trip ever. I haven‚Äôt been in nearly a decade. We‚Äôll see a Broadway show I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd love to see Rockefeller Center or Grand Central Station - definitely want to take her through the park to Soho/Tribeca and in general just enjoy walking/eating/being together/browsing shops (but we‚Äôre not heavy shoppers).    I‚Äôm not looking to spend upwards of $500/night. Found rates under that for both Soho Grand and Bryant Park. Is Bryant Park still ok? Or has it gone downhill? Was also considering Hotel Gansevoort. Open to any suggestions or hidden gems!    Also she‚Äôs never seen a Broadway show so even the ones (like Wicked) would be exciting to her. What would you suggest?  - SIX  - & Juliet?  - Wicked (she still hasn‚Äôt seen this so I know she‚Äôd love it)  We are literally completely open! ,PennyLayne111,New York City,Santa Barbara...
In the event that there is a Federal government shutdown on Sunday 1 Oct. 2023 the National Park Service will close all of its properties including the statue and Ellis Island.

Hello my husband and I are travelling to NYC next week. We have bought a city pass to cover all the usual tourist spots I'm just wondering how much we need to book in advance? So far we've booked a comedy show theatre show and a restaurant for our anniversary. We aren't particularly bothered about booking anything else for an evening will just see how we go. But what about tourist spots? We want to visit The Edge statue of liberty (not pedestal) 9/11 memorial museum One World observation deck Empire State Rockerfeller centre etc - can we just turn up? Thanks. ,Woowoo,New York City,
Hi all! We‚Äôre driving to Lake Placid this weekend (sept 30-Oct 2) with our 5 month old and will be there for about 48 hrs and staying at the High Peaks resort. First time for a long car journey with the baby (4.5hrs) and unsure of what to expect thus keeping the itinerary very flexible. Apart from walking alongside the lake and driving through some scenic byways I would like to ride the cloudspitter gondola and hike the high falls gorge. I just wanted to make sure both places are baby carrier/stroller safe and the weather isn‚Äôt too cold at the top for the baby. Any additional suggestions most welcome! Looking forward to fall in the Adirondacks :) ,Adventure502068,,

A 3/4 inch travelling replica of the Vietnam War Memorial that is in Washington DC will be in Flushing Meadow Park in Queens until this weekend Oct 1 2023. It will then go to Babylon LI (IM not sure where)    Its called the Wall that heals    To get to it take the 7 trains to Mets-Williets point (Citifield / Tennis center Station) and walk over the train yards towards the Tennis center. When you get off the Bridge by the Tennis Center make a Left and walk towards the Ice Skating Rink / Pool . Its Behind this Building. While you are visiting the memorial you can see the unisphere NYS Pavillion  The Column of Jerush I(2nd old structure in NYC) and the Queens Museum    Here is what the War Memorial looks like      https://www.instagram.com/p/CxvKyMAJ-G_/ ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City
We are coming to the city in a few weeks for just a couple of nights--Oct 20--22. We aren't as far along in planning our itinerary as we should be. The purpose of coming to town is to see Billy Joel in MSG before he ends his residency so we are doing that on the 20th evening. We are seeing Hamilton on the 21st evening. We have dinner reservations before each of those. Otherwise we will likely do a noon walking tour of Central Park on either the 21st or 22nd (unless the experts here would advise otherwise) and will do Top of the Rock--VIP option on either the 21st or 22nd. We have a few ideas for other activities to fill in the gaps---working on it--- maybe a river cruise for potential fall foilage maybe the 911 museum I'm a Peloton Junkie so maybe pop by the studio....just not sure of everything yet. Flight on the 22nd from LGA at 6pm-ish.    So it seems that Midtown East or West or Central Park seem like good options for where to stay? Would that make sense based on our time there and the things we know we will do?  We would like to be close to subway if possible. We lean towards more modern than old style hotel but can appreciate a classic. Would love a view but budget may not allow. I am thinking about $750/night inclusive of taxes etc....or $600ish base rate. That certainly isn't a hard stop but the general idea of what I am thinking for maximum. Would love any specific recommendations that you may have. Honestly I think the olden days of using Priceline to name my price took some of the stress out of it because whatever we got in the area and star level we had to deal with :) I am a little overwhelmed. Appreciate any advice for properties. ,bigmacfan,New York City,Saint Charles...

Planning our first trip to NY and have narrowed it down to 2 hotels. - the Even Hotel (221 East 44th Street in Midtown East) or the Belvedere (319 W 48th St closer to Hell's Kitchen). Does anyone have any thoughts on which area we should stay in? I was told Midtown would be best but then I see there's Midtown East and other sub-areas of Midtown. The Even Hotel in Midtown seems farther away from Times Square etc. than the Belvedere. Is Midtown actually very big? Any advice? Thank you! ,RCC,New York City,"Vancouver, Canada"
We are attending a show and looking for any recommendations for a restaurant afterwards. We probably won‚Äôt be out of the theater until 10 pm or maybe later depending on how quickly the theater disperse everyone. I did look at a couple of nearby restaurants and some close at 11 so I know those won‚Äôt work. We are 4 adults it‚Äôs on a Friday in the fall and we like all kinds of food and was hoping for a nice sit down restaurant that is located near or in the Theater District or Hells Kitchen. We are staying in the area so not looking to venture too far. Thank you in advance for your recommendations! ,Frqtvisitor,New York City,Delaware

We are a family of 4 (ages 17 to48) planning a trip to USA in May 2024. Family is keen that we do a road trip so I am just starting to plan one and wanted some advice.  We are not yet decided on East or West Coast and I want to check both options.    Is an itinerary as below doable :  1) Arrive New York stay 3 nights  2) To Philadelphia 2 nights  3) To Washington DC 3 nights  4) Back to New York 2 nights  I think I can add a 2-3 nights more in the trip but not sure where to go.  Are there any nearby national parks or scenic places which can be added to the route?  We are not too much interested in beaches or other historical places Washington would be good enough for us I think.  I know that there is a good train connectivity in this route but we are keen on traveling by road since we would have luggage for 4 persons. Also if we want to cover any additional places I think a car would be required.  I am thinking of taking a car when we leave from NY as one is not needed in NY. However I would need to keep it parked in DC as I don't think we need the car for inside the city. Or should I leave the car in DC and take another one from DC to NY?  Will parking be a problem or would it be very expensive?  Are the roads tourist friendly?  Which are the recommended car rentals in that area?  Are there road tolls and how much do these cost?    Another option is to do Wast Coast SF - Yosemite - Las Vegas - Grand Canyon - LA - SF by car.  Would a road trip on East Coast be more expensive or one on West Coast?    Any advices would be greatly appreciated and help in in starting my planning. ,TravellingMumbaikar,,"Mumbai, India"

Planning a short trip with my son who wants to do the following:    Statue of Liberty (Pedestal)  9/11 Memorial (probably the museum guided tour - 60min)  One World Trade  Metropolitan Museum    My plan is to tackle the first 3 on the Saturday. Maybe grab the 9am ferry for the Statue. Not sure how to space the 9/11 memorial and One World Trade while factoring in some lunch and dinner. Any thoughts to how long I should plan for each? Are they sticklers for timed entry if we showed up a bit early / late? Washington DC was timed entry but we found most times they didn't care when you got there.    We will be driving home Sunday so figured we could maybe walk around the Seaport early and then drive up to the Met and leave from there. They don't seem to open until 10am so maybe explore Seaport and get a good view of the Brooklyn Bridge? ,Roccomac09,New York City,Waltham...

Trying to plan an upcoming weekend in NYC for my daughter's 16th BDay - also traveling along with us will be my husband and my son (13).    My daughter has many things she wants to see and do while in NYC but I have tempered expectations a bit due to time and budget constraints and I honestly think she'll be happy with any kind of sampler experience of NYC - as she's very excited just to go.  (She's a musical theater kid so that will be the main highlight!!)    SATURDAY  -Arrive in Harrisburg;plan to take 11:30 AM train arriving in NYC around 3 PM  -(NY style pizza counter place w/ good reviews ‚Äì right across the street from station)  -Uber or subway to hotel  -Check into hotel & freshen up.  -Walk to theater with stops along the way: NY Public Library Grand Central Station  -Broadway show begins at 8 PM    SUNDAY  -Subway to 9/11 Memorial (... I think we may have to save 9/11 museum and other museums for another visit w/ more time)  -Express ferry around Statue of Liberty or/and Circle Boat Tour (...opinions on specific boat tours?)  -Uber to lunch in Chinatown area (too far? too rushed? ... daughter is interested in visiting Chinatown)  -Subway to Central Park (... Central Park bike tour or just walk around? I can see this eating up all kinds of time without a specific plan which is why I was looking at the idea of a tour...).  -Walk back to hotel with stop at Rockefeller Center/ Top of the Rock along the way  (....Too rushed? Should I plan to purchase a timed ticket for early evening before sunset or after dinner potentially after sunset instead?)  -Shower & go to dinner near hotel    MONDAY OCT. 9  -Plan to leave NYC on 9:30 AM train - otherwise noon train    Currently I have the San Carlos Hotel booked (150 East 50th Street) but I've also discovered another hotel with rooms with two queen beds that looks pretty nice & well-located so I may cancel the San Carlos & book it instead: Merrion Row Hotel 119 West 45th Street.

My twin sister and I (and my brother in law) are celebrating our 60th next year and we are planning to be in NYC for 6 nights in May 2024. We had an Airbnb booked but that has now been cancelled. Can anyone recommend some nice areas to stay in which are quite central and affordable (not Tines square please)? We want a decent hotel (¬£160 per night). I am looking on the usual booking sites and everything is very expensive. ,SusieQte,New York City,"Cheshire, United..."

hey folks me and my wife are hoping to do a first time visit to NYC on a road trip Fri Oct 6 ( 5 am) - Monday Oct 9 ( 11 am checkout) from Toronto to NYC. I hope to get advice on Stops and stays and budget( while keeping it a nice trip for my wife as I always make her go to off grid cabins with no electricity or water lol so hoping to balance with this ) . total trip budget ~2000$usd      - Hotels im torn between which would also define the type of trip:    A. Canopy by Hilton Jersey City Arts District ( 84$ parking + transit costs) = ~1200$ but will have to take the PATH I can't figure out still how much that will cost me for trips deep into manhattan  is it just the single PATH fare or I will have to pay again when i switch lines.    B. Innside By Meli√° New York Nomad or Freehand NY or Even Hotel ( resort fees + parking and hotel ) = 1450$. obviously the advantage here is no transit time into city but smaller rooms and 250$ lost from the budget that can go towards dining and museum in NYC      - Another idea to save some hotel money and as I am trying to keep my hotel 4-5 star I was wondering if I cut the friday night stay from NYC and slept somewhere else interesting and arrive in NYC on Saturday morning is this worth losing the half day in NYC ( I would have arrived around 3pm on friday if i go straight) and see somewhere else along the way and have entire Saturday and sunday and leave 11 am on monday    any advice is much appreciated thank you all ,Samy Ir,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"
Hello and help!  We are 5 people (2 adults and 3 teenager 17 15 14) coming to NYC for first time in July 2024 - wanting to tick all the typical first timer boxes (central park empire state high line 911 memorial brooklyn bridge etc). I realise nowhere will be near everywhere. Looking for a hotel with some hanging out space as the teenagers will not tolerate 12 hours a day sightseeing and of course it will be really hot!  We need 2 rooms (double double + King or similar). Budget around $400 per room per night.  I have narrowed down hotel choice to Ace Hotel (because of the connecting loft suite) Giraffe Hotel and MSocial - all pricing about the same. Any thoughts or other suggestions? Is a roof terrace (Giraffe/MSocial) worth it for July? Is MSocial in an area that is too hectic/touristy (though we are tourists!)? Is Ace too trendy/more for adults?! Not all hotels are showing availability for July 2024 yet. am I better waiting a bit?    Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice! I am spending quite a lot of time on the internet searching currently! ,Cheryl R,New York City,"Scotland, United..."
Sorry if this is elsewhere Im new to this.    We are staying in December for six nights just have a few questions. Genuine thanks to anyone who can help as I have had no reply from the hotel.    1) Anyone know the hotel charges? Is it 100 per night deposit and 40 fees? Can we pay cash for this? Any other fees added on?    2) How BAD is the noise? People have said there noise making sleeping almost impossible during the night?    3) We are wanting to do a helicopter ride? Do we need to book these well in advance or can we book it when we are there?    Thanks' again  Matt :) ,Matt,New York City,

I received a notice today from NYC Ballet that the advance Nutcracker sale for Mastercard holders buying with their Mastercards starts September 11 two weeks before the public on sale date of September 25. Performances run from November 24 through December 31. nycballet.com or 212-496-0600    Many towns and cities small and large do the Nutcracker. Some of the better known ones outside NYC include Seattle (Pacific Northwest Ballet) San Francisco (San Francisco Ballet) Salt Lake City (Ballet West) southern California (American Ballet Theater at the Segerstrom center for the arts in Costa Mesa) Phoenix (Ballet Arizona) Houston (Houston Ballet) Kansas City (Kansas City Ballet) Miami (Miami City Ballet which also does the Nut in Ft Lauderdale and West Palm Beach) Washington DC (Ballet West takes its Nut to the Kennedy Center over Thanksgiving weekend) Philadelphia (Philadelphia Ballet formerly known as Pennsylvania Ballet) and Boston (Boston Ballet). The Seattle Miami and Philly companies all do the same George Balanchine production that NYC Ballet does. The version done by Ballet West is known as the oldest Nutcracker in the US and was choreographed by Lew Christensen in the 1940s when he was head of San Francisco Ballet. He later left SF to found Ballet West in SLC. (SF Ballet itself no longer does the Christensen version; I believe they have a newer version set in SF around the time of the 1906 earthquake).    For people with very young children NY Theatre Ballet does a short one-hour version intended for children as young as 2 or 3 (NYC Ballet recommends that children at its performances be I think at least 5). The NY Theatre Ballet performances can be caught at various places around NYC including over a weekend in mid December at Florence Gould Hall at the Alliance Francaise. I think they have sometimes also done free performances at the Brookfield mall in downtown Manhattan. ,Grandrue,New York City,United States

Hi all. My wife and I are visiting middle of October and we want to walk over the Brooklyn bridge and back over via the Manhattan bridge. If found that you can walk across both but I searched and can‚Äôt find where you would get on the Manhattan bridge on the Brooklyn side. A bit of context. I‚Äôm 65 and have crap legs from a serious motorcycle accident 9 years ago. I do walk about 5 miles a day but with a cane. I‚Äôve walked 1/2 way over the Brooklyn bridge on one of our previous visits but want to walk both this time. Looking at maps and google earth it looks like you can‚Äôt get on the Manhattan bridge unless your way back into Brooklyn. Where do you get on the bridge? I just want to feel I can do it.

Looking for a good gooey bacon egg and cheese sandwich. I will be staying at The Pearl NYC on West 49th and forgive me if this is inaccurate but I believe that‚Äôs the Theatre District?

Hi we need help for our honeymoon. We are in New York for New year and want to know please if the ball drop is better or a cruise to have as the special moment to celebrate New year.  Just 2 of us and my partner can't be out in the cold or standing or be with so many people for a long period of time. I have looked at party's but Applebee's for the ball drop is the only thing remotely in our price range to see the ball drop live. Are there other options for less than 800 each for like party or restaurants with a live view or an area to see.  If cruises are as good or better then which are the best less than 800 each please?

Among typical first time tourist attractions which one require prebooking?    So far I can think of the following    Statue of Liberty  Top of Rock or Empire State Bldg (I'll visit only one)    How far in advance I need to book? Can I land in USA and then book for visit next day or 2 days later or I need to book even before landing in USA?    Between Top of Rock and Empire State Bldg which one is easier to visit e.g. I can simply turn up and buy a ticket for top floor? ,holidzf,New York City,"London, United..."
On the app and webpage when you click on buy the tickets there are no specific seats allocated just a range. When do you know what seats you get?

I have had some great ideas helping me plan going to Chinatown from Midtown. However it makes me realise that I really could do with some help planning what to do in New York as I only have approx 2.5 days in mid October.    I know that I want to go to the Ellis Island museum and see the Statue of Liberty from the ferry. I was also wanting to go to Chelsea market and see the highline. I enjoy walking although obviously this will depend on the weather. I would also like to see Grand Central Station and find some quirky shops esp for clothes or homeware. I have already got Fishs eddy and economy candy on my list from previous suggestions. I was planning to do a foodtour around Chinatown but I am now wondering if this is a good use of my time or if I should be perhaps walking around Greenwich / West Village or over the Brooklyn Bridge as I only have a short time?

Greetings:    Been presented with an interesting choice:    Currently booked at The William Vale in Williamsburg in a Gotham Queen with a direct view of the Manhattan skyline. Have the option of switching to Virgin Hotel in NoMad for slightly more ($160-220 for my entire 4 night stay in early October depending upon city v Empire State Building view).    Enjoyed my stay last year at William Vale‚Äîfar less touristy than Manhattan good restaurants in neighborhood less high rise/boxed in feel.    Have stayed in NoMad before at Edition. Liked nearby Madison Square Park not sure as many restaurants I enjoyed in immediate area as I did in Wm‚Äôburg would be a bit easier/faster to get to from JFK.    I like both neighborhoods‚Ä¶.would either hotel (good or bad) make or break where you stayed ??

What in your opinion are the best seats at the New York City Ballet in the David Koch Theater? (And maybe if it's a different answer what are the best value!) Hoping to see Nutcracker this Christmas.    Is there much of a slant/rake between rows of seats in the different areas? I'd like as much as possible to not be worried that our view will be blocked by heads in front of us. I expect the front row of one of the rings is the best option for that but then I'm also wondering if the railing in front of the row obstructs your view at all / if you have to lean forward to see over it? ,L A,New York City,
My daughter and I are driving from Hagerstown Maryland to Bridgeport Connecticut today. We are considering stopping over in NYC for lunch and a quick walk around. It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve been to the city so might be a nice little stop. We want to make it fairly quick and we are driving a very large rental car full of stuff so I don‚Äôt want to drive through the city. Would there be a convenient spot just below or above the city to park take the train in and then go around the city to get to our final destination? It may be just way too complicated and not worth the hassle. Just thought I would ask on here in case there‚Äôs a good solution. ,amy_marcomamma,New York City,"Knoxville, Tennessee"
My daughter (14) and I went to New York in May and absolutely loved it. So much so that she really wants to go back again next year. The savings are dwindling but it‚Äôs doable. I‚Äôd love to go back myself but I feel a different adventure would be a better idea and I‚Äôm thinking Japan.  Thing is my daughter doesn‚Äôt fancy Japan and she‚Äôs not the most experimental with food. Plus the flight! I reckon she‚Äôd like it when she‚Äôs there but it‚Äôs an expensive gamble.  There‚Äôs still a lot of New York we didn‚Äôt see so there‚Äôs that. Can you do too much New York!?  Anyway I guess this is a you decide for me thing. What would you do if you were in a similar situation? ,Nick,,"Manchester, United..."

Hi!    Does anybody know if Bryant Park ice skating and the winter village are usually open for their typical hours on New Year's Eve or do they close early?    Also would ice skating in BP on the morning of the December 31st be okay or would that area just be too close to Times Square and as a result be too busy and a no-go? Could it be affected¬†by police cordons?    Thank you! ,L A,New York City,

Reposting from the New York State board    Hi    I am struggling to choose between different accommodations for our second trip to New York City for 7 nights.    We are a family of four and our kids will be 8 and 11. The kids are happy sharing a bed but if they can have their own beds that is a bonus.    Our budget is ideally maximum $380 but we could go to $450 per night. We usually spend less but are stretching our budget because being a big amazing city NYC accommodation is more expensive.    Area wise we would like to be in central Manhattan or are considering staying in Brooklyn and getting to know that area better.    Last time we stayed at the Broadway Plaza Hotel. It was ok but our kids wake and eat breakfast early and the lack of proper tea making facilities and no restaurant meant breakfasts were a bit of a hassle. Ideally we‚Äôd like a kitchenette or some kind of on site cafe or restaurant where we can make or get breakfast without having to leave the hotel first thing in the morning.    Air conditioning (it‚Äôll be August and hot!) cleanliness and good wi-fi are a must. Size of the room view and multiple bathrooms are less important to us.    Options we are considering are below. I‚Äôd love your thoughts on location quality and value for money. Which would you choose to stay in?    Thanks so much.    James hotel - $500 per night for 2 x queen beds    AKA apartments NOMAD - $470 for 2 x double beds    Msocial Times Square - $430 for 2 x double beds    Radio city apartments - $390 for 2 double beds + sofa bed + kitchenette    Nu Hotel Brooklyn - $390 for queen + 2 bunk beds    Airbnb Bay Ridge Brooklyn - $370 for a 4 bedroom house (have messaged to find out if licensed and legal suspect not).    Broadway plaza - $340 for 2 x queen beds    Romer Hell‚Äôs Kitchen (newly reopened was Hampton) - $340 for 2 x queen beds + optional rollaway. I‚Äôm leaning towards this one but it‚Äôs so new there are very few reviews.    Thank you in advance :-)    And thanks to the person who already answered on the state forum! ,Wild Rumpus Travel,New York City,"Sheffield, United..."
Hi all we are due to leave this Saturday and want to get the subway and air train back to JFK for our 8pm flight. Would usually leave the hotel/area at 4pm to be at the airport for 5pm but would anyone advise us to leave any earlier with the UN delays?

Hi  In our day in the Adirondacks (October 2nd) we only have time (in addition to other things) for either High Falls Gorge or driving to the summit of Whiteface mountain.    What do you think is better more impressive which of them is a must?    If it matters I should mention that two days before we will visit Flume Gorge and one day before - Mount Washington and Cannon. Maybe it is not rellevant I just mention that.    Thank you very much in advance for your advice. ,Lord_Jade,Adirondacks,"Tel Aviv, Israel"

Before 2020 I remember tipping Uber was not expected. But since time has changed and with the new trend in tipping more and more is it customary to tip Uber or Lyft now in New York? If yes how much will be expected?    I searched this forum but most of the information is outdated. And some Googling shows opions like from Reddit but it seems that the opions are mixed. ,my w,New York City,Sweden
We are a family of 4 2 adults and 2 children (8&9). We will have 4 suitcases plus 2 small carry on cases. Will we fit in a flat fare cab at the airport or will we need a bigger cab? If so how much are the bigger cabs? Do they have a higher flat fare? Thanks! ,Carrie-Anne S,New York City,
Has anyone stayed at this hotel? Just wondering whether it is worth paying for a king room with city view. Our bus tour begins at this hotel but have 5 days prior to stay somewhere. So many reviews on hotels and feel over whelmed. Would want to visit Top of the rock Bryant park to view the famous restrooms free Staten Island ferry maybe a pedicab ride in Central Park grand central market and an evening cruise to see the city lights. Take in Times Square and maybe walk Brooklyn bridge and Dumbo. ,missvicki50,New York City,"Sydney, Australia"
Hello!    Coming to NYC Sept 29th - Oct 3rd and have visited previously.    This time around I booked two hotels Hotel Hugo and Heritage Hotel king beds. There is not much of a price difference between the two and it's just for 2 people. I was wondering which location would be better to stay at.    Some places that we are planning to go to are museums (The Whitney MOMA and Noguchi) restaurants (Tonchin Don Angie Win Son) Comedy Cellar and coffee shops/cafes (La Cabra Sey Librae). We are planning on getting a 7 day metro pass.    Thanks in advance!!! ,joyce k,New York City,San Francisco...

Hi    I am struggling to choose between different accommodations for our second trip to New York City.    We are a family of four and our kids will be 8 and 11. The kids are happy sharing a bed but if they can their own beds that is a bonus.    Our budget is ideally maximum $380 but we could go to $450 per night. We usually spend less but are stretching our budget because being a big amazing city NYC accommodation is more expensive.    Area wise we would like to be in central Manhattan or are considering staying in Brooklyn and getting to know that area better.    Last time we stayed at the Broadway Plaza Hotel. It was ok but our kids wake and eat breakfast early and the lack of proper tea making facilities and no restaurant meant breakfasts were a bit of a hassle. Ideally we‚Äôd like a kitchenette or some kind of on site cafe or restaurant where we can make or get breakfast without having to leave the hotel first thing in the morning.    Air conditioning (it‚Äôll be August and hot!) cleanliness and good wi-fi are a must. Size of the room view and multiple bathrooms are less important to us.    Options we are considering are below. I‚Äôd love your thoughts on location quality and value for money. Which would you choose to stay in?    Thanks so much.    James hotel - $500 per night for 2 x queen beds    AKA apartments NOMAD - $470 for 2 x double beds    Msocial Times Square - $430 for 2 x double beds    Radio city apartments - $390 for 2 double beds + sofa bed + kitchenette    Nu Hotel Brooklyn - $390 for queen + 2 bunk beds    Airbnb Bay Ridge Brooklyn - $370 for a 4 bedroom house (have messaged to find out if licensed and legal suspect not).    Broadway plaza - $340 for 2 x queen beds    Romer Hell‚Äôs Kitchen (newly reopened was Hampton) - $340 for 2 x queen beds + optional rollaway. I‚Äôm leaning towards this one but it‚Äôs so new there are very few reviews.    Thank you in advance :-) ,Wild Rumpus Travel,,"Sheffield, United..."

Hello. I‚Äôve been reading a lot of news about e bikes and batteries. We have purchased Pedego E-bikes. they use premium cells produced by reputable name brand suppliers such as Panasonic and Samsung.  We are heading to Nyc next summer for a few days before heading to the Cape. We will not be using the bikes in nyc  Our hope was to leave the batteries in our car and store the bikes inside a hotel. I have called a few hotels and they say no e bikes. They would allow bikes though. I‚Äôm thinking of calling back the hotels. What are your thoughts if I use this scenario? Would they agree to keep our bikes inside if we leave the batteries inside our car and transport the bikes inside? Would that be a legit request? ,Regal trips,New York City,"Columbus, Ohio"
Hi I am going to be sightseeing on my own while my husband has meetings and I haven't been to New York in a long time so would be grateful for some advice please. I have 3 days to myself in mid October and was thinking about doing a Chinese food tour. I am staying in Midtown (The Marmara) and it looks as though it is an hour's walk down to Chinatown. I enjoy walking around cities (London Paris etc) and wondered if this is a good idea in New York or if I would be better to get a cab down to Chinatown? I don't feel it would be sensible to get the subway on my own - is that being a bit paranoid though? Many thanks for any advice. ,Clare S,New York City,

Hi! Does the time chosen for entry into Summit One reflect the earliest that one can line up at security? For example if a ticket is purchased for 4:30 pm are you allowed to line up a the security line at 4:00 pm or does the 4:30 pm ticket mean line up at security no earlier that 4:30 pm?

We are planning a road trip next week starting in New Hampshire and driving to Niagara Falls. We thought it would be good to split the journey and do an overnighter on that 1st leg. We want to avoid any big cities or towns and happy to spend it somewhere small and quaint if that was an option? Any ideas welcome. (Looked at Sylvan beach Syracuse but unsure so open to any traveller tips).    Then the next day head to the falls border crossing etc. We have been told not to spend a night there so we are happy to spend a few hours and then move on our way We would then make our way up to Ottawa plan is to head to Montpelier (& White Mountain National Forest) before making our way back to NH. We have a week to get this done so we are easy with how long or short some parts of the journey can be so that we enjoy the places and aren't constantly on the road either.    We dont have to stick to this route it is what I put together using Google maps so if there's any pros or cons to what I'm suggesting I am happy to hear from others who know the areas well. We def would like to see Montpelier. Also any accommodation tips? I am surprised by how expensive everywhere is (of course I understand it is short lead time but I didnt get to planning in advance YIKES). Is driving and rocking up to places an option or far too risky? (I am an extensive planner believe it or not and for once when I haven't it seems I may have missed trick!)    Thanks in advance for any travel tips on this (We are travelling from Europe and will be there for 2 weeks just so you have an idea of our wider trip) flying in/out of Boston. ,LoveTravelVentures,Niagara Falls,"Cork, Ireland"

Hi I'm coming to NYC for the first time in two weeks.    I just wondered if this itinerary is doable. Entries with times are a booked ticket etc.    Day 1 - Arrive EWR 1400. Train to NY Penn then Metro line E to Queens Plaza to Hotel. Evening: Times Square (i.e. take a picture quick wander won‚Äôt hang around long)    Day 2 - Top of The Rock 0900 Intrepid Space Museum 1200 High Line    Day 3 - Statue Liberty (Crown Tour) 0900 9/11 Memorial 1300 Central Park    Day 4 - Transit Museum 1030 Then wander around Dumbo / Brooklyn Bridge    Day 5 - Gantry Plaza Park (ie Pepsi sign) then leave Queens approx. 1.30pm for 6pm flight.    Yes many early starts but I am too old for late nights now.    You can probably tell I like planes and trains a lot; hence two of these museums are featured.    I might try a Brooklyn show if I can get cheaper tickets on the day however not bothered. I am not a fan of musicals but like comedy. Will try Book of Mormon Play that goes wrong etc.    I probably sound uncultured but do not appreciate art very much hence I think I probably would not like Moma etc.    Thanks for any comments. ,Footprints826775,New York City,

Hello everybody!  I will be in New York during the Christmas season and I just received news that a dear friend has kindly offered us tickets to the Knicks vs Milwaukee Bucks on the December 25th at 12:00 pm.  It turns out that I had already purchased tickets for the Rocketes Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall on the same day at 10:00 am.  I've already checked and it's not possible to exchange the Rockettes tickets for another day so it looks like I'll have to go to both.  According to the information provided the Rockettes Show lasts 90 minutes so it will end around 11:30 am leaving us around half an hour to get to Madison Square Garden.  Is this doable or crazy? Do Knicks games usually start on time or are there slight delays? And if I arrive slightly late is there a problem?  Our seats are in section 201. Which entrance do you suggest to be faster?  Thank you all in advance. ,eniviv,New York City,Portugal

It was a little tedious finding hotels in Manhattan with two queen beds for $1K or less for two weekend nights but I did it :). Opinions about which is more well located for a Fall weekend if: arriving by train seeing Broadway show Central Park Rockefeller Center 9/11 Memorial?    First address is: 150 E 50th St  -First is a little roomier and I'm thinking maybe a little quieter    Second address is: 119 W 45th St  -Second is maybe a little nicer & maybe an easier walk to things ,ecccp,New York City,

I was planning all along (for a year) to stay at the New Yorker hotel b/c it was recommended by friends do things in NYC from there and simply take a taxi or car service to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal on the morning of my cruise on Sept 19. Now I have found out that the UN General Assembly is going to be gridlocking traffic all over NYC on the days I'm in town the 18th and 19th. I am not so worried about doing my touristy stuff but am incredibly worried about getting to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. The hotel recommended that I take public transport but as I am traveling solo and will have several bags that is really not a good solution for me. I am panicking and wondering if I should cancel my hotel and book one close to the cruise terminal. But that would then make it difficult to do the Met and Moma for which I already purchased tickets for the 18th. I've thought about hiring a car but that will still be stuck in traffic just as much as a taxi. I have a minor disability so the idea of taking all my luggage on the subway without ever having been on the NYC subway before is scary---although I've lived in DC 15 yrs and have taken luggage on that subway. many times even long distances. But NYC subway I know is a different beast. ,janebA188VA,New York City,Maryland

We are moving my daughter from Missouri to Vermont in October. I have always wanted to see Niagara falls but we will not have much time. On the way there we will have a trailer so I am guess that is out. We are much more into the view and nature than tourist stuff. We do have a passport. Would it be better for us to visit the canada or NY side? What is the best place to get a good picturesque view of the falls? What is the minimum time that is needed to do this on a Monday or Tuesday? ,Tina W,Niagara Falls,"Festus, Missouri"
Hi This is a strange question to ask and maybe only UK people who already live in New York or anywhere else in the USA may be able to help me with.    My daughter and her husband are re-locating jobs to New Jersey and I was going to send them a Christmas package of UK goodies nothin too big or heavy things like chocolate sweets crisps etc and was hoping someone could tell me what types of foods people who move to the USA miss having and can only seem to get in the UK ??  Thank you in advance. ,durie,,"Liverpool, United..."
Would anyone here know if Canadians can get an updated booster shot at a pharmacy in Buffalo? I'm flying out of Buffalo soon and Canada will not have it until late October. I've tried booking online and it will only accept a U.S. address. ,food wine fun,Buffalo,"Grimsby, Canada"
Hello. We are flying into LGA Oct 18th and staying 3 nights before we board our cruise. We have two tweens and a 1 1/2 yr old. We prefer not to lug a car seat and understand Ubers only offer fwd facing whereas the law requires baby to be rear facing until 2.    Looking for a hotel under $300/night for 5 people. We would do $400/night if it meant we could stay in a decent hotel in Manhattan. We currently have Home2Suites Island City booked because we couldn't find anything closer in our price range but am worried the transportation from LGA to Island City to Manhattan to the cruise terminal will be very complicated and expensive.    We are willing to do as much walking as our kids can handle and would like to avoid extremely crowded places as much as possible (don't want to get sick before the cruise). There are so many transportation options between hotel shuttles buses subways taxis Ubers and ferries it's overwhelming! Any assistance would be much appreciated! ,J Brown,New York City,"Louisville, Kentucky"

Hi    I'm Italian travelling to NY shortly. I checked my ESTA many times and all is correct. There's just one thing worrying me.  My city of birth is called Cento in the province of Ferrara. So on my passport I have --> Cento (FE).  I didn't write (FE) so my city of birth in the ESTA is just Cento.  Is this a mistake? The city is Cento the Esta question was the city of birth but it differs a little from the passport which shows some information more (the province).    Thanks a lot! ,Ilboy,New York City,

It will be my daughter and husband's first trip to NYC in mid October. I've narrowed it down to Moxy Timesquare or Courtyard by Marriott New York Manhattan / Midtown East. (Using my Marriott points).

Hey all    I know that there are a lot of questions asked about this type of thing but not sure of the best route as it is our first time with family.    There will be 2 adults and 2 kids with likely 4 suitcases (possibly 3 if it makes life easier).    Would we all fit in the one yellow cab or would we need to split into 2? My wife is a nervous traveller so if we need to split then we might be better off booking transfers so we can fit in one vehicle.    What would you recommend?    Thanks. ,Sighallgone,New York City,
My wife and I are coming from Australia to New York in December and I would love to see a NFL game as they look like a real spectacle.

Hi    I recently went to New York and accidently left my rucksack at the departure gate lounge.    The rucksack has been found by lost and found but the cost I have been told to send it back from New York to UK is ¬£175. The value of the contents is under ¬£10-¬£15 and because there is hardly anything in the rucksack it could probably be folded in half. I have looked at shipping but they are all triple the price of the contents. Need to item collected in the next 2 days as time limit on item being kept by lost and found but I don't need it shipped back quickly. A couple of weeks or more is fine. Don't have friends or relatives in New York so that's ruled out any other ideas.    Thanks ,Boatrip,,"Leeds, United..."

Please tell me if I'm being too ambitious. I have only one evening and one full day in NYC before a cruise. When I arrive it will be too late for museum hours and I'm thinking of maybe something like Top of the Rock and then a nice dinner. The next day I already purchased tix to Met and MOMA the plan being to take taxis between museums. Then I got interested in the. Met Cloisters as well. My Met ticket includes both but I see how far away they are. If I take taxis can I get to all 3 realistically during that short window they are open from 10 to 5? I can see how it would be a much easier better paced day to only do the MOMA and one of the Mets though. Is the Cloisters really only a 20 min drive from my hotel (The New Yorker hotel) or is that Google Maps forgetting to realize it's NYC traffic? I have no idea how reliable Google Maps is for NYC. Thanks. ,janebA188VA,New York City,Maryland
We are taking our 16yr old daughter to NYC for a whirlwind 1.5 days before we head upstate for a big family gathering. We‚Äôve been to NYC but it‚Äôs the first visit for our daughter so we told her she can pick the places she wants to see on this short visit. Here‚Äôs what we have:    Land around 9pm EWR Tuesday 10/3  Thinking cab or Uber to our hotel Hilton Midtown    We are flying from AZ so although it might be late when we check in we will be on AZ time & may be hungry & energetic enough to go get a late bite. I thought -maybe- we knock out Times Square to get the obligatory photos out of the way.    Wed AM:  I‚Äôm a foodie so I like the idea of a yummy sit down breakfast (need recommendations) but I also don‚Äôt want to take up too much of our sightseeing time. We aren‚Äôt opposed to grabbing bagels.    Daughter wants to see:  Central Park - just a few highlights this trip  Rockefeller Center  Shopping (Golf Wang store thrift stores etc)  9/11 memorial (not enough time for museum)  The Summit (sunset/dusk)    Since Golf Wang is not terribly far from Lombardis I thought maybe we could try to grab lunch there if the wait isn‚Äôt too long. If not still plan to grab pizza somewhere.    She wants to do the Summit at sunset/dusk. It‚Äôll be Oct 4th so I‚Äôm thinking of maybe buying tickets for 6pm to allow enough time to get through the lines & up by 6:45-7pm? Figure we‚Äôll stay there until 7:45-8pm    I plan to make late dinner reservations for Il Corso (for after Summit). It‚Äôs near our hotel & they have fettuccini alfredo on the menu a favorite of my daughters.    We can do some additional walking around after dinner and we‚Äôll have a few hours Thursday morning.    Our flight from LGA to BUF leaves at 2:30pm.  What time should I have a car pick us up? I wasn‚Äôt sure how much time to allow for traffic mid-day Thursday    In light of these stops & how far apart they are how would you lay out the itinerary?    Would you recommend taking the subway for the fastest route between stops or cabs?    Do you think we have time to do Central Park Thurs AM before our flight? (Im not opposed to hiring a pedicab if it helps get more in).    Shopping: other than Golf Wang my daughter isn‚Äôt interested in going to stores we have in Scottsdale. She‚Äôs interested in thrift clothing stores or small trendy shops that are unique to New York. Suggestions!    Thank you for your inputs! ,MommaCG,New York City,"Phoenix, Arizona"

Hi all we are due to arrive this Saturday (land at 4.20pm) and will take the air train from JFK to Jamaica station. From there we will take the subway and can either get one train with an 8 minute walk to sanctuary hotel or 2 trains with a 2 min walk. What would be best? The latter is a shorter walk through the busy streets with our cases but I‚Äôve no idea what the change entails (stairs etc) it‚Äôs from the E train to F train at Forest Hill‚Äôs if that helps. Would it be easier to just do the longer walk? Both journeys are fairly simple (for someone who has never been but expecting a very busy city on a Saturday late afternoon/early evening).

Which is better tourist destination between Empire State Building panoramic view and top of rock? ,Raj,New York City,
Settling back into normal life after a busy few weeks of traveling-I barely had time to get home and unpack before it was time to pack again for my second trip in a month!    Landed at LGA on Friday morning (one of the smoothest flights I've been on in a long time) and took the Q70 bus to the subway. Then got on the E train and took it all the way downtown to the World Trade Center stop and then just a quick walk to my hotel. I stayed at the Hotel Indigo Financial District and it was lovely-small room but perfect for my needs.    My room wasnt ready yet (I had requested a corner room with a view) so I dropped my bags and headed out to start my day. The weather was wonderful so I walked around Trinity Church for a little bit before heading to lunch. I debated taking the subway up to Greenwich Village but decided to walk since it was so nice out. Finally made it to Via Carota. I didnt have a reservation but they had an open seat at the bar so I didnt have to wait for a table. The cacio e pepe was delicious and hit the spot!    After lunch I walked over to the Whitney. This trip was full of firsts for me-I was determined to cross off some things that had been on my to-do list for a long time. Although I enjoyed it I was slightly underwhelmed possibly because 2 galleries were closed for installations. The first 2 exhibits I saw were photography pieces and photography just isn't my thing in art museums. I made it up to the 7th floor gallery and hit my stride-I especially loved the Georgia O'Keefe Edward Hopper and Andrew Wyeth pieces. And even though the 8th floor gallery was closed for an installation you could still visit the cafe and the outdoor patio area and the views from there were just spectacular! I think I enjoyed my time outside as much as I did inside!    After I left the Whitney I was heading back to my hotel to get checked in and freshen up. I walked back to Magnolia Bakery in Greenwich Village for some banana pudding to take back to my room. Decided to take the subway back downtown as my feet were getting tired and ended up getting slightly turned around trying to find the right subway station. After about 10 min of re-orienting my citymapper app I finally found the station I was looking for and got back to my hotel. Got checked in and rested my feet for a little bit before heading back out for the evening.    Walked across the street to the Rector St station and made my way to the Marquis theater for Once Upon A One More Time. I will say I wasn't quite sure what to expect since I really bought the ticket to see Justin Guarini but I ended up having so much fun! The choreography was fantastic and the show was really good! Got my playbill signed after the show and then headed to find some pizza for a late dinner.    I have made it somewhat of a tradition to get pizza and cheesecake after a show and Joe's on Broadway is usually my go to pizza place-got there and the people in front of me had counted the number of people in line and there were 110 ahead of us-they bailed and so did I! A quick google search found that there was a Joe's on Fulton St close to my hotel-it was a win win all around!    Enjoyed my pizza in bed and then crashed for the night! ,Tamara C,New York City,"Memphis, Tennessee"

What is a king bedroom ( type B) at the Arlo midtown it‚Äôs an extra ¬£192 but doesn‚Äôt say what‚Äôs the extra as the other is a king standard room ,jonathan d,New York City,
Hi guys    I got on here the other day to ask about rooms for a trip coming up in April and looked into all the recommendations. A lot still tipped over the budget with the conversion but I have held a few of those suggestions in hope the dollar will gain some momentu in the coming months.  My hubby did some research as well and he found some specials for 2 x rooms at Arlo Midtown and Nomad which came into our budget. I know that the rooms are small but as long as we have 2 they should be ok as we are early risers and won't be in room much.  Are their any pros and cons to these? I guess I really want to know which is the best area to be able to pop out for breakfast or drinks and have a few options. Also which has the best hotel bar as we like to have a little tipple before heading to dinner.  Thanks as always. ,Night,New York City,
We have utilized the services of Premier properties for three years renting homes in the Fingerlakes for summer vacations. Each year the services provided have declined.  This year we rented a home for a week. The website indicated that it was available from Sunday-to-Sunday but the office told us that it was rented Saturday-to-Saturday. We inquired on 3 diferent occasions to confirm the day of arrival and was told all three times that it was saturday.When we arrived there was a family already inhabiting the house until sunday. We contacted the office and after hours of delay were told to go to another house until sunday. We went the second house only to find that it was occupied also. After several more hours of delay we were sent to yet another lproperty on another lake - by this time it was night time. we had to unload our cars including 3 coolers of food.  The next day we had to re-pack the cars and wait until 4pm to get into the house that we originally rented. While looking at the key that they gave us we realized that the key was for a property on another lake and totally unrelated to our rental. We had to go to the office to return the key and get the correct key.  Premier Properties reimbursed us for one days rent but did not accomodate us for our inconvenience. They noted that the contract states (in clause 5) that they can make alternative arrangements if the need arises. We are not happy with the service provided by Premier Properties and will never use them again.  I highly recommend that you consider using another company as Premier Properties borders on incompetent and they are not easy to work with. ,bk20700,Penn Yan,"Columbus, Ohio"

Hi!    We are two adults and two children (8 and 11 years old) that are planning to visit New York in July 2024. The only period we have long vacation is in July so thats the only time we have a chance to visit New York.    We have understand that the temperature can get really hot in New York in July so not the best weather to explore Manhattan but we want to try :)    Our plan is to start the vacation 3-4 nights on Manhattan with sightseeing and after that we want to change focus to beach pool and relax for about 6-7 days.    Here comes our problem where do we go for beach pool and relax? We have no problem to rent a car to go to a place outside New York.    We have googled for days and now we need help :) We have found this:  1. Coney Island. Very close but is this a place where you spend 6-7 days? No pool here right? :)  2. Atlantic City long drive and not so suitable for children?  3. Ocean City seems nice but a long drive.    Would be so thankful for any advice you can give us :)    Thank you :) ,Anders Johansson,New York City,"Ystad, Sweden"

Next month will be my first visit to NYC in a few years and I will use my phone and OMNY for subway/bus. I arrive on Sunday and depart Friday. Under the old Metro Card rules any rides on Sunday would drop off and not count as of Sunday midnight. Looking at the MTA website I see no mention of this rule currently.    Can I therefore assume the new system (OMNY) is smart enough to begin (and end) a 7 day period regardless of the initial ride date? ,In25,New York City,Southwest Gulf...

My husband has finally said yes to NYC I have been several times and hoping he will love NYC as much as I do. I have done all the first-timers things several times and will do them again if he wants to. I am looking for a great area/hotel to stay in that will be close to the subway not far from all the Christmas fun which I know are spread throughout the city. In the past I have stayed in Midtown area but much closer to Times Sqaure (which he does not mind) but I'm looking for suggestions. There is not one particular area or attraction I feel we needed to be closer to since I plan on taking him everywhere. haha! I like the Upper West Side but on the lower end. I love the village area but thought that may be too far for walking to places and not as many options around there. I'd like to stay in the mid $300s. There are several hotels I have liked so far such as: The Jewel Lombardy Freehand Hyatt Place Midtown Bryant Park Hotel Riu Plazz Westgate Archer. I would appreciate any suggestions I know I'm probably all over the place. Thank you! ,Diane D,New York City,"San Antonio, Texas"

My wife and I spent 5 nights sightseeing in New York. Heres some first time visitor tips (some obvious) from a Brit but equally applicable to anyone I guess:    1. Spend some time drawing up an Itinerary of what you want to see and do. This is obvious but really essential. I built a spreadsheet with days as columns and rows marked - Breakfast AM activity Lunch PM activity Dinner Evening.  You can adjust the places to eat or activities depending on your daily mood but have a plan and dont just turn up is my advice. This forum is the best for advice and knowledge :-)    2. Google Maps is your best friend. Could never navigate our itinerary without it so advise installing it on your mobile device.    3. For UK travellers who dont have US roaming or high roaming prices with your mobile providers get yourself a Three pre-loaded PAYG data sim card. Its got 10GB of data unlimited calls/texts which you can use for 30 days from point of 1st use. At the time of writing this it costs ¬£10.  I advise going into a Three shop and purchasing rather than going on-line. A few days before your trip pop it into your phone and activate it. Really easy and you can use it as if you were in the UK. Yes you‚Äôll have a new number while using it which is a minor inconvenience. I hammered the sim card and only used around 4GB out of the 10 over 5 days.    4. Taxi or Train into Manhattan? Because we had time and our flight times were favourable we took the train to our hotel. Its relatively easy. Once out of customs follow the Air Train signs - you want the Jamaica station stop (they all go there). You then need to pay $8.25 each at the ticket machine on the sides to get through the turnstile. Add $1 to that if you‚Äôre purchasing a new Metrocard which we did because of my next point.  I cant offer advice on getting a taxi as we didnt get one but i believe its a flat rate into Manhattan - there are posts on this throughout this forum    5. As our hotel was pretty close to a subway station and we‚Äôd be using this throughout our visit we topped up our metrocards with the 7-day unlimited travel pass for $33 each. I wanted to keep travel stuff separate from my credit cards so opted for the Metrocard. Think of it like an Oyster card back in the UK.  You‚Äôll need to look up the nearest stations to your respective hotels but its easy. The biggest issue you‚Äôll have is that some subway and main stations do not have lifts (elevators) or escalators. This means dragging your luggage up and down lots of stairs as we found out at 7th Av station. So be very weary of that.  I believe the break even point of a 7 day metrocard pass is if you do 12 subway trips which we comfortably smashed. And one thing here there are no zones like London. Its one same ticket fee per journey irrespective of where you get off. You only need to swipe your card entering a station    6. I cant advise on a hotel because people have different tastes budgets locations etc.  For what its worth we stayed at The Carnegie Hotel just off 7th Ave which was in a great location. 2 subway stations close by about 3 blocks from Central Park about 10 min walk straight into Times Square and lots of eating places within a couple of blocks. The rooms aren‚Äôt big though and its not the cheapest place but it didnt break the bank either. We paid $1200 inc taxes for our 5 nights    7. Sightseeing passes - we didnt purchase any although we would have saved some money in hindsight. But again plenty of advice in this forum regarding those.    I hope you found this post useful. We had an absolute blast in New York - absolutely loved the city as a tourist and depending on your itinerary you will smash your step count. We averaged 25k per day. Enjoy and happy to answer any questions if I can ,G Singh,New York City,West Midlands...

My brother T called Monday Aug 28 ‚Äúmy wife can‚Äôt go do you want to go to the US Open on THURSDAY?‚Äù. Had been looking for a chance any chance to get to NYC and this was perfect opportunity. Except I was booked to fly to sister‚Äôs to house/dog-sit that Saturday. But there was a little wiggle room so I scrambled to change flight from DFW->ABQ->DFW to DFW->NYC->ABQ->DFW. Was pleased/surprised how easy it was to accomplish and the change in airfare was within reason. American Airlines.    T had a 230pm LGA arrival my arrival 229pm. Both flights were early his from Houston arrived before me. Easily met up at LGA shared cab into town. Off to a good start.    T staying at Hilton Midtown 6th and 54th (the USTA hotel). Me being the bargain-seeker (cheapskate?) booked La Quinta Times Square South 38th between 8th/9th Aves. $1250 all-in for four nights on Booking.com. Bit of a walk. More on this later.    The La Quinta was clean great bed and pillows *cold* a/c. But a small room (not sure 2 ppl would fare well) hardly any plugs and the block is not interesting at all. The included breakfast was decent enough but the breakfast room was as small as the hotel room so it was tolerable but not exactly pleasant.    T is a long-time USTA Volunteer/Committee member etc. so we were able to take the USTA Bus from Hilton Midtown to BJKTC. Our plan was to go Friday night Saturday night and Sunday afternoon.    A word about transit. From my hotel to brother‚Äôs was walkable unless you‚Äôre in a hurry. Tried to take a taxi once or twice both times the drivers took 7th thru Times Square. This was the seventh level of Hell especially at night. Never ever take a cab near Times Square. Walk subway learn to shoot spiderwebs like Spider-Man anything but a taxi.    Arrival Day Thursday. T had booked Mercato for dinner which happened to be right behind my hotel. Since we were early we first stopped at Irish bar Scallywag. What I love about NYC Irish Bars is the staff is always‚Ä¶Irish. Feels like a little overseas trip. Then on to Mercato. I liked it ok (seafood soup was good not great) but brother loved it. I did enjoy the ambiance very much. Would happily return but stick with a pasta dish.    https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d5848021-Reviews-Scallywags_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html  https://www.mercatonyc.com/    Friday. Had lunch reservation at Minetta Tavern. We walked from Hilton Midtown to the restaurant 50+ blocks whew! Had the M.T. Burger I‚Äôd heard so much about enjoyed it very much although at the end of the day it was just‚Ä¶a hamburger. Loved the French fries which NYTimes recently wrote an article about hope the link works. Drank at least 8 glasses of water.    Minetta Tavern (http://minettatavernny.com)    https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/dining/best-french-fries-nyc.html?unlocked_article_code=ngfjPDCktwmYLceHQbpjX3459VnDm1wrK63z-58m75hkgvAdf5Gl_kUCR9LMc_1J31I81WMZaqicO4hL3l5_4D4fjK6255QPtPstka-sZVJnpk3aUipzsXi5rnaQcQKRl8zGU27415JFHCpIMHUP-unFIRd9yj-JIGIHFYwQ6KdGXhhnkHXGNFTpLG5f_afb3FF_k9_kLRXsGc1jdzv56kwrv73aV1XpEePUi70Nbu5YuMmT0NojEfLUlKPTayAW1oDtExl4rRi9reEAUhP8M80ElRtr5Z9cRsnVR5-J_2AW9YVkUpcX6qBlPCVTCaECutFnrB1pEDNB2k2Kk5Y&smid=url-share    Subway back as we‚Äôd had enough walking for the day. Headed to the open around 5pm. The USTA bus is great but it seems they don‚Äôt always run the full a/c and of course there‚Äôs street traffic. I suspect the 7 train would be faster and cooler.    Got a picture of Brad Gilbert and Mary Jo Fernandez standing about 10 feet away. Walked past Coco Gauff without realizing it. We know this because security paused one in our group then the line of kids we‚Äôd just passed started shouting ‚ÄúCoco!‚Äù. That night we watched Taylor Fritz / J Mensik match which Fritz won in straight sets. We had tickets to Arthur Ashe stadium where Djokovic was playing but they were nosebleed so we didn‚Äôt go. I regret that.    Saturday we originally booked lunch at favorite The Dutch but last minute opted for Chinese at Ziggy‚Äôs recommended Uncle Lou‚Äôs in Chinatown. Very nice ambiance looked like a new restaurant. I had a long-running joke with T about eating shrimp at the Open (long story) but the joke turned out to be on me as he ordered the Jumbo Shrimp with Scallions which had the biggest I mean *huge* tastiest shrimp ever. I had Kung Pao shrimp which had plenty of shrimp but miniature compared to the Jumbo. How I wish I‚Äôd ordered what he ordered.  https://www.unclelounyc.com/    Afterward we decided to visit Chelsea Market. It was insanely crowded so much that we wanted to leave almost as soon as we entered although we did manage to get a latte and pastry and sit down to enjoy. I don‚Äôt know if the crowd was a Labor Day thing or if that‚Äôs just usual Chelsea market. It appears the cookware store which I‚Äôd hoped to visit is no longer there.  https://www.chelseamarket.com/    Back to the Open Saturday night. Initially the major venues all had lines so we spent some time on the smaller courts watching women‚Äôs doubles which is great fun because you are nearly standing on the court. If you go don‚Äôt miss the small courts and the practice courts. Ended up on Court 17 to watch women‚Äôs singles Peyton Stearns beat Katie Boulter. We took particular interest since it turns out Peyton Stearns is also a University of Texas alum.    Sunday for lunch decided to go to Premier Deli near his hotel since my brother remembered enjoying it from previous trip. We split a Reuben and honestly it was good as anything I‚Äôd eaten on this trip. Their coleslaw and potato salad are fantastic a little creamy just like I like them.  http://premierdelicafe.com/    We went to the Open for the afternoon session. Sunday was the day it turned hot in NYC so it was pretty awful. We watched some mixed doubles in the shade in the Grandstand but headed back into town relatively soon.    Sunday night was dinner at Mastro‚Äôs Steakhouse booked largely I think based on proximity to T‚Äôs hotel. Of course I had to get there from 38th in nicer clothes on the subway on a hot day. Blech. On the platform I had to choose between waiting for the right train E and the air conditioning in the arriving A train. Not really a decision. The A took me further than I wanted (59th) but at least I had a few minutes of air conditioning.    Back to Mastro‚Äôs Steakhouse. Not a good experience. Our waiter was nowhere to be found most of the evening and the juicy porkchop I anticipated turned out to be overcooked and dry even though I asked for it to be cooked however the chef considered best. The $30 shrimp cocktail I‚Äôm betting was frozen shrimp. They serve it in this smoking dry-ice presentation I think maybe to mask that it‚Äôs frozen shrimp. There were other issues this restaurant was a fail overall. I will say the before-dinner drinks were *great* and the Wedge Salad was good although a little weird (chopped not wedge and soooo much bacon (too much bacon can that be a bad thing?)).  https://www.mastrosrestaurants.com/location/mastros-steakhouse-new-york/    Monday was fly home day from LGA. I suspected taxi to LGA on Labor Day at 8 in the morning would be smooth sailing which it was. A nice change from the traffic-battling of the previous few days.    A great trip no downtime whatsoever but you never cover as much as you expect or think you should. I always think ‚Äúoh four days I‚Äôll be able to see *everything*!‚Äù and at the end of the trip it‚Äôs always ‚Äúwhere did the time go?‚Äù. That‚Äôs NYC for you. ,LarryD,New York City,"Dallas, Texas"

We have a bit of time as we hit NYC the first week of April for 5 nights. I am generally a very organised traveler and like to square things away early but with the dollar as it stands I am holding a few hotels on pay later hoping some deals come up closer.  We have two very large 16 year olds who are over 6ft so we need some space. We stayed at Doubletree Times Square back in the day when they were little (with 3rd child) and found that very cramped at the time so not really looking for that type of set up. We had decided to book 2 x hotel rooms but as the dollar creeps lower our choices get slimmer. We currently have 2 x rooms at Margaritaville held (kids choice as they really want Times Square) and also looking at a few others around that price point in Midtown and Chelsea but these are creeping up to about 8K mark.  I stumbled up the City Club Duplex room which is thousands cheaper and it seems to be in a good location and gives us a lot of extra space even if it is considered one room.  The reviews just seem so damn mixed though. I am not an incredibly fussy.. I want a clean room comfortable bed central location with breakfast locations close by. Our itinerary has me wanting to have dinner in 5 different parts of town in each direction so midtown probably is a good fit..plus my husband is pretty determined to stay around this area too.  Has anyone stayed at Central Club and have thoughts? I really don't mind too much about things being older I just really want clean and great location  Also if anyone could recommend anything similar I am pretty open to suggestions?  Thanks ,Night,New York City,

Hello! We are coming to NYC with our family of 5 for a few days next summer and I am hoping to keep our food costs to around $40-50 per person per day for most days. We went to Europe this past summer and really enjoyed just buying food at local markets and cheap eats type places - just super affordable gyros pizza panini shared charcuterie boards etc. We did a few more splurgy sit-down meals but they were among our least favorite meals actually.    I'm assuming NYC will be less affordable than that so please hit me with your best suggestions for saving money on food! We are planning on staying at a hotel with breakfast included so we will probably do that most days. And how difficult/easy is it to find a meal for under $15 per person? Happy to wander down some side streets away from the main sites to save some money on food as long as it's not terribly out of the way. We're staying in kind of Midtown Manhattan and tentative plan is to spend one day in the upper part - Central Park etc. two days in the Midtown area and probably 2 days in lower Manhattan so all suggestions welcome!    Thanks! ,Katie,New York City,Alaska
Hi    I have a couple of questions. We're staying at the Hotel Beacon and will be flying out of JFK at 7pm Saturday 14th October. We will have too much luggage to make the subway/air train viable so will use a car service. I've searched and older threads suggest to allow 1hr45 to JFK at that time is that still the case (the results I was getting were from well before covid)? So leaving the UWS at say 2.15pm/2.30pm for a 7pm flight? It's an international flight we will have checked luggage but will be flying business which I think will mean fast track security. We;ve not flown through the states since covid.    The other question relates to getting to the ferry at E90th. Google maps shows a walking time of just under an hour with the bus taking about 40 minutes inc walking at either end. We plan to be at the ferry at around 9am on the Friday morning so I'm wondering whether that bus time is going to push right out in rush hour. If so we will likely walk since there's not an enormous amount in it anyway and we like to stretch our legs but it would be useful to know in case the weather is bad. Uber is an alternative in bad weather but obviously the traffic will be just as bad so doesn't seem much point though if I'm wrong on that please do say.    If we do walk does anyone have any suggestions for a grab and go breakfast along the way? I'll google as well of course.    Thanks in advance! ,Clare C,New York City,

We were in the city yesterday and had planned on getting some bagels near the Port Authority but with the heat we forgot and just wanted to get back to our hotel in NJ. Are there any bakeries here that would sell New York style bagels? We‚Äôre near the American Dream mall at the Holiday Inn. We‚Äôre also going to Ocean Grove today so anything on the west would work too. Thanks. ,travellingbook,New York City,Canada

After just watching the video we created after that trip I returned here to see if my post from 13 years ago was still up. I was so happy to see our original post was still included in the trip reports:    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k3617814-Traveling_to_NYC_on_vacation_with_small_children-New_York_City_New_York.html    Our kids are now 16 14 and 13. They've now visited nearly every state in the U.S. and 39 countries. And of course we've returned to NYC three additional times -- The Big Apple will always be one of our favorite places to vacation.    Since we travel so much people always ask us for advice. We tell everyone to visit the city. Flights from South Florida where we live are cheap. Reasonable hotel rates are available if you know where look. It's the best foodie location in the world. Most of all there is so much to do and see.    I think it's time for us to plan another trip to NYC. It just sucks about AirBnb's. ,Andrew W,New York City,Coral Springs...

I  am coming to NYC later this month. I travelled via the US last summer and so have an existing ESTA. However as I was only in transit on my last trip this is listed on my application:  Is your travel to the US occurring in transit to another country? Yes    Does this mean I should apply for a new ESTA as I will not be in transit this time or will I be ok?    Thanks for any help and advice :0) ,Sakina W,New York City,

Hi there I‚Äôm planning my first visit to the Tenement Museum on Sept 17th. It seems their tours have changed with the re-opening of 91 Orchard.

It‚Äôs our first time in NYC and probably our last. We are in our mid 60‚Äôs and in good health. I‚Äôbe been looking at many hotels near Times Square. I‚Äôve even called a few. We will be heading there for at least two nights on our way to Cape Cod. We‚Äôve booked a day trip on Discover NY Tour (Closed-Top Bus) with USA Guided Tours for one of those days. We meet at 770 7th Ave  We will spend $350+ per night  We will have bikes on the back of the car and will need to store them inside the hotel.  We would prefer a hot breakfast or at least a grab and go included and self parking No less than a 3 star hotel  I‚Äôve looked at The Pearl RenaissanceHampton inn KimptonHotel Theta SheratonMargaretiville (spelling is off)  And Are higher floors in the hotel necessary?

Just wondering if anyone has a chart or list of date ranges where hotel costs are the most expensive and least? (sort of like a crowd calendar for disney haha). I know December tends to be pricey and maybe Jan-Mar cheaper but unsure about the rest of the months. Or... maybe city events that always cause a rise in prices for that time period. ie. marathon etc.    I was trying to find a cheap hotel for 10/20 because my kid's FIT family day is 10/21 that I want to attend without having to get up at 5:30am to get the train and I was surprised prices are so high that night. That's what made me think maybe there's a chart/list out there somewhere.    Thanks! ,caroline1851,New York City,Connecticut

Our family has been to Manhattan multiple times. We've stayed in Midtown UWS FiDi East and West Villages so we're pretty familiar with the food scene except we're foodies so we tend towards a slightly higher caliber of restaurant. My son wants to go to Manhattan for his 15th birthday (early November) which great sign us up except he's put in a special request. He ONLY wants to do tacky tourist stuff (think Madame Tussauds) and eat at tacky tourist restaurants. The tacky tourist destinations I can manage but I need help finding some unicorns. Does anyone have any recommendations for restaurants that qualify as a tacky tourist destination but where the food isn't lackluster? We're staying in Flatiron this time around but will be all over the place (from Central Park down to the Battery) so anything is a go. No cuisine limits no price limits just an over-the-top New York tourist experience. What can I say my kid has an odd sense of humour. ,Saphron,New York City,

We have nothing solid yet but intending to visit in later '24.  We had been planning for August at first because we were considering a short New England and Canada cruise at the end of our visit- the cruise began in early September.  I've been reading that September is more expensive for accommodation which is why we'd chosen to stay in NYC before rather than after the cruise.  But now we're considering just making it a NYC visit for around 2 weeks and putting a cruise on a later list.  So now we've changed our minds a bit- what do regulars recommend? Should we keep planning for August or switch to October instead?  Open to any suggestions.  Thanks. :) ,centralvic,New York City,"Ballarat, Australia"
Hi! We will be in NYC during the busy month of December. Travelling as a family of 5 (mom dad and three teens). This will be the first time in NYC for my husband and children and seeing one show is on the list of things to do. While everyone is very excited about the trip I would not say the three boys are not as excited about seeing a Broadway show as my daughter and I are. My dilemma is whether or not to go ahead and purchase tickets in advance or wait a bit and try to use TheaterMania BroadwayBox or TodayTix (maybe even day of rush tickets)? Purchasing five halfway decent tickets in advance to a show like &Juliet or Back to the Future in December will be over $900.00. Definitely willing to spend the money to have the experience but if there is a chance to purchase discount tickets for a family of five that might be a better way to go. Has anyone successfully (meaning been able to purchase decent tickets together or close together) purchased show tickets closer to the show date or day of? We are not set on a certain show just needs to be a show that will appeal to teens. Thank you! ,TravellingKelly99,New York City,
I will be traveling through NYC on my way from Poughkeepsie to Newark Airport. I prefer to travel this segment of my trip by train. Unfortunately I need to be at the airport by 2 pm so none of the direct trains will work. According to the Amtrak website the earliest I could arrive at the airport by a direct train would be 3:57pm. That means that I need to make a connection at Penn Station. I don't want to travel to another station by cabsubway or bus since I will have luggage. The trains that I could take from Poughkeepsie to NYC (Penn Station) would arrive at either 10:15 am or 12:24 am. I can buy the tickets for those trains in advance and even reserve a seat.    What is the easiest way to get from Penn Station to Newark Airport by train with luggage? The NJ Transit website doesn't seem to allow me to buy tickets in advance. Do I need to wait until I get to Penn Station to buy them? I will be in NYC earlier in my trip. Could I buy them in person then? As a last resort can I buy them on board the train? Most importantly how much time should I allow for transport issues such as buying tickets or common transit delays?    As a backup how easy is it to get a taxi to Newark Airport and is there anyway to estimate the cost of that? ,budget_travelz,New York City,Southern California

Hi my husband and I are looking to travel from the UK around 22nd March 2024 for 6 nights.    The prices I am seeing are around ¬£1000pp including flights.  I think that works our $200-250 before Aby fees paid locally.  Hotels I have liked the look of so far are Innside Melia (great reviews and stayed in Melia elsewhere) Royalton Park Lane (pool and rooftop bar and large rooms) iberostar Park Lane (decent sized rooms good reviews)  And a bit different the Rui Plaza as it has breakfast included for the same price.  Any thoughts on the above or ideas of similar type hotels. Looking for something that feels a bit nicer than budget  not tiny rooms restaurant on site so we could get breakfast some days gym bonus.  Any ideas welcome. Thanks in advance. ,Poohbearfan,New York City,"Rayleigh, United..."
Another Upstate NY Road trip report this time to the Cooperstown Area    If you have ever seen my posts You might know I am a big Mets and Baseball fan I was not able to get to the Baseball Hall of fame when I went Upstate last month so this Labor Day Weekend I went to the Cooperstown Area    Friday I left Queens and my first stop was Pratt Rocks Pratt Rocks is the NY Mount Rushmore (Only if you belive it or not) Its some carving that was the First civil war monument in the US. Zadok Pratt Made these carvings in a rock in the Catskills Mountains. Honestly wasnt really worth it but it was free and it was basically on the way to Cooperstowns    On the wat to Secret caverns  my next stop I saw a Covered Bridge It was the Bleinheim Covered Bridge the Bridge was actually washed out during Hurricane Irina in 2011 and the Bridge was rebuilt    My next stop was Secret Caverns Howe Caverns is of course more famous but I had been there before so I decided to go to nearby Secret Caverns which is sort of an Off Beat Underground cave that contains a 100 foot waterfall underground I had never been to Secret caverns so I thought I try it out it was pretty cool but in My opinion was a little overpriced it was $20 a person (and I had a $2 coupon( but the 100 foot waterfall was still cool    The last stop for the day was Glimmerglass State Park Glimmerglass state Park was the former Hyde Estate on the Northern End of Lake Otsego Having been to a bunch of upstate Lakes this summer (Mirror Placid and George) Otsego was a little different as its more like a finger Lake. The Hyde Mansion on the park overlooks Lake Otsego Also in the Park is the Oldest covered Bridge in the US the Bridge and Mansion date from around 1827. There is a beach on the lake. The Park is a nice Park and the Mansion tour was good It was $15 to tour the Mansion.    Saturday I stayed in town about 10 Minuets from downtown Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame. I walked Around town being I had a little extra time I really walked around town and even saw a wild Garter Snake (I dont mind seeing most things in the Wild but I dont like seeing Snakes even if its a Garter Snake) Among the places I saw in Cooperstown was an old Stone Bridge  The source of the Susequana River the longest river east of the Mississippi which begins at Lake Otsego they had a couple of fairs for Labor Day Weekend. I also walked around the shops in Cooperstown Many of the shops themselves are almost museums My final stop was the Heroes of Baseball Wax Museum I debated to go here or not as the reviews were not so hot but in the end I went It wasnt worth it they had about 30 wax figures and I spent about an hour there. Most of it watching a video on baseball bloopers. I walked around the village too the Village is great to walk around as its pretty much been preserved (likely due to all the tourist money coming in) and really is itself a destination which makes The Baseball Hall of Fame the best of the Halls to visit    My last day today Sunday I went to the Baseball Hall of Fame at 9am It was a good time to go It was pretty empty (It got busier Later). On tripadvisor the museum really doesnt have any negative reviews the only Negative revews of the Hall of fame seem to be people who either dont Like Baseball or had some other stupid reason (Like one person didnt like the village of Cooperstown and gave the Hall One star for that). If you are a baseball fan you obviously gotta go to the Hall. Admission is $28 to the Hall totally worth it if you are a baseball fan everyone I saw there was really having a great time    The last stop before going home was a Cruise on Lake Otsego on the Glimmerglass Queens. This summer I went on Cruises at Lake Placid and Lake George so I figured Id go on the One on Lake Otsego. Wasnt a bad cruise It was $19 which was slightly cheaper than the ones at Lake Placid and Lake George  but honestly it wasnt as interesting While the lake was nice there isnt a whole lot around it it was plesant.    It was then time to go home but wouldnt you know it While Driving through Delhi NY I saw a civil War Monument and stopped to get some photos.    I couldnt figure out what direction waze was taking me home so I just went back the way I knew how and thats to take route 28 from Oneonta to Kingston and then the Thru-way (In the end I took the Thruway to the Tappen Zee Bridge (We do not call that bridge by any other name) to the Sprain Brook      Pictures to come shortly as I have alot ,Queenstravelbuff,,New York City

I'm doing a fall colors trip through Maine New Hampshire and Vermont over a week. Unfortunately I only have a day to drive through some of the scenic routes in the Adirondacks before heading to Boston International Airport for a domestic flight at 8:30pm. I would like to know what routes I should definitely travel among the following and what I can afford to skip. I can't do all of them in a day since I have a 4h drive to Boston from Lake George.    1. Route 28/28N (North Creek - Newcomb - Long Lake - Blue Mountain Lake - Indian Lake - North Creek)  2. Route 30/3 (Long Lake - Tupper Lake - Saranac Lake)  3. Route 86/73 (Saranac Lake - Lake Placid - Cascade Lake - Keene Valley - Underwood)  4. Route 84 (Newcomb - North Hudson)  5. Route 9N (Along Lake George)  6. Prospect Mountain Summit    Ideally I would like to drive in a loop so that I don't travel the same road twice. I will be staying at a hotel in Plattsburgh the earlier night. From what I've researched routes 86/73 and 84 are must-do. How can I incorporate some of the other routes into my itinerary so that by the end I'm driving south on I-87 and then to I-90 towards Boston airport? ,Tejas A,Adirondack,
Hi all  I am travelling from Delaware with my mother and need to drop her to Terminal 4. I was able to get a good deal at Terminal 8 parking lot but was not sure of how to go about things after. so I have 2 questions and really appreciate if someone can assist.    1. Should I just get the blue parking lot - is there a way we can get some discounts on parking as I see they are charing like $60 for 3 hours whereas terminal 8 is charing $35    2. If i pick terminal 8 for above reason I see an option of Airtrain  but not sure of how far it is. Secondly my mom is only passenger so i need to ensure - I check her in and do all necessary formalities. Will I be allowed to travel in Airtrain if I am not travelling/dont have any tickets in hand.    Thanks in advance. ,Imran M,New York City,"Bear, Delaware"
Hello  It is worth visiting Bronx Zoo in December? I woud definitely like to visit but I'm worried because of winter the experience won't be that good. ,Marko H,New York City,"Solkan, Slovenia"
We are coming to New York at the end of October and have come across The Gregorian as a possible stay but we can‚Äôt find any reviews on Trip advisor. Has it recently been renovated? I wondered if anyone could tell me more about it - we like the location and it looks in our price range (which is ¬£250 or less per night!) At the moment it‚Äôs either this or the Hilton Garden Inn down in the financial district. Not the ideal location I know but hits the right budget!  Thanks in advance ,Bev P,New York City,"Rayleigh, United..."
Do any Manhattan hotels have club or executive lounges open these days? We'd prefer a Marriott Hilton or Hyatt property but we're open to others. We have previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt and Marriott Marquis but I understand their lounges haven't reopened after COVID.    Any recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you. ,ryandk,New York City,"Vancouver, Canada"

I'm travelling with a young family of five and have the following itinerary. We are specifically seeking a hotel or input on the part of the City we should focus on for the following requirements:  1. Best positioned for these attractions we are planning on using as weekdays on the subway rush hour are a concern.  2. Hotels must be preferably with the Bonvoy (Marriott/Sheraton) chain or as a second choice Best Western. Highest we will pay is 600 a night approximately.  3. Close to great breakfasts (must have NYC bagels) and dinners (pastrami cheesecake dessert pizza and any other must have NYC food to try) is a bonus.  4. Preferably a hotel that has live entertainment in the lobby at night or in a family friendly nearby establishment.  5. Okay to walk in the early evening up until 8 pm nearby the hotel.  6. Great views a bonus.    Day 1 Wed  Empire State Building  Day 2 Thurs  Statue of Liberty  Day 3 Friday  American Museum of Natural History  Day 4 Saturday  Top of the Rock Observation Deck and Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises ,Rick W,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"
Almost time to be there - i have 3 hotel reservations that i can cancel soon - I think im sticking with Arlo Midtown Hotel - the cleanest of all the reviews..    for the tickets when I google citypasses there are too many options is it better timeframe wise with the citipasses or is the same line for everyone?    we are planning:  top of the rock  summit one  statue of liberty island  museum of natural history    is there one city pass with all the above entrances? ,GFlorida79,New York City,
I mucked up and didn‚Äôt book my husband‚Äôs 60th birthday meal for end of October when reservations opened 2 days ago at Le Bernardin. And now the only option is stupidly late‚Ä¶  So are there any other recommendations for a really special dinner? (We‚Äôre both vegetarian but not vegan) ,VegieMel,New York City,

There are so many questions about what to do on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in NYC I uploaded some photos to share some ideas.  Obviously there are many other things to do. Here are some photos of my favorites    Christmas Day 2022 -  Bryant Park -  https://bryantpark.org/activities/holiday-shops  Holiday Shops  Winter Village's charming holiday market in the heart of NYC    My photos -  https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Profile/onemoreroad/MediaBatch/12171339?tab=photos  It was fun to shop at the holiday market watch the skaters at the rink and the kids on the carousel. You can reserve a warm spot to sit and eat in the Igloos.  https://bryantpark.org/activities/cozy-igloos    Bryant Park skaters -  https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Profile/onemoreroad/MediaBatch/12171381?tab=photos      After a couple of hours at Bryant Park we were off (via taxi) to our late lunch at Le Grande Boucherie.  Tip = Make reservations on OpenTable or Resy so you have your Christmas Day meal pre-arranged.      After lunch it was off to the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular to see the Rockettes the camels and Santa's arrival -  https://www.rockettes.com/christmas/?cmp=sem_googleads_radiocity&utm_campaign=onsale&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=googleads&gclid=CjwKCAjw3dCnBhBCEiwAVvLcu5HPrs6km-SE9tqlLMWOho80vipwhk6_23OLWYs5Aa_V22frSlPwkxoCrUAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds    More photos -  https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Profile/onemoreroad/MediaBatch/12171345?tab=photos    After the show it was off to see the wonderful Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.  https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/  I do suggest you visit the tree before Christmas Night. The crowds were tremendous and it was hard to navigate through the crowds.  I like to go on an earlier day to see the tree in daylight watch the skaters shop a little etc.    Earlier in the trip we strolled to see the store windows visited Macy's and favorite shops enjoyed the holiday market at Union Square and enjoyed the festivities of Manhattan decorated for the holidays.  http://www.usqholiday.nyc/  Nov 16 to 24 -  http://www.usqholiday.nyc/guide    For Christmas Eve it was a nice meal out and a Broadway musical.  Christmas Eve dinner at Rue 57  https://rue57.com    So many more options. These are just the things we chose to do last Christmas. ,onemoreroad,New York City,Georgia

Hi I'll be staying in NY (Wall St area) the week of Halloween I'd like to maybe do one day trip out of the city to see something different I've never been anywhere else in North America I was just in NYC once again last year. Do you have any suggestions for a place that would be max 1.5/2hrs train away from the city? We aren't planning to get a car so it must be somewhere easy to reach with public transport and ok to explore by foot once we are there. Would love to see some typical small village historical town or fall landscapes/nature/foliage anything that you think would be worth seeing thank you so much for your advice :) ,LilJulie,New York City,"Dublin, Ireland"
Just flying back to Canada from our fabulous trip to NYC and thought I‚Äôd share what we did. And we did A LOT! My daughter is 18    Nyc Day 1- Sat Aug 26  Landed at 4:10pm - level 1 to get metro card - back to level 2 to get taxi - less than 40 min to get to the Hotel Belleclaire on the UWS- cleaned & showered - walk to empire hotel for a Paloma for me and we split a tiny plate of 8 wings =$50US. Not worth it TBH. The view wasn‚Äôt that great and it just seemed overpriced. We walked around UWS saw the Dakota building. Stopped at Fairway Market and CVS for supplies/snacks. Back at the hotel by 8:30pm. Kiddo was exhausted from being up at 5am. Over 14k steps.    NYC day 2- Sunday  Left hotel at 9:40am - we are fans of Only Murders in the building so we walked to the Belnord (aka The Arconia) - very cool!! shopped at Purdy Girl - great little shop- walked to Grand Bazaar and thrifted for a bit as that was something my daughter really wanted to Left market around noon - back to hotel to drop off bags. Picked up sandwiches at Amsterdam market which were super tasty. Walked through Central Park : bow bridge Bethesda terrace mall & literary walk to the plaza on 5th Trump tower Tiffany‚Äôs Uniqlo Abercrombie. Subway back to hotel freshen up - out again to go to Broadway show. We were rushed so just went to Gray‚Äôs Papaya for couple of hot dogs & drink. Subway to Lena Horne theatre to see Six. Grteat show but it‚Äôs super short!! Times Square for literally 10 min then we left bc the kiddo absolutely hated it. She hates crowds and gets easily over stimulated. We were then off to Junior‚Äôsfor cheesecake. Back to hotel. over 23k steps. This was a little too much walking - I should have booked a pedicab for CP.    NYC day 2- Monday  Headed down to Rockefeller Centre and looked around. Did way more shopping than I thought we would.  Grand central -we weren‚Äôt there very long which kind of surprised me.. Kid wasn‚Äôt that interested. Went to the NYPL- one of my favorites!! Fantastic shop inside and we found our souvenir ornament that resembles the lions outside. We used Bryant Park public bathroom (it‚Äôs gorgeous!) We had lunch in Bryant Park and sat for nearly an hour - ordered lunch through door dash from the Pr√™t √† Manger across the street. Loved how easy it was! More shopping. Walked to Penn Station and got the subway back to the hotel. Got back around 3:45. Chilled out in the hotel for a few hours to recharge. Dinner at New Cottage at Broadway and 78th- really tasty!! Ordered Szechuan shrimp dumpling spring roll beef Lo mein soup dumplings. We then hopped on e-bikes to Pier 78 to catch the Ferry to Staten Island via St George terminal at 7:15pm. Amazing views and it was almost empty!! $8 each total. On the way back we got off at battery park city walked to Occulus to catch that subway home. Almost 18k steps.    Day 3 - Tuesday  Left hotel at 9:10 to go to our Free Tours by Foot thrifting tour near Eataly- subway was down due to water main break. Tried taking a free shuttle bus but it was packed and going way too slow. So we grabbed an Uber at 72nd st ($$$) took about 20 min. Saw the Flat Iron but it‚Äôs covered in scaffolding. Grabbed a coffee at Eataly‚Äôs cafe vergano. Barista Nikole was pretty sour faced. Met up with our Vintage shopping tour at 10:50. First stop: Crossroads on 26th st. Walked through Madison square park. Walked to Gramercy. Your wnded around 12:40pm. It was just an ok tour - nothing mind blowing. Lunch at Wendy‚Äôs bc it was quick & easy. Walked to Blick‚Äôs Art Supplies bc my daughter is an artist then we checked out the Container store then subway home. Ordered in Taqueria 86 through DoorDash and stayed in for the night to recoup. 11k steps    Day 4- Wed  Rainy morning. Took the Subway to Brooklyn Museum to see the Pablo-matic art exhibit. Stayed about an hour it was ok. Recommend downloading the app for the audio. Juliana‚Äôs pizza for lunch. Had a pepperoni and sausage and it was amazing! Absolutely lived up to the hype. Walked to Jane‚Äôs carousel Time Out market for ice cream at Sugar Hill Creamery (cookies & caramel was to die for). Spectacular views from the rooftop. Walked to front street & Washington for photo op. Heads up: it‚Äôs super busy and there is a lot of Instagramming posing happening. People don‚Äôt just take the pic and move on. They will stand there and strike a pose FOREVER. Walked the Brooklyn Bridge and it was the best!!! Note: it really is the cheapest place to get little souvenirs. Kiddo loved the stands. Walked to city hall park which is super pretty - subway to Richard rodgers th√©√¢tre to try and score rush tix to Hamilton. Nope lol. Walked across the street and got tix to Sweeney Todd with Josh Groban. Subway to hotel to relax for a bit. I got some wine during a complimentary happy hour in the hotel. Out again at 7:15 to see the show. JG was obviously really good but Dustin from Stranger Things is also in it and he was fantastic! So was the actress who plays Mrs Lovett. My daughter absolutely loved it!! I enjoyed it but be forewarned: the seats are TIGHT. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4‚Äù and my knees were pressed up on the seat in front of me couldn‚Äôt even cross my ankles!! 17500 steps      DAY 5- Thursday  left around 1020 to go to The Met (subway & bus). 100% recommend going to the rooftop terrace- the views are so so good! Saw the Van Gogh and Monet exhibits which were an unexpected surprise. Grabbed a hot dog and chicken stick out front for a quick lunch. Took the bus down 5th- Stopped along the way to Barnes and noble bookstore. Took 7 subway to Hudson yards/vessel. Had lunch at the shops of HY. Walked the high line to Chelsea. Took the 3 train to 72nd street. Hit Trader joe‚Äôs- I wanted to stock up on Umami seasoning since we can‚Äôt get it in Canada. The lineups are always bananas!!! There‚Äôs traffic control for the lineups ugh!! Never seen this in other cities. Anyhoo Back to hotel to relax before going to Summit for 7pm entry. We were there an hour and a half‚Ä¶ the views were super as we were there for sunset. My daughter‚Äôs sensory issues affected her ability to really enjoy it. She loved the views but the crowds were a bit much for her. Subway back up to UWS. Grabbed a banana pudding at Magnolia Bakery (Yum!) and back to hotel for some rest. 19500 steps    Day 6- Friday : Last day!  Out the door around 8:40am to Zucker‚Äôs bagels for breakfast. I got a hot pastrami on everything bagel & kiddo got an everything bagel with cream cheese - both were delicious! Grabbed half a dozen bagels to bring home for the hubby. Walked to Columbus circle hit up the target and just checked everything out. Walked back uptown through the park and then on Central Park West. I then went on my own to rent a citi bike (hot tip: get a 15 day free trial and it will cost you nothing to ride around). Rode the Hudson River greenway path to Pier 79 and back. So much fun!!$ highly recommend it. Showered up and we checked out of the hotel. Took the subway & M60 bus to LGA. Got here super early security took no time. Chilled out at the air canada lounge until it was time to board.    We had an amazing time!! NYC is my favourite city and I loved sharing it with my daughter. Cheers!! ,jocelyner986,New York City,"Winnipeg, Canada"
I read that they have closed the Rose Reading Room for tourists but only open for the readers with books and laptops. But how is this policy enforced? We are a family with two teenagers so we are planning to spend half a day in the library reading and navigating but obviously we are not serious readers but just casual visitors trying to find some leisure time with books. We may read some novels or so but no plan to bring our own books or laptops. We could bring a kindle though.    In this situation will we be allowed to enter Rose Reading Room for reading like an hour? Just for clarification we have no intention to visit the room and take pictures and leave in 5 seconds. ,whitebug,New York City,whitebug

I know. Tourist passes.    I‚Äôve checked the forums using the search function and the general replies are it depends on what you want to see and do. So. To give you a bit more info.    Me and DW have been before and loved it so are planning on taking our two adult lads (22 and 25) with us next September to celebrate us finally finishing our mortgage. Four days five nights.    So. We‚Äôre looking at doing the following things.    ESB  HOHO bus tour  9/11 museum  OWO (or some kind of high level observation deck). We did this one last time and loved the cheesy American ‚Äúreveal‚Äù at the top although it was completely clouded over.  Museum of Natural History (although I believe this is a ‚Äúdonation‚Äù entry fee??)  Evening boat trip along Manhattan (can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name)    Maybe Edge?    We‚Äôll do the freebies as well (Brooklyn high line etc)    From what I can see it‚Äôs either the sightseeing pass or the New York pass.    Was hoping you experts could advise which one might suit us and the best place to buy.    Any help would be appreciated.    Thanks. ,Ladleboy,New York City,Newton Abbot...

My husband and I are traveling to NYC from 9/15-24 to visit our children who work and go to school there. We are planning on working remotely the week of 9/18 and are looking for a hotel room or suite that would have either chairs and desk/ table space to set up 2 laptops - or have 1 desk in the room and a reliable spot to work somewhere in the hotel (like a business center). We would prefer to be between Wall Street and Washington Square Park-ish area or in Brooklyn to be located close to where they live/ work and go to school. I would love suggestions! It seems like these types of rooms are in the $600 range but we are willing to entertain higher (ouch) if needed because it is important that we have a place to work. Another option is a work place (like WeWork) but those seem to require a monthly commitment. Thank you for your suggestions! ,Julie J,New York City,San Francisco...

Hello all    My son is an asperger syndrome adult quite independent and 25 years old. He wants to go in vacation to New York for about a week in September. Although he's living independently he can be disorganised and in his own world. My wife and I are concerned about him being alone in a big city and managing to keep safe and well.    Is there an organisation of some sort or an authenticated guide that could support him while he's there? We're thinking someone to meet him at the airport maybe organise some trips to check in on him once or twice a day and be available on the phone if he needs help?

My husband and will be flying into Newark airport at about 9pm from London. We fly out late the next afternoon from JFK airport. We don't mind getting an Uber/taxi as we will have luggage unless this is a bad idea. This is the end leg of a month-long trip.

We just got back from a seven day trip to NYC and had a blast even if we still didn't get everything done we wanted. So here are my three must do activities for any NYC visit:    The Summit Observatory at One Vanderbilt - https://summitov.com/experience/  I've been to many observation decks and this is by far the best. We spent 2 1/2 hours there and it was amazing. The three different experiences as you make your way to the top are incredible and not to be missed. Make sure to visit at night where there are less crowds and the lights of the city are all on display.    9/11 Memorial/Museum - https://www.911memorial.org/  This was even more immersive than I anticipated. We spent almost 3 hours here and could have spent more time but it's such an emotional experience. We were completely drained by the time we left but it was so worth it. Monday evenings are free but check the website for more information.    Sleep No More - https://mckittrickhotel.com/events/sleep-no-more/  Yes there are some great Broadway shows (and we saw are fill of amazing theater) but the one highlight is the Sleep No More experience. This award winning theatrical experience tells Shakespeare‚Äôs Scottish tragedy through a dark film noir cinematic lens and takes place in a warehouse converted to the six floor McKittrick Hotel. Guests decide where to go and what to see. You can choose to follow one character or 15 different characters throughout the evening. Because this experience does include some nudity and violence children are not allowed to check-in. My husband and I both went and half the fun is connecting at the end to discuss what each of us saw. We both had many different experiences and we will definitely return on our next New York trip. ,Craigsjourney,New York City,"Seattle, Washington"

NYC Local Law 18 in effect starting Tuesday includes:    1. A maximum of 2 paying guests can stay in a short-term rental at a time (regardless of dwelling size or bedroom numbers).    2. Hosts must be physically present while property is rented.    3. All inside doors must remain unlocked so all occupants can access entire unit.    Questions:    1. Who benefits?    2. Will NYC (including restaurants entertainment and taxis/Lyft/Uber) lose cost-conscious visitors?    3. How much extra would this cost you?    4. Would you prefer another destination with a perspective you feel is more hospitable and cost-conscious? How will you respond? ,LittleBiffOne,New York City,"Rockville, Maryland"

Hi    We will be arriving via Amtrak late morning on a Thursday with probably 3 suitcases plus backpacks. Our hotel is Hotel Beacon. Pretty set on not using the subway just due to the luggage but is a taxi or a car service better?    Also didn't really want to blow up another tipping discussion so hiding this in here; we will be getting a couple of (small padded envelope type size if that makes a difference) packages delivered to the hotel (they have confirmed this is fine). What would be the appropriate tip when we pick these up please?    Thanks in advance. ,Clare C,New York City,
Hello.    We have never been to NYC before and are traveling in December. We have the following on our bucket list: Rockefeller Center Times Square see the decor in the window of the dept stores along 5th Street see Central Park go to Summit One Vanderbilt and see the Statue of Liberty. I have narrowed my search down to two hotels. Hilton Garden Inn Times Square North or The Grayson. Which do you recommend and why? Would like to be close to some restaurants and hopefully walking distance to most of the attractions listed. Thank you always Deb ,Deborah M,New York City,"Detroit, Michigan"
I'm bringing my daughter for a bucket list Xmas nyc trip and our hotel is the Fairfield Inn in the financial district as don't have the budget for anywhere in midtown. Anyway on our itinerary is a dyker heights tour to see the Christmas lights. It seems a bit silly joining a tour that all seem to set off from the times square area to go back on ourselves to reach dyker heights. Just wondering how easy this would be to do independently and what the best way to get there would be. Looking on Google maps it seems a taxi would probably be easiest transport does anyone know roughly how much this would cost? Or if there's a better way or even if its best just to join a bus tour?  Many thanks for any advice ,CurtisTravels,New York City,
We are staying at the courtyard by Times Square. On Friday September 29 in the afternoon we are going to go to Ground Zero because I haven‚Äôt seen it since January 2002.    After that we would like to get soup dumplings/Asian food somewhere. I have looked at Phillipe chow which is up by Central Park. I have also looked at Chinese tuxedo although they don‚Äôt have soup dumplings. Being that it‚Äôs going to be a Friday night I am not really wanting to wait an hour plus for dinner and I really enjoy a cocktail with my meal so I‚Äôm not sure there is a recommendation in Chinatown per se. I would love some feedback/personal experience. I‚Äôm not really looking to spend a fortune which is why I‚Äôm not super excited about Philippe chow. We are going to Carbone on Saturday night so looking for more of an experience without breaking the wallet. ,Christine S,New York City,"Ballwin, Missouri"
Hi there    We are coming to NYC for a few days then travelling down the east coast to Philadelphia then Baltimore then Washington and then back again using Amtrak.    The Amtrak website states that luggage has to be a max of 50 lbs. and 28 x 22 x 14 inches each. The weight will not be a problem but measuring our cases they are just over 28 inches inc wheels but 28 inches not including the wheels. Is that likely to be a problem and do we have to buy smaller luggage which will be a pain.    In the UK this is not enforced at all and as long as you can carry it on then it s ok. So thought I would ask first.    Any help always appreciated.    Martin ,Martin M,New York City,"Bridgend, United..."

We are coming to New York the first week of December. My husband and I (age 60's) came in 2019 and loved the Christmas trees Bryant park Central Park Rockefeller center. This time we are bringing our daughter grandson (age10) and granddaughter (age 7) with us. We liked staying in time square when we came before and we were near the subway near Bryant park and walked to Rockefeller center to the tree etc.    Can you suggest some hotels to stay at? For the 5 of us????? Wanting a safe area and not too far from the subway    We have been looking at Hampton Inn Time Square Center ---41st ave (so far our favorite location wise)    Also Doubletree by Hilton Time Square South -----8th Ave at 37th Ave    Need any suggestions ? ,bridgetj414,,"Nashville, Tennessee"

Hello    My husband and I are bringing our 16-year-old daughter to NYC from December 28-31. She loved NYC the last time we visited (2019) and her brothers will be on another school trip while we are in NYC so this trip will be just for her.    We have our flights booked (arriving around noon on the 28th) but need to decide where to stay. We have a diverse list of things we plan to do and so I'm not sure what the best location would be for our lodging. Our budget is malleable and I haven't even started searching yet but I was hoping for a range of $350 to $450 if that's possible this time of year.    Things we plan to do:  1) Walk the Columbia University Campus (no private tours due to the holidays)  2) Walk the NYU Campus (I have a good friend who lives in/near Union Square and she was a resident at NYU so she may walk the undergrad campus area with us and we may eat dinner/lunch with her if she is in town) - again no guided tours due to the holidays  3) See Hadestown  4) See the Nutcracker Ballet (my daughter has been in classical ballet since age 4 and has performed in the Twin Cities Ballet Nutcracker since age 6 so this is important to us)  5) Enjoy Christmas in NYC - foods sights etc. I've seen a lot of suggestions on the forum for these things so will show them to my daughter to get her final list. Obviously we have limited time so we know we will have to keep this list short and geographically contained.    We are from Minnesota so we know that longs walk in the cold will not be pleasant but we have plenty of warm outerwear to don for whatever weather NYC is experiencing while we are there.    Any suggested hotel locations to look at based on the above? ,JKEWJ,New York City,Saint Paul...

Hello. I'm going down to the US in a few weeks and will have a few hours to spend in New York City before I have to pick up my girlfriend at Laguardia Airport.    I've decided to rent a bicycle for a few hours and ride around Central Park. I've chosen Bike Rental Central Park at 1391 6th Avenue between West 56th and West 57th Streets. They are conveniently located a few blocks south of the southern end of the park and have gotten good reviews.    My questions are: As I'll be driving up from New Jersey and have limited time I feel that I need to park my car near the rental place. Never having driven in NYC it seems very intimidating as to how to pick a place to park. Street parking has been cited as being complex even for the locals so I want to go with a garage.    Everything in the area seems to be Valet Parking and nothing is really getting good reviews lol.  The closest seem to be SB+ New York Parking 56th Str. Corporation and IM Park. Any recos as to a good lot nearby?    Second question is parking at Laguardia. Terminal B is my destination. It seems as if there is terminal parking but they advise that during 'busy hours' it might be best to actually reserve a spot. Even though the web site has never had the lot listed as more than half full is this advisable for a Friday afternoon? Also is it well sign posted driving around and near the airport?    Finally what will driving in New York City between 2 and 4 PM be like? Crazy? Very crazy??    Thanks so much in advance for any and all help. ,NEIL F,,"Toronto, Canada"

We are arriving at Manhattan Cruise terminal departing next morning (10;30 am) from EWR. Things we would like to do are the cruise tour to Statue of Libery a hop on-hop off and maybe take in a ball game at Yankee stadium. Staying downtown is not an option because of the cost of the rooms. Was thinking of staying near airport with a shuttle to make it easier in the morning until the idea of a ball game came up.Now we are thinking we should stay some place closer to there or on the outskirts of downtown. We need to store luggage so if we can pop over the hotel and store before check in that works too. We are trying to also avoid spending a fortune on taxi fare. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Never been to NY before and my husband is not a city person. The ball game is a bribe to help him cope! ,sirdiesel,New York City,"Canmore, Canada"

After spending 5 days in NYC we will rent a car and spend about another week driving around the East Coast eventually flying back from Boston and returning the car to the airport there. I've roughly priced it out and it is not a huge money saver to pick up the car in Boston versus anywhere else so I don't want to do the Amtrak all the way to Boston because there's things we want to stop and see on the way.    I have driven around most major cities on the West Coast but never on the East Coast so I'd like to bypass driving in Manhattan as much as possible as I think it's a little out of my league since now I live in Alaska and traffic doesn't even exist here haha. I'm wondering if there's a good location outside the city where the roads calm down a bit but is still accessible by public transportation so we can get there easily on checkout day? And then ideally there are rental cars near where we would get off the public transportation.    I just randomly checked Stamford CT and it looks doable but open to other suggestions that are closer to Manhattan. I could also post this in the New England forum if that would be more appropriate.    Thank you so much! ,Katie,New York City,Alaska

Hi there  I‚Äôm taking my sister to New York for her 50 th birthday and would really appreciate some input from folks with local knowledge  My sister has multiple sclerosis and although can transfer from her wheelchair she cannot walk any distance. She loves city breaks and we will see some of the main sights but it‚Äôs all dependant on her energy levels. She loves staying in a quieter area ( a good selection of cafes restaurants etc within a few streets ) it‚Äôs not the noise of a city that‚Äôs the problem more pavements jammed with people . When visiting the main sight s I know it will be crowded but after any sightseeing it lovely to come back to a more chilled pace.

Hello friends!  I'm planning a trip to visit colleges in NYC and elsewhere in New York in the week and a half prior to Thanksgiving. The NYC portion of the trip is already planned and is actually much easier than planning the logistics for the other portion. My plan was to fly into and out of NYC (from the Los Angeles area) arriving late in the evening of Wednesday November 15. We have all day Thursday and Friday to visit at least two if not all three schools of Vassar College (the must) Bard College and Sarah Lawrence College. I'd like to be back in NYC on Saturday morning.    I have not yet booked our flights but right now I'm looking at arriving at JFK around 11om-midnight. I'd imagine we would stay close by the airport or train station.    Please help me figure out the best plan for the logistics of this. It will be my daughter and myself for that portion of the trip (the rest of the family will be joining us in NYC on Saturday afternoon). Is this reasonable to do by train with Ubering a reasonable plan from train station to hotel/universities/eating? Or is it going to be more feasible to rent a car to hit all our stops in a timely manner? Or some combination? I'd also love recommendations on where to stay. Given that we will be having plenty of time in NYC the next week staying somewhere lovely that isn't the city seems delightful.    For campus visits we have options of 10:00 am or 2:00 pm at Bard on the 16th or 17th 9:30 am and 2:30 pm on the 16th or 17th at Vassar and 10 am or 2 pm at Sarah Lawrence on the 16th or 17th with the additional possibility of an 11 am visit on the 18th. I'd tentatively imagined doing Bard at 2pm on the 16th spending the night somewhere near Vassar doing Vassar at 9:30 am on the 17th. Is it unrealistic to imagine making it for the 2pm visit at Sarah Lawrence on the 17th? ,Elizabeth C,,Los Angeles...

I would love to plan a trip for me and my 6 year old he read about Niagara Falls over a year ago and really wants to visit.    If Labor Day is a no go we will put it on hold but I'd still love any advice/recommendations you may have for activities food hotels etc. (US side only please) ,Jen,Niagara Falls,

My family will be traveling to NYC Sept 2-4 arriving by train at Moynihan around 1pm. We will be 5 - 2 adults 2 kids (5 and 8) and a grandma who can‚Äôt walk long distances. Hoping to get some help with our itinerary.    1. We are staying at Hyatt Place New York City/Times Square which appears to be a 10 min walk or 7 min drive from Moynihan.  Should we try to walk to our hotel with our luggage? Grandma is fine with it but I am concerned about keeping hold on my children while carting luggage.    2. Planning to check in or drop luggage with a bell check until our room is ready and head back out. Thinking Times Square Bryant Park library and either Rockefeller or Empire State Building - and would get tickets to the observation deck for one of them‚Ä¶ planning to book tickets the day before so we can check weather. This is advice I have found on here but can you confirm I don‚Äôt need to book tickets sooner? Also which one should we do and is it worth targeting the more expensive sunset tickets? (Possibly roller skate at Rockefeller). We also considered Edge for our observation deck won‚Äôt do Summit One since grandma thinks it will make her sick.    3. Back to hotel to finish check in if necessary then dinner. Interested in Ellen‚Äôs Stardust Diner (we aren‚Äôt planning to see any shows and I think the kids would love this) but if line too long or we are later than we intend any recommendations nearby?    4. Planning breakfast at hotel and then take the subway to Central Park. Most of what we want to see is in the south half of the park and hoping grandma can handle it but if not she will just sit somewhere and wait for us. Also considering booking pedicab tour in advance. I know people here say to avoid these but since we won‚Äôt be able to walk the whole park it could be a better fit for our family than others? Any recommendations on who to book? I have found options for $200-300 for the group for an hour. Also- Advice about the subway or anything else?    5. We will have lunch somewhere (park? Pier?) then head to pier 83 for a Circle Line boat ride - thinking the 1.5 hour Landmarks tour at 2pm or 3pm do I need to buy tickets in advance? Any smaller boat tours recommended over this? I think we should take a cab/Uber (8 min) but let me know if there is a better option.    6. Back to hotel to rest and then out to dinner - maybe try StarDust diner if we didn‚Äôt do the night before? It makes me nervous not having dinner reservations though‚Ä¶. If weather is bad Saturday we would fit the observation deck thing in this afternoon/night instead.    7. Monday our flight is not until 3:50 at LGA planning to leave around 1pm and take a cab/Uber. Thinking we might be able to fit in the Harry Potter store for my daughter and maybe take subway to Brooklyn Bridge Park and walk back across bridge (would likely leave grandma behind for this).    Feeling a little overwhelmed by all my research and notes! Other things I feel like we are missing out on: AMNH (we have been the Field Museum twice recently wandering neighborhoods and exploring local playgrounds/parks‚Ä¶ Roosevelt Island tram Fearless girl Washington Square Park Castle Clinton splash pad pier one sunset rainbow bagels Time Out Market‚Ä¶. We are from Chicago so although Kids would like the Colour factory slomoo ice cream museum we can do those at home I think.    Thanks in advance for all your help! ,tinsel1,New York City,"Chicago, Illinois"

Hi we are looking to book accommodation in NYC for 2 nights before cruising back to the UK. We will be staying with friends in Lake Canandaigua for 5 nights and then going to New York arriving Wednesday mid afternoon and leaving the hotel about 11am on Friday to head over to board Queen Mary.    This will be a flying visit to New York and only plan soaking in the atmosphere cycling in Central Park perhaps walking the High Line and visiting the 911 Memorial.    We are flying to the US with Virgin Atlantic and they have some decent hotel prices when booking through them. We have previously stayed at the Casablanca hotel but they no longer offer their managers wine hour so looking at other options which are similarly priced. A few I am considering included the Marriott Marquis Kimpton Hotel Eventi Rui Plaza The Sanctuary the Embassy Suites.    We are happy to walk a fair distance as will be at sea for the following 7 days so glad of the exercise.    Any feedback thoughts are welcome. Many thanks ,Pindy4,New York City,Newburgh England
Hello    I have situation and need feedback/help I have single name which is common in few Asian countries like Pakistan etc. but now I am worried how to book airline ticket what might can happen during my immigration and verification process in US etc. All sort of weird thoughts.    My passport has give name: AAMIR and surname is empty  My US Visa has Given name: FNU and surname: AAMIR (US visa officer said that this is standard)    However each airline has their own naming policy in such a situation. Now I have a fear that my passport vs Visa vs airline ticket will have different name combination.    Is there any one who has an idea how to handle such a situation did anyone here faced it? ,Aamir I,,

Hello  Ive been reading lots of posts as I put together a plan for a family break in October.  we are 2 adults and our 12 year old son my husband and I have visited NY 6 times but a long time ago! (2002-2006ü§£).  as this is our sons first trip we are going to do some traditional touristy things!  The plan is  Sunday - still to be decided we arrive late on Saturday night (flight lands at 21:00) so this day will depend on how we are! but probably Empire State Building and 9/11 memorial.    Monday Woodbury common    Tuesday open top bus tour and night tour -staying on the bus for the whole cicuit not getting off at differnet places - our son loves open top tours so this is his yes day!    Wednesday Central Park bikes posh shops broadway show. Planning on a morning or more in CP son and husband want to cycle the whole way round - is this possible? (I may cycle or run it not sure yet!) we will follow this by a visit to posh shops. Planning a show that evening but will depend what last minute tickets we can get we don't mind if we see something or don't!    Thursday Statue of Liberty Elis island again requests from our son. He wants to climb to the top of SOL/crown - i'm not so keen - we may also drop Elis Island and save for another time - he loves history but i'm not too sure how much he will get out of this visit. also I think if we go to the crown of SOL that takes a lot of time and theres lots we want to do!        Friday last day - fly out of JFK at 11pm so we have all day  The other things we want to do are:    High line Chelsea market piers friends set 9/11 memorial  Empire state building Roosevelt island (tram ride). Intrepid sea and space museum (although concord is not on display at the moment). walk over Brooklyn Bridge  Ive also read about the One World Tower so that may get added in.    we don't like to over plan just in case we are loving something or maybe not enjoying it and want to move on!    My husband is a 30 year Fire Fighter just retired and wants to spend time at the memorial and I believe there is a fire fighter museum.  Son wants to experience NY and I want some shops so I think i've covered a little bit for everyone! what do you think? is it too much or could I plan the days a little better? thanks?    restaurants  Lum Lum ( read about it in someones trip report!)  Westaway dinner (breakfast) ( we ate there for most breakfasts on most days on our previous visits as we saw the NYPD having breakfast so I think our boy will find it quite authentic unless you guys have a better recommendation!)  Fish restaurant in Grand Central -Station basement - we ate here before and have amazing memories - is it still great?  Trailer park lounge  Son also want to buy a slice of huge pizza as seen in a film / you tuber? any suggestions please?    thanks for any advice you have !  Ps we are from Jersey in the Channel Islands but have never made it to New Jersey! ,Marina,New York City,"Jersey, United..."
I will be taking the train from CT to grand central and eventually to JFK. My question is if I purchase a round trip Metro North eticket will I have problems when I return to CT. The website says don‚Äôt change the time on your phone as this makes your ticket invalid. However I am flying out of the country so my time will change on my phone. Do they mean once you validate the ticket don‚Äôt change the time on your phone? ,WOZ,New York City,New England
We will be in NY next weekend and look forward to having a couple of really good meals. We're staying near MOMA and it would be ideal if we could find restaurants that we could walk to from our hotel.

What are your favorites near MOMA? Thank you!! ,YogaMamaD,New York City,Cincinnati

Hi  I am travelling to Niagara Falls via Maple Leaf from New York Amtrak Moynihan train station tomorrow.  I will be staying at Tower Hotel at Fallsview.  Please help how to get to the hotel from the train station. Google maps giving me the bus option. This is my first time in Canada and I don't know how the bus works do I need to buy bus ticket before boarding the bus or can I pay the bus driver? How much the bus fare? Is taxi very expensive? Is there another option? Appreciate the help.  Thanks in advance. ,Chris,Niagara Falls,

Hi we are visiting 21st October - 27th October 2 adults and a 12year old.    I've researched hotels and back in 2006 we stayed in a Hilton Garden Inn I'm trying to book it but can not work out which one it is!  I think it was close to Central Park but my husband says it was 10 blocks away and closer to Times Square!! what I do remember there was a subway/metro station at the corner and this took us direct to Grand Central Station it was walking distance to Westaway Diner - any locals know where I might mean - sorry its so vague!    So we were going to book at one or other of the Garden Inn's either Central Park South or Times Square central  or  Le Meridien I like the location there.  But then ......... Ive been reading too many trip reports on here ......... I like the sound of the Michelangelo The Muse and so many others!    Whats the difference please between a queen bed and a double bed (which is bigger please?)    What does the resort fee mean? Is it another tax or is it the tip? Thanks    Lastly we arrive into JFK at 21:00 in the past we've landed at Newark and used the train in to the city so easy! I've looked at the train from JFK and really can't understand it!! I've even watched a youtuber doing the journey - starting to think my independent travel days are behind me ü§£  although I imagine landing at 9pm by the time we clear immigration and the baggage hall it will be about 10 or later so maybe better to just get taxi from the dispatcher unless someone can talk me through the air train (I do not want to be defeated by this!).    Thanks everyone ,Marina,New York City,"Jersey, United..."

Before my recent stay at TownePlace Suites Times Square I received the confirmation email showing the breakdown of all the charges by the day. However my credit card was charged over the total by nearly $200. I was told at checkout not to worry and that they will refund the difference within a few days. After nearly 3 weeks nothing was heard. I sent several emails inquiring about it but they were all ignored. Then I read in the BBC website that President Biden himself has personally condemned this practice of overcharging and wanted to introduced a Junk Fees Prevention Act. Now I realize that this hotel which is part of the Marriot chain has overcharged and has no intention to refund the difference.  It does not matter whether the overcharged sum is big or small relative to the overall total. There is a legal contract with the total payable clearly stated. The hotel simply and blatantly overcharged without even any excuse or reason. It seems that they hope to get away with it by ignoring and exhausting you. Has american business morals deteriorated to such an extent just for MONEY? Will this practice spread to all other purchases in future? Say you buy a TV and then the store just arbitrarily overcharge you? Is this acceptable? ,OasidubfO,New York City,
We went to NF many years ago after dropping our daughter off at UB for her freshman year. Now we are thinking of a family reunion vacation probably 5-6 nights in the summer of 2024. Half the family is coming from Long Island and the other half from the northern Detroit suburbs. It‚Äôs been suggested that the falls area would be good. The family would consist of 4 adults (grandparent ages) 4 adults (the parents) and 5 grandchildren who would be 6 5 3.5 2 and 9 months.  Here‚Äôs my questions all suggestions are welcome and thanks in advance for answering:  1- Hotel suggestions: we will need suites or cottages with multiple bedrooms. Maybe a couple with fridges and microwaves. I‚Äôm thinking it might be as many as 4 suites or some combination with about 6 bedrooms. The initial suggestion was Great Wolf Lodge so the kids could go to the water park. But I saw in another thread that GW might have a lot of rides that the little ones can‚Äôt go on. Someone on that thread suggested Americana on the Canadian side. Passports are not a concern. Question: would you recommend GW Americana or somewhere else? Do these resorts have special offers? I‚Äôm thinking not for July or August.  2- I‚Äôm thinking one day for Maid of the Mist and Cave of the Winds. My recollection is that was really about a half day for just adults. We will have to build in time for lunches and naps for some of the crowd.  3- would you also recommend the Journey behind the Falls and the White Water Walk? I‚Äôll check the website to see if the walk would entail baby carrier or if it‚Äôs stroller friendly. Other NF related activities?  4- we would spend one day or maybe a half day at a water park. Which one do you think is best for ages 6 and under?  5- I saw that there is a Butterfly conservancy and Fort Niagara. I‚Äôll go to their websites but generally have you taken young children to these attractions?  6- what‚Äôs a good location for the fireworks and light show that won‚Äôt be too loud for the kids?  7- Do you think I‚Äôve allowed enough time too much?  8- is the outlet mall still great?  9- something fun for the parents while the grandparents babysit evening or otherwise?  The LI contingency has a place to stop just a little short of halfway ( north of Binghamton). We‚Äôve all done the drive many times so really just looking for suggestions around Niagara Falls to make it a fun stay for everyone. Please offer any ideas and suggestions or criticisms. ,Marty S,Niagara Falls,"Oceanside, New York"

Hello  We have a rough idea of what we would like to see in the short time we have. Would appreciate advice on selecting the dates and times for pre-booking the attractions. Want to make sure we don't set unrealistic times etc.  Also kids are 8 and 11 so we need to keep it interesting for them too.    Landing in LGA Fri 8/25 730am taking bus to the subway to/from the city.  Return flight Sun 8/27 LGA 9pm    Hotel is 35th street near Times Square.    ? 1)  Straight to hotel to drop off luggage vs go straight to attraction and utilize luggage storage options?    Should be a backpack each and maybe 1-2 rolling carry on.  Luggage storage could get pricey on a per bag basis?      ? 2)  Things we would like to see this trip:    Summit One - booked Fri 7pm  Things around the Times Square area:  The Vessel  St. Pat's  High Line      American Museum of Natural History  Central Park  (suggestions for what/where in the park would be great)      9/11 Memorial & Museum  Ferry Access to Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island  (Pedistal tickets likely wont stay long at Ellis may skip)  Brooklyn Bridge - walk out onto it  One World observatory  Chinatown ,outatouch0,New York City,North Carolina
Hi! I'm an early planner and have been researching hotels for next summer. I'm familiar with N.Y. so my question doesn't involve location. Both of these hotels have that classical European style which I absolutely adore. As far as beauty and luxury is concerned does one hotel have an advantage over the other? I've already checked out room options and prices and at the Michelangelo there's a special deal whereby we would get a junior suite and be entitled to a full breakfast. (According to the deal the suites are discounted and the junior suite is even cheaper than a regular room!) At the Elysee we would choose a regular room and there they give you a complimentary continental breakfast. Obviously the room itself at the Michelangelo is much bigger but the Elysee option still seems very nice and it's much cheaper so I want to consider that hotel as well. At this point my question has nothing to do with the price. All I want to know is if one of the hotels is considered to be nicer than the other.  Thanks in advance. ,Shoesy,New York City,Israel

My family of 4 with a small dog are going to drive to NYC from Canada by car. At first we want to stay in Manhattan near Times Square for convenience and vibe. However we can't seem to find any hotel/garage parking with in/out privilege in Manhattan or nearby areas (except for hotels in NJ Long Island/Queens and airport area). Since we have a small dog my husband and I will take turn to visit the attractions with our children therefore we want to be able to drive around for pickup/drop-off not to lock our car in the garage the whole time. Where should we stay so we can have in/out privilege parking (free parking is even better)? We were thinking of Long IIsland/Queens area or NJ but not sure how the traffic would look like for going to Manhattan/Times Square in the morning dropping off. Which areas/hotels would be best for us with a pet? We will stay for 4 days and want to see at least 1 show and the main attractions like Empire State Building Top of the Rock MET Liberty Statue 9/11 memorial site Vanderbilt Edge Times Square Central Park and American Dream mall (NJ). We may buy the Attraction Pass (is the 2- or 3-day Go Pass better than the 5-attraction City Pass?) and unlimited Metro Pass (if required). After NYC we will drive to Washington and Virginia. Any advice would be much appreciated. ,Melissa Lee,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"

Hi again  I have finally picked a hotel in Manhattan for next June. We're arriving via Amtrak on Sunday May 26th into Moynihan Train Hall. Since it's a Sunday we won't arrive into NYC until 6:00pm so we won't have a ton of time when we arrive. We'll be starving and will get dinner and walk some. We're staying at the Home2 Suites by Hilton at 150 W 48th St. A lot of things we can walk to from our hotel as they are less than 2 miles away and we'll take rideshare/subway/taxi where we need to. We are in New York until Sunday June 2nd when we get on our cruise from the Manhattan Cruise Terminal. It will be my wife and myself and our 12 year old. Walking isn't an issue for any of us as we walk several miles each day.    Here's the itinerary that I have come up with for our trip and put the time I allowed at each place in parenthesis in hours. We have never been to NYC but are well traveled. What I did was create a Google Map and pin everything we wanted to see/do and tried to group things together the best that I could for efficiency.    Please let me know any adjustments I should make. Thanks!    Sunday (Arrival):  M&Ms World (2hr)  Fox News (1hr) (Just taking pictures)  Hershey's Chocolate World (1hr)    Monday:  Ellen's Stardust Diner (2hr)  Time's Square (3hr) (wondering around taking pictures)  Radio City Music Hall (1hr)  Rockefeller Center (2hr)  St. Patrick's Cathedral (1hr)    Tuesday:  Macy's (1hr)  Bryant Park (2hr)  SUMMIT One (2hr)  Grand Central (1hr) (Just getting pictures)  Central Park (3hr) (Pedicab ride sight-see)  Hudson Yards (1hr)    Wednesday:  United Nations Tour (1hr)  National Museum of Mathematics (3hr)  Empire State Building (2hr)  The Friends Experience (1hr)  Museum of Ice Cream (2hr)    Thursday:  Little Italy (1hr) (Explore & pictures)  Chinatown (1h) (Explore & pictures)  One World Observatory (1hr)  9/11 Memorial & Museum (3hr)  Staten Island Ferry (1hr) (Just riding it to say we did)  Brooklyn Bridge (1hr) (Walking across it picture taking)    Friday:  Statue of Liberty (5hr)  Broadway Play (5hr)  Big Bus Tour (2hr)    Saturday:  Free day so we can circle back and see anything that we missed or didn't have time to get to.    Sunday:  Embark our cruise    ** I know I did not include food stops in my itinerary sans Ellen's Stardust Diner we will play that by ear and fit it in where we can. ,teknoge3k,New York City,Rocky Mount...

Because of concerns about us sharing a room w different genders/getting a hotel on our own/cost/school Monday/etc this is our plan for a Saturday in May. None of us have spent significant time in NYC before. We are all used to getting not enough sleep and will happily survive on coffee.    Carpool to and park at Union Station DC($25/3 = $8.30/person)  Take the 6:20AM train to NYC arriving at 9:45AM ($26/person for the day we were looking we would nap on the train)  10:00AM-7:30pm - Stuff (High Line The Met Times Square Central Park maybe Top of the Rock maybe Dominique Ansel Bakery maybe City Island etc).  8:00pm-10:30pm - A Broadway show we were thinking Hadestown because we've watched Wicked Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton in DC before; cost is a concern so any advice with getting student rush or discount tickets would be appreciated  11:05pm-2:39AM - Train back to Union($20/person) we'd nap on the train carpool home.    I was looking for advice on:    A) Does this seem safe (on the NYC side of things) for a group of 3 teens?  B) Tips for cheaper Broadway tickets for students considering we can't camp out at a ticket booth at 6 or 7AM?  C) Other advice/ideas? ,Random Person,New York City,"Reston, Virginia"
Looking at booking a 4 night trip in late October. Narrowed it down to these ones based on location price and favorable reviews. Anyone have any thoughts/opinions on these 3 options? I was looking at rates through a work discount site and all 3 end up being about the same price. Thinking we'll mainly take in some shows go to Central Park etc. If there's somewhere wonderful I've missed please chime in. Thanks in advance! ,AllesonWonderland,New York City,"Springdale, Arkansas"
good afternoon everyone it has been a long time when I was in Manhattan so it is good come back next year in April I am planning 2 days in between 2 cruises.  On hotwire I saw a great deal which would possibly be The Kitano. We stayed in this hotel about 10 or more years ago and at that time we liked it very much. ( big rooms and very quiet )  I have not booked it yet because I saw on the internet that The Kitano was rebranding to The Prince Kitano New York and would be refurbished this article was from last year so i wonder if this refurbishment already has started ? Anyone has an idea if construction work is going on at the Kitano it would be nice to get a refurbished room.  thank you all for your time. ,friedavdw,New York City,"Essen, Belgium"

I‚Äôm planning a future post-retirement two month road trip that includes driving through New York state. I wanted to get some opinions on the itinerary in regards to planned stops and length of stops:  Starting in Niagara Falls for just one night on to the Finger Lakes region staying in Ithaca for 3 nights. This would include hiking/waterfalls some wineries maybe golf.  1 night in Cooperstown for baseball HOF then on to Blue Mountain Lake for 3 nights.  Additionally after driving through VT NH Quebec City Nova Scotia Maine MA we would stop at FDR library and houses along with West Point for 2 nights and then on to 2 nights in the Hamptons stopping at Sagamore Hill on the way.  Thoughts? Remember this is part of of a 9 week trip. ,rmierenfeld,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
Hi All - I'm looking for any advice for somewhere to book for NYE (24) that's not entirely glitz and glam. It will be my 50th and it will just be myself and my husband - we are staying mid-manhattan. We are looking for somewhere with bookable seating inclusive food/drink that doesn't necessarily have us having to be dressed up to the nines. We'd prefer to stay away from places that will be more the scene of the young ones and instagrammers and not really into jazz blues opera. Any ideas would be appreciated - oh and not keen on the cruise idea either. TIA ,Susan S,New York City,
We are booked to come to New York for first time in Oct 2024    i know its over a year away but i was just wondering when do events for around that time go on sale - eg concerts basketball ice hockey  broadway shows etc    Is it best to pre book shows before we arrive or buy tickets when we get there    thanks    jo ,jojo71_40,New York City,West Bromwich...

Hello! Planning our trip for next summer and trying to decide on flights. We are traveling with our 3 teenagers coming from Alaska and flying Alaska Airlines. Not exactly sure where we'll be staying yet - one of the Hyatt options in Manhattan.    I'd prefer not to do a red-eye since then we'll be arriving completely exhausted before even beginning. However if we fly during the day we'll be arriving around 11pm/midnight NYC time.    Between JFK and EWR is there a better airport to fly into for a late-arriving flight? Tips for airport transport at that hour given that we'll be traveling with a family of 5?    Thanks! ,Katie,New York City,Alaska
Hey looking for a day trip to sag harbour without the shopping outlets. Can anyone recommend? ,Erica E,New York City,
IIn the past I have parked in Lot 9 at JFK. I have a 2 week trip coming up and I noticed a new long term parking option at a discounted rate. Its only $146 for 2 weeks. it states it is Official airport parking at a remote lot located 3 miles from the airport terminals. There is a Free shuttle bus which takes you to the Lefferts Blvd AirTrain Station with frequent connections to all terminals. Is anyone familiar with this option. It almost seems to good to be true. The location is 149th Ave and aqueduct rd ,STJ061205,New York City,"Pittsburgh, Pa"
This might be geared more to the locals I think 2 of the locals love Fire Island as much as I do    For those who dont know Fire Island is a barrier Island about 45 Miles east of NYC and can be reached via LIRR train and Bus to Robert Moses State Park  LIRR train to one of a bunch of ferries. On either end of Fire Island are Parks and in the middle are Commuties    Yesterday was a perfect beach day so I wanted to go to the beach Unfortunatly everyone else had the same idea. As I like Fire Island I drove there and when I got to the Robert Moses Causeway it was backed up they really need to increase the capacity of that bridge. I had wanted to do a video of walking from Robert Moses State park past the lighthouse and to the first 2 communities of Kismet and Saltaire Alas that was not meant to be They closed off Fields 4 and 5 (Field 5 is the closest to the lighthouse and the commuties and I had to go to Field 2 which is way on the west side of the Island.    Past Field 2 is an area that is only accessible 2 ways either with a Fishing Permit that allows you to drive on the Beach (Yes there are places in NY where you can drive on the beach) or walk    Since I dont have the permit I had to walk It was about a 30 Min walk from the gate to the Jetties at the west end of the Island and it was a walk over soft beach sand    I think in the fall and winter Seals hang out on these Jetties this part of Fire island is Called Democrat Point. This part of Fire Island doesnt even seem to have many photos on Google either    You can see from the Video there are plenty of vehicles there but its basically unknown to most and hard to get to    The video is a bit choppy as its actually kind of difficult to walk on Sand It was a bit difficult to walk this  If you think this is Crowded you should have seen the regular Fire Island Beach it was Wall to Wall people It looked like Coney Island on July 4th    Here is the video It is a bit choppy due to the walking on the sand. If you go to about 30:00 you can see the Jetties at the end of the Island (There is a little finger I did not go to) After the Jetties there was a section at the begining I missed before and thats what you see there.    There was some pipe construction barge at the begining that sort of ruined part of the scene    https://youtu.be/CPlGTd_plH0      While I have been many times to the lighthouse and the first few communities this was only the second time I have been to Democrat Point on the west end ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City

Now it's time to start asking the questions. My first full day in NYC will be Sunday October 1st. We are staying at M Social Times Square. So far my plans are to eat breakfast around hotel then head to High Line. Also go to Little Island. Once done with this will probably head back to hotel to rest then maybe do window shopping along 5th avenue area. I do plan to see a broadway show that evening. Does this sound reasonable for the day? I do not plan to jam pack my day but enjoy the city. I will have 4 full days and know I will not be able to see everything.

Hello    I am looking at booking the New York Hilton Midtown for a week around Christmas. 2 adults and a 7 year old.    They add on a daily $35 food and beverage credit for use in hotel restaurant bar and lounge. They also offer an option to add breakfast for approximately an extra $100 per night. I wouldn't do that - feel for $100 I can get a nicer option out and about or some bagels for a lot less!    Question - if anyone has stayed there how far does $35 go in their restaurant? I can't see it even covering one meal! Would you save them up for one meal there / drinks?    Or look at another hotel that doesn't charge this?    I haven't seen this option before so not sure how it works.    Thanks in advance :) ,Gillian P,New York City,"Perth, Australia"

We'll be visiting New York from 30th Nov to 4th December with our two youngest boys - 17 and 14. Coming from the UK and staying near Times Square. Whilst the wife and I have been before and covered a lot of the tourist things the boys aren't currently too fussed about doing those (although I have no doubt they'll have a bit of a change of mind as the time approaches - my youngest is already now talking about wanting to explore Central Park). They are interested in the Rockerfeller tree and rink a bit of Macy's shopping and we're going to see a Nets game but getting much else out of them is hard work! I'd really appreciate some advice on    1. Best way to travel from JFK - metro or cab?  2. Best value metro ticket to purchase  3. Good places to eat lunch and dinner (not crazy expensive)  4. Any store sales advice for around the time we'll be there.  5. Any ideas for new and/or quirky activities    Thanks in advance ,adam d,New York City,Hoo Saint Werburgh...

(Also posted this on NY forum before I realized there was a specific NYC forum).    Hello! We were going to be traveling the Friday before Labor Day and planned to pass through Flushing Queens on our way in to NYC. This unfortunately would take us right through the US Open area. Matches start at 11am and 7pm. If we drive through around noon or 1pm when matches have already started is the traffic still horrendous or is there generally a lull once the matches are in progress?    And if we wanted to park around the Queens Zoo or Queens Museum for about an hour are parking charges exorbitant because of the Open?    I know there are other routes into NYC but we would prefer head through Flushing unless the traffic/costs are too brutal...    Thanks ,lmunroek,New York City,Cambridge...
Made a quick stop at Niagara Falls on the way to Cape Cod!    Family of 4 (2 kids are both early 20‚Äôs) it was our first trip to see the falls.    Arrived Niagara Falls NY about 5:30pm. Settled into our hotel room at the DoubleTree then headed straight to Maid of the Mist.    We arrived at MOTM around 7:10pm (it closed at 8pm). Purchased our tix right at the kiosk (no line) and went straight to the boat. No lines at all; waited about 20 minutes for the previous boat to dock and then got right on board.    Viewing the falls via Maid of the Mist was AMAZING. It‚Äôs unbelievable how close you get to the falls. We stood on the top deck of the boat and got drenched but laughed and enjoyed every second! We have the BEST pictures. Highly recommend! After MOTM we just walked around the overlook and state park it was a lovely evening!    Random trip Notes:    When trying to find Maid of the Mist type in Hyatt Place as your GPS destination. We typed MOTM and it took us to random places in the state park/closed roads/etc. We finally figured it out lol. MOTM is located just across the street from Hyatt Place.    We found street parking ($5/hour) near Hyatt Place. The area where we parked around Hyatt Place was busy/touristy. It made me glad our hotel was 5 minutes away from the action lol.    We brought a reusable grocery store bag to store our shoes wallets purse keys etc. during the boat ride. We had flip flops in the bag and switched out when we boarded the boat/and changed back after we exited the boat. Worked great.    The ponchos did a fairly good job keeping our clothes dry. Sure they were a little wet but they dried out quickly during our walk around the state park.    While I would have LOVED to stay in Ontario at a hotel with a view (which was the original plan but dang the long passport delays arggh) - the NY side ended up totally fine. Car lines to both bridges were busy when we drove by so given our limited time I‚Äôm glad we opted to stay in NY. We will go to Ontario next time for sure though!!!    The DoubleTree was actually a great hotel! Booked last minute. Our room had a river view. Checked in/out with the Hilton app. Got our digital key with the Hilton app. Super easy. Clean room/comfy beds. Very generous with the complementary warm gooey chocolate chip cookies that we picked up every time we passed the front desk.    When deciding on dinner we ended up just eating at our hotel‚Äôs restaurant Parkway at the DoubleTree. It was delightful outdoor patio dining with a (limited) cute view of the river. Props to the good local craft beer they had on tap.    If we had any extra time would have done Cave of the Winds; but honestly after MOTM we were content with our overall experience at Niagara Falls.    Departed the hotel at 8am the following morning feeling super happy that we decided to experience Niagara Falls! Hope this helps someone have a great trip!!! ,Daisy,Niagara Falls,"Columbus, Ohio"

We just got to our house on Cayuga lake and the mosquitoes are out of control. The back door and windows are absolutely covered in them. There were a ton inside and I spent the night vacuuming them away from the ceiling light. It's 8am and there are currently so many on the patio door screen that I don't want to open the door to go outside because they'll all fly into the house.    Before I call the rental company when they open at 9 is this normal? I did all the reading on the forums and people said mosquitoes are not too bad. I recognize that there are going to be bugs lakeside. But there are just... so many. Plus so many spiders. It feels like they own this house and we're just borrowing it.    I try to be realistic about what to expect and I really don't know what to do at this point. ,ColinW,Finger Lakes,Philadelphia...

Hi everyone!  Looking for some advice or any recommendations.  Attending a wedding in New York next year. At the moment the first week of October is looking likely.  Where to look online for larger 5 bed accommodation? There will be 8-10 people.  Normally for these things we just book an Airbnb or similar and all good‚Ä¶ but i see that in New York things the laws are different.  Obviously staying in the same hotel is possible but we love the vibe of having the family together.  Are there possibilities? Or I suppose recommendations of hotels etc that do groups?  First choice area would be Manhattan or Williamsburg/Brooklyn but happy to look elsewhere. Any other great areas for tourists wanting to see the sights and explore??  Flexible budget- $15k ?? Ok? Possible? No chance?  All advice/tips welcomed and appreciated!!  And finally!- looking to find a place for a great dinner/night.  Maybe a group of 15-20 . We will have two 18 year old girls will that be problematic? (Apart from the obvious üòÄ) not really sure how it works‚Ä¶ I understand the no drinking bit‚Ä¶ but are they allowed in bars etc? Does it differ from place to place?  Thanks for any help! ,Marty,New York City,"Melbourne, Australia"

I am traveling solo with our 3 kids (141310) to NYC for 4 nights this October for their fall break. We‚Äôve been to NYC twice with our kids including this June 2023. We‚Äôve stayed at Casablanca Hotel both previous times in the theater district because they have a great room that fits 5 when we travel with my husband. We loved the small hotel vibe with included breakfast and that we were easily able to take the stairs to/from our room. Times Square isn‚Äôt our favorite location but we do love the hotel and proximity to the theaters. This time I was able to book our favorite family suite at Casablanca for Friday/Saturday night but it isn‚Äôt available for Wednesday/Thursday. I‚Äôm wanting to find another hotel that is somewhat similar in another area of town to explore. Looking for a smallish hotel in an area with lots of character and local shops/restaurants/coffee shops. I‚Äôd love a non high rise hotel that we can easily take the stairs to our room (after an unfortunate/scary incident where we were stuck in an airport parking garage elevator we have a family member that strongly prefers not to take elevators when possible). We are ok with taking stairs up to 6 stories and consider it good exercise. We‚Äôve already seen a lot of the tourist sights on our past trips so this trip will be fairly relaxed. Food is a big part of our trips and we love exploring new restaurants and food related places. We really enjoyed Eataly Chelsea Market and exploring Hells Kitchen our past trip this June. Some areas we may want to visit include Central Park Highline Tenement Museum Brooklyn Bridge/DUMBO MOMA Chinatown Little Italy and revisit Chelsea Market. We also plan on seeing a show or 2 when we stay at Casablanca. 3 hotels that have piqued my interest and have availability for a room for 4 (all similar prices) include:    Ludlow  Wallace  Ned Nomad    A few others that are more high rise (would require elevator) but we would consider if they are better overall choices:    1 Hotel Central Park (mid October near the park might be beautiful)    1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (seems like a cool hotel and could explore Brooklyn/DUMBO area but maybe too far removed from other sights).    Thompson Central Park    Wall Street Hotel (hotel seems cool but not sure about location)    Others we‚Äôve considered but are either too expensive or no rooms for 4: Greenwich Hotel Soho Grand Hotel Chelsea Marlton Walker Whitby and Crosby Street.      Any thoughts on which we should choose? ,Sarah C,New York City,TN

For many reasons (two beds in a room for one) we have my son and I have narrowed down a 3 night stay in August between the Omni Berkshire and westin Times Square; we have read the reviews. On one hand the Westin is close to the lights and it might be more exciting for a guy in his 30s. But the Omni sounds slightly nicer and quieter on Madison.

Has anyone used trip.come to buy Summit tix? They‚Äôre much cheaper than the official website and with the poor exchange rate with the Canadian dollar I‚Äôd love to save $$ when possible.    Also there are tix available for 5:30pm or 7pm. Sunset is expected to happen at 7:30ish‚Ä¶. Would booking for 5:30 be too early for both daytime and sunset views?

Looking for a trip partner for newyork in mid octber for one week ,Abdul Q,New York City,"Tando Adam, Pakistan"
Hi all. We are coming to NYC 9/22-9/25 for a quick trip to see the Book of Hov. I used to live in NYC so familiar with and happy to take the subway everywhere. Since we are doing Brooklyn and Manhattan figured midtown was best bet since coming in from LGA. I have boy-girl teens who obviously do not want to share a bed so I am looking for two beds and a sofa bed or rollaway. Reviews for most of the hotels with this option are abysmal so I narrowed it down to the Riu Times Square and Manhattan and Luma which has double kings. I am honestly not thrilled with any of these options but they seem to be the best bets based on reviews. Would like to stay around $1800 for the 3 nights. Do we suck it up and get a nicer hotel with two queens? Is there any difference between Riu Manhattan vs Times Square? They seem fairly identical online. Is there anything else I should be looking at? Thanks for any help! ,Elita B,New York City,
Are there any overnight secure parking places at the Amtrak station?  How safe is station area at late night ?  Thanks ,Mper1377,Yonkers,Philadelphia...

I want to experience Amtrak Adirondack to view foliage on weekend of Oct 678.  (I have previously driven to white face mountain/lake placid upto Montreal via lake champlain)    This time i want to experience Amtrak Adirondack starting from NYC on Friday morning and return Sunday. We are family of 2 4 kids kids age 131297.  I need advise if Amtrak Adirondack is good for a relaxed fall viewing train ride ?  I was looking at rental car and seems like plattsburgh is a town that has some rental car options.    I guess my main question here is train ride / trip to plattsburgh worthy? ,Mper1377,Adirondacks,Philadelphia...
It looks like we're going to be spending one of our days in midtown---probably between about 42nd street to Central Park.    Definitely Planned:  Lunch (soup dumpling lover) - Joe's Home of Soup Dumplings  Explore/walk around Times Square and Rockefeller Center  Treats at Sugar Factory and/or Bibble & Sip and/or Schmackary's  Shop along 5th Avenue    Questions  -DINNER: We're thinking Ellen's Stardust or Tao ---Any different suggestions? They are adventurous eaters and it would be mostly about the experience/atmosphere/etc. (And yes I get that Ellens and Tao are very different options... Haha)  -Any other suggestions for teen experiences? [We've done some of the more obvious ones like Top of the Rock roller skating there Madame Tussauds various Broadway shows etc.] ,portersquarefamily,New York City,Boston...
Taking a couple of teenage girls to New York City. Any fun new-ish food trends / think viral/Instagrammable types of stuff. Girls are adventurous eaters.

For treats/experiences we're thinking about Cha Cha Matcha Blank Slate Tea and Sugar Factory.    All advice welcome!    (We will mostly be in midtown Time Square Soho and West / Village.

Our family visited NYC during the first week of August. For some context my husband and I have been to New York several times separately but this was the first time together with our kids (ages 14 and 12) so we wanted to hit some of the major attractions. I used wisdom and advice from TA plus Free Tours on Foot and other blogs and videos to plan. I also relied on Google Maps and CityMapper to figure out how to get around.    Overall we had a great visit but melted in the heat and we'll never take a decent public restroom for granted ever again.    I'll provide each day's recap in a separate post.    Day 1    We caught a very early flight at 6:45 am from Toronto to LaGuardia and had a good experience with Delta. My husband heard about the beautiful terminal Delta built at the airport and wanted us to land there to see it. We then had a strange trip into the city because our Yellow Cab driver would weave in the lane or drive so slowly in the tunnels other cars would honk in irritation. I whispered to the kids this is not a New York driver. He wouldn't listen to the GPS instructions and I could see my husband in the front trying to communicate with him. When we got out we realized he may have had special needs and that was the reason for his behavior.    Due to unforeseen circumstances two weeks before our trip we had to switch hotels from a location near Times Square to stay at The Kimberly Suites at Lexington and 50th St W. The hotel had old school New York style with gloved porters and doormen to help with luggage and open doors for us. We had a very spacious one bedroom suite with sofa bed and a kitchenette. I'll post a link to my review here later.    After dropping off our luggage my husband was adamant about seeing Central Park specifically the Reservoir so we took a subway uptown. It was our first time using the subway and we found the system easy to use and economical using it every day. We walked from the station to Central Park and there were beautiful views of the city across the water and a lot of people running and walking dogs. But the early morning start to the day combined with the heat had me and the kids wilting fast. Also nature walks were our go-to during Covid so my kids are now less than enthusiastic about spending too much time look at trees and water. We lasted an hour or so before deciding to head to Times Square.    We arrived at Grand Central Station and admired the architecture but finding a restroom was becoming urgent. We headed downstairs and it was lunch hour madness. Of course the ladies room had a line-up down the length of the hall while the men happily flitted to and from the mens room. Shake Shack was on our bucket list since they aren't in Canada but the wait time didn't look good. We walked to Bryant Park and found another Shake Shack there. I thought my burger was absolutely delicious and we loved their crinkle cut fries. Alas no restroom here either.    We walked to Times Square which was lively and exciting but our need to pee had us preoccupied with trying to find a restroom. We hardly looked around any stores properly because we were too busy scoping for a restroom. As we would say throughout the entire trip how in the world do parents with little kids survive? My bladder was lamenting giving up that Times Square hotel.    We gave up and sat on the red stairs (Glee fans here) to take in the view and people watch. One of the things we noticed arriving in NYC was the hustle culture. From the fruit ladies to the bus tour pushers to the costumed characters. I get it; everyone needs to make a living. For some reason people kept approaching my oldest son while we were hanging out. I didn't notice at first but my husband did and told a guy to beat it.    We were hot and exhausted and our hotel room was ready so we took the subway there. While were happy to rest in the AC and finally pee my husband wanted to absorb as much of NYC as possible. So he went exploring near the hotel and one of the places he stopped by was Essa-A-Bagel. It was busy so he went back a little bit later to buy half a dozen bagels so we could make good use of the kitchenette in our room. Even though he only asked for half a dozen the man at the store insisted he take a dozen. My husband came back with 18 bagels!    I had a reservation for us at Gayle's Broadway Rose later that evening. This was to make up for our decision not to get tickets to a Broadway show. I had tried several times to explain the singing server concept only to receive blank looks. But once we walked into Friedman's and they heard the singing they were instantly mesmerized. My youngest complained it was too loud but he also enjoyed the performances. We heard songs from Aladdin Hamilton Grease Wicked and many more. They also served our food quickly and it was really good (Cobb Salad chicken and waffles quinoa bowl).    Afterwards we walked around Rockefeller Plaza and tried to visit the LEGO and Nike stores but there were line-ups. Instead we went inside St. Patrick's Cathedral. Except for my husband we're practicing Catholics and took time to make offerings and say a prayer. But whether your religious or not the architecture and art are absolutely beautiful to look at.    I have RA and my joints were not happy from walking all day even after breaks. We took the subway back and decided to split up me and the kids would go to the hotel while my husband tried to find the nearby Trader Joe's (another must-do that we don't have in Canada) to get fruit and other things for breakfast and snacking. ,Book Momma,New York City,Toronto

Moving my daughter into the dorms at FIT for her freshman year this weekend. Can't believe it! So nervous... she's only 17. Stressing big time!  Anyway looking for recommendations of coffee places cafes restaurants etc. that are on the cheap side for when she wants to take a break from the FIT dining plan. Cheap means Sweetgreen prices for example. $10-15. She's vegan so not needing vegan only restaurants but looking for places with cheaper options on the menu and some vegan options. Already have Playa Bowls Sweetgreen Beatnic and Grey Dog on the list.  Any idea/suggestions? Thanks! ,caroline1851,New York City,Connecticut

Going to be staying in NYC for 2 months this fall. Will be staying in Columbus Circle area so Lincoln Center TKTS will be much closer (and prefer avoiding Times Square unless going to a show). Are the lines at the Lincoln Center location similarly as long? I assume same tickets available at all locations? Based on what's been happening lately do you think I will be able to get tickets (mostly just 2 but maybe 3-5 for some) for Six Sweeny Todd Hamilton and MJ (I'm guessing MJ is a yes). Have been to NYC many many times (our kids live there) and usually i buy our tickets in advance as just there for a week or so but since going to be there for such a long time I thought I would do TKTS but would buy in advance again if hard to get any of these.

Hey all - My wife and I are from Australia and we are coming to USA for 5 weeks this December. It is on our bucket list to see NY at Christmas time. We are flying into JFK on 14th Nov and pln to take the train to Washington DC  get a car and check out that area and drive back to NY and hand in rental car on 22nd Nov. We are staying in Library Hotel Maddison Ave for 2 night so we can see the thanksgiving parade (a highlight for my wife). We will then get another car and take a two week road trip up the coast to Maine and come back inland through New Hampshire Vermont etc.) returning to NY on Dec 11th for 8 nights. We are booked at Crowne PLaza Times Square. A few Questions....    1. Is it practical for me to drive back into hotel in Maddison Ave to return rental car? How crazy is it to drive in NY (especially someone used to driving on the left side of the road) !! Other ideas?    2. Same question in terms of getting out of NY to head up the coast. I had thought of catching train up to Boston but we would like to spend some time exploring Newport and Cape Cod and so driving from NY seems to be the best for that.    3. Any suggestions of best spot to see Thanksgiving parade? I suspect closer to the beginning of the parade is better so we are not spending as long out in the cold but the library Hotel where we are staying is near Bryant Park which I believe is a good place to watch? Ideas?    4. Any worthwhile discount passes for various attractions or tours for the 8 days we are there?    Thanks for your help ,Gavin L,New York City,Shellharbour...

Hi all    Myself and my partner are planning on going to New York this Christmas on the 23rd-28th.    Any advice from anyone on the UK if there's a chance to get any last minute package deals or is it best just booking it now?

Hello  My friend and I will be traveling to NYC in Sept. After a few days in NYC we are spending a few days near Stockbridge MA and are trying to figure out the best way to get there.  We are thinking of taking a train from NYC to Albany-Rensselaer but would have to then catch a cab/UBER to take us the hour to our destination. Wondering if cab/Uber would be easy to get if traveling an hour into Massachusetts and if so are there any can company recommendations - or will they be lined up at the train station.    I‚Äôm also looking at a bus option with Peter Pan bus company which would take us close to our destination but it only runs once a day from Port Authority and we have to be there for a workshop that starts at a specific time so I worry about the reliability.  If it‚Äôs easy to catch an Uber from Albany to Stockbridge/Lenox I may do that going there and take the bus back.    Any info is appreciated!  Thank you. ,Jennifer N,Albany,"Vancouver, Canada"

I've been looking into booking the margaritaville resort now for the last week or so. Today after reading lots of reviews and watching lots of YouTube videos I finally decided that is the place I wanted to stay and was all set to book it this evening. I have just stumbled across various articles stating that it is facing foreclosure after failing to make a 57 million dollar repayment.    The holiday is for a special occasion in may 2024 and is almost ¬£5000. I want to get sorted early as flights are already selling fast but I'm in a predicament I know this issue could drag on for months and months by which time the flights I need will probably be sold out. I don't really want to book elsewhere if this place will still be open under new owners.    I had a situation on my previous visit to Manhattan where I had booked to stop at the double tree Suites times square and at the last minute I was told that the hotel was closing down I had to sort another hotel out but because it was so close to the holiday then there were barely any suitable hotels left. I got sorted in the end after days of stressful phone calls so I don't want to be in that situation again.    Am I foolish to book the Margaritaville? ,Ray Donovan,New York City,"England, United..."

Flew first class on Delta to JFK. Never flown Delta before and I was disappointed in the leg room. We were front row and my crossed foot was hitting the wall. Food was good and service was good. We had booked through Costco so this included transfers. Our driver was 30 mins late and we weren't happy about that at all. It took us 1.5 hours to get from JFK to Marriott Marquis at noon on a Wednesday so heads up about that. Checked into our suite on 27th floor. A separate living room and bedroom but very small bathroom. Didn't make sense for the size of the room. Had two fridges and a bar area which worked out great for us as we brought our own alcohol and some protein drinks etc. That day we really just walked around and had dinner and drinks on the terrace at the Marriott and ended up spreading some serious money out to the girls in the strip clubs in times square area LOL. Passed out drunk around 10pm as we had been up since 3am for flight.    Thursday-I woke up at 5am to hit the gym which is very nice at the hotel. We walked to central park and then started drinking our way through the Plaza hotel Trump Tower Rockefeller Center while doing some shopping at LV and MK. Eventually made our way to Hudson Yards to the Quin bar and wandered that area. We had dinner reservations at Club A Steakhouse at 7pm so we took a cab there. This guy had absolutely no idea of where he was going and it took us 45 mins to go not even 2 miles as he went waaaayyyyyy out of the way and was almost $35 before tip! We get to the restaurant and we are seated in a nice table upstairs by the window. Our server came over and literally couldn't care less that we were there. Never introduced himself NOTHING. What also bothered me was there was blaring music right above me and not even good like steakhouse music you'd expect in something high end. We ended up walking out and walking to Wolfgangs Steakhouse. Dinner was $330 before tip and I thought it was a decent meal. Headed back to Marriot via Uber for $19 and took less than 10 minutes. Called it an night.  Friday-Woke up early to hit gym and went to the highline before we hit Carbone for our 11:45 reservation. Took cab there for $35. I thought the meal was decent. Service on point. It was $214 and we ended up walking all the way back to TS from there. Shopping and drinking along the way. We literally had just gone through Union Square before all that total BS started to happen!! We ended up staying inside the Marriott as I wasn't sure where the group of animals was going to go and I wasn't getting caught up in that BS. I hope he spends time in jail and has to pay for all that cost to clean up that whole area!!!    Saturday-Walked Brooklyn Bridge and had some Mexican food in financial district which was pretty decent and Ubered back to hotel. Walked around times square and went to Gallaghers for a drink before walking around hotel area and calling it an early evening. We changed our flight from Monday to Sunday first thing as we didn't want to get caught up in the bad weather coming in Monday afternoon. And honestly I was happy to go. I was just done and wanted to get home. I remember NYC when we went in 2017 was a much better experience for us. This time it was so beyond crowded and several times I had to tell the performers in TS to not touch me as they went to grab my hand or hug me numerous times. Driver picked us up at 4:30am and was falling asleep on our drive to JFK. I wasn't happy about that at all. We were also picked up in a wrecked old Camry! Not what I was expecting as on way to Marriot we were in a Lincoln Aviator. Flight back home on Delta plane was awesome as the first class was the new one on a 4 month old plane. We'd go on Delta again but only on the new A class planes!    We spent $5200 in 4 days for the two of us for drinking eating and shopping but everything was on the high end wise.

We are flying from PHX to Buff to meet family for a long weekend in early October but I‚Äôm going to add a whirlwind stop in NYC with my 16yr old daughter. We are taking a redeye landing at 6:30am and leaving the next day at 2:30pm. I‚Äôve been to the City a few times but it‚Äôs been over a decade since I‚Äôve been there and my daughter has never been. My goal is to hit the highlights.    What do you think? I know there is SO much more to explore but we simply don‚Äôt have the time this trip. Can you fill in some gaps help with subway routes etc?    My thoughts are:  Drop bags off at the hotel (Times Square area)    Breakfast - need suggestions    Thinking of heading south first- WTC Wall Street IF time either Battery Park or one of the quick 1-hr boats to see Statue of Liberty (not getting off at Ellis Isle).    Then to Little Italy area: pizza at Lombardis goodies at Ferrara    Travel to & explore Rockefeller Center Radio City Times Square    Check in to hotel get cleaned up    Broadway show - thinking Wicked or Lion King    Late dinner - need suggestions  Maybe super late dessert stop -need suggestions    Morning: breakfast - need suggestions    Central Park fountain Strawberry Fields walk back down 5th Ave    Maybe grab a quick lunch if time    Get bags & head to LGA for our 2:30pm flight to Buffalo ,MommaCG,New York City,"Phoenix, Arizona"

Hello again everyone.    Wondered if I could trouble you for subway route check / advice if possible? On my previous trips I‚Äôve stayed at the Hilton at 52nd/Lex Ave and used air train and then E train ( I think?!)‚Ä¶ staying elsewhere this time so I think my route is:    JFK Terminal 8 - Airtrain Red - Jamaica - E train - 42nd St/Port Auth    Or:    JFK Terminal 8 - Airtrain Green - Howard Beach - A train - 42nd St/Port Auth    Those are right?    What about the LIRR? That isn‚Äôt coming up on my route planner as an option?    In terms of Airtrain I assume we still have to buy a physical metro card and load 4 x $8.25 ($34) into it? However the 10 trip $25 would be cheaper - does the machine give the option to buy that instead? Remind me when it asks for zip code I enter 00000?    We plan to subway around so would normally get the 7 day metro card but now I think I‚Äôm right in thinking that we can tap and pay on our phones and when we reach the cost of the 7 day card we are capped and won‚Äôt be charged any more rides?    Thanks all! ,vickilewis626,New York City,"Scarborough, United..."

A bit of a different trip report this is road trip from Queens to Alexandria Bay (1000 Islands)    I left Queens at 7am and my first stop was in Albany. I stop by the state capital at the Empire Plaza Its actually pictureresque there especially since it was very empty. The NY Capital is actually quite nice but it doesnt look like most state capitals because it doesnt have a dome    I then walked past the egg and then I found a civil war statue in front of the Capital of Philip Sheridan (you know I am looking for that...and this wasnt the last one that I found)    My next stop was the Philip Schuyler house Schulyer was the father in law of Hamilton. Unforunatly I got there at 10:15 and the first tour wasnt until 11am. with all the driving left I had to pass on the tour in this direction Maybe I will stop on the way home    My next stop was Oriksany state Battlefield site in Orisany NY but before I got there I crosses the Erie canal I had never actually seen the erie canal before so I stopped.    The Battle of Oriksany occured on Aug 6 1777 (I was there on the anniversary but they didnt have much going on there  but there was a cool obelisk there. My next stop was fort Standwix in Rome NY is related to Oriksany and is reconsructed revolutuinary war fort. At the fort they told me about the Steunen Monument in remsen  NY. It seemed it was mostly on the way to Alexandria Bay NY so I stopped there for 15 mins. Its the grave site of revolutionary war hero Steuben    As I am driving up to Alexandria Bay in Lowvyille NY I see a civil war Monument in the middle of the street of course I stop to photo graph it    I finally made it Alexandria Bay this is a pretty cool town right on the St Lawarence river (At least its cool in the summer I wouldnt want to be here in the winter) ,Queenstravelbuff,,New York City
https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/Tempo-Hilton-Times-Square-grand-opening    This new build is where Doubletree Suites Times Square used to be: 1568 Broadway at the corner of W. 47th Street. Right across the street from the TKTS booth and the red stair steps of Duffy Square.    At 235-268 square feet the Tempo‚Äôs standard rooms are somewhat larger than what‚Äôs become the new normal (~200 sq feet or less) for most new NYC hotels; all have floor-to-ceilings windows and e.g. a mini fridge. And unlike many NYC hotels the 2-bedded rooms are outfitted with 2 queen beds not the smaller double/full ones. Connecting rooms can be booked in the hotel‚Äôs own website. There is no resort/destination fee.    Wraparound outdoor terrace the Ball Drop units & the Presidential Suite are expected to be available in the very near future.    Looks like it could be a great addition to the Times Square-Theatre District area especially for those who want to earn or use Hilton Honors points.  https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nyctepo-tempo-new-york-times-square/ ,CockleCove,New York City,"New York City, New..."

Hello    My friends and I just booked a Saturday at the spa on Governor's island for my friends 40th bday. The admission includes the ferry ride and provides 3 options. We are coming from Jersey and trying to decide which makes the most sense.  Option 1 - South Street  Option 2 - Pier 6 Brooklyn Bridge Park  Option 3 - Red Hook/Atlantic Basin    We thought only option 1 existed and were planning to drive to the Staten Island ferry parking there and taking the two ferries to get to Governor's Island. If there is a more direct ride from Brooklyn that was quicker and easier we would consider it. Are there parking lots/garages available by either of the Brooklyn terminals within walking distance?    The drive to all terminals from my home is about an 45 minutes so that is not a factor.    Any advice is appreciated. TY! ,Christina M,Brooklyn,
Hello    In the second half of October my wife and me wanted to organize a trip to New York (our first time) from Finland.    We were thinking of staying for 7/8 nights and visiting the main attractions. I have a few questions about it:    1) How to get to the city from JFK? I tried to look it up a bit and the options seem to be the Metro or Taxi/Uber/Lyft. With two large suitcases and two trolleys I assume the Metro should be avoided right? How much would a ride from JFK to let's say Midtown cost?    2) For getting around downtown is it better to use a Metro Card or OMNY? It seems they are changing the fare cap in OMNY so that it's valid for 7 days from the first use and not from Monday to Sunday.    3) Do you have any hotels to recommend as well as areas to recommend or not recommend? For now we've found something affordable (under $350 per day) near Central Park South.    4) Which SIM card is recommended? Data only or should it include calls too? Any suggestions? Do I get it online as eSim or can I get it at the airport?    5) I've seen discussions about various passes but I'm not sure yet which one is the best. The attractions that interest us are Top of The Rock perhaps Edge the Museum of Natural History a cruise around the Statue of Liberty maybe 9/11 Memorial maybe Bronx Zoo and possibly a ride on the HopOn-HopOff.    6) We'll definitely visit Dumbo and the Brooklyn Bridge.    7) Almost all the hotels don't include breakfast (or if it's included the price goes up significantly). Is there anything affordable for breakfast? (Silly question I know.) Same goes for lunch and dinner.    8) In a stay of 7/8 nights is it worth splitting the hotels like half in the central area and half in the south? Or is it better to stay in just one place and avoid unnecessary moves with luggage?    9) Safety aspect how is it? Is it safe to move around at least until 10:00-10:30 pm?    If there's anything I've forgotten and is a must-see please let me know!    Thank you very much! ,Andrea R,New York City,"Espoo, Finland"
Hi all    We are visiting in October and are looking for somewhere for a quiet Friday night drink on the UWS maybe a wine bar or a craft beer place in easy walking distance of the Beacon Hotel (planning ahead for after a long day and a lot of steps).

Hello everyone. We are a family travelling to Europe in a week for my brother's birthday. My brother studies in USA and applied for his Schengen visa from there via Denmark. It has been more than 30 calendar days with no response. The rest of us got our visas from India despite the high number of applications. But Americans don't even require short stay visa for Europe so why are the applications so delayed there?    Is there anything we can do to expedite the process or get more information since all our bookings are done. He already sent an email to the Consulate in New York where his visa is processing but has received no reply. Their phone lines for visa automatically redirect to VFS which offers no assistance.    Is it rude to send another email or call on a number other than the one meant for visas? I am just looking for some information so we don't have to make this trip without him on his birthday. ,Travelust11,,

We haven‚Äôt picked hotel yet our dinner choices may influence that‚Ä¶    2. Dinner - in the past we have had fun and enjoyed the food at STK and Tao Downtown‚Ä¶ anything new that is similar? Prefer larger spaces nothing quaint no tiny tables no pre-fixe or experiences like a la carte steak Asian Latin. Maybe Italian or open on cuisine if all other factors are there‚Ä¶ Bonus if there‚Äôs music and a buzzy atmosphere‚Ä¶ upscale or moderate also would like to dress nicer.

Going to N.Y. for a few days next month and want to go to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Don't want an organised walking tour around just to be left to our own to see and experience it all in our own time. What's the best way of doing it? Do we buy tickets beforehand and if so where's the best place to buy them? Is it easy to get to - we're staying in a hotel at Times Square.

We only have one contactless credit card between us. We thought that would be no problem as we read we could buy up to four tickets each time we got on the bus. I have read somewhere that the first time I use the card I can only buy one ticket - is that correct?

Hi we have just returned from a brilliant week in New Yorkthe weather has been brilliant high 70s even in the 80 degreesit was great walking around in shorts and polo shirtswe stayed in the Riu plaza Manhattan Times Square hotelit was very busy we had a lovely room on the 9th floor.  Wednesdaywe went to the Summit one Vanderbilt that was excellent then had lunch in grand central in the evening we went to watch MJ The musical recommend the show.  Thursday it was really hot by lunch time fortunately we went on a guided bike tour of Central Park early morn then did the Roosevelt tramway over to the island in the evening evening we did the Circleline harbour lights cruise again that was brilliant to see the city lights in the evening.  Friday it was my daughter‚Äôs 30th birthday we went to see the flatiron building then we visited Klenfeld before walking over to the high really enjoyed that then went to the edge another great time up there and in the evening we went to see the Moulin Rouge fantastic show.  Saturday went to Coney Island didn‚Äôt stay long wasn‚Äôt really impressed got the subway to walk Dumbo and over Brooklyn bridge and into ground zero .  Sunday was to mass at 10 15 at St Patrick‚Äôs then we hit the shops Sunday evening did the Rockerfella in the evening to see the city lights that was spectacular.  Monday finished shopping and unfortunately had to go to the airport  I would recommend using the subway and get the 33 dollars 7 day pass  We had a great time in New York really enjoyed it  We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe and Friedmans they are excellent for coeliac and have a great gluten free menu finally we used to finish in the Longacre tavern for a couple of well earned beers . ,361culsh,New York City,"Manchester, United..."
My co-founder and I are heading to the city in September for 2-4 weeks to meet and pitch to business angels for our startup. We're a team of two (male and female not Americans) and are on the hunt for affordable housing during our stay. As a couple we're seeking housing options and are budgeting $150-200/day.    We're considering subletting but we're open to suggestions. Does anyone have experience with short-term sublets or can recommend any areas or platforms where we can find reliable listings? While we've looked into subletting we're also considering hotels hostels or any other alternative accommodation. Given this budget and duration what would you recommend? Where would you stay if you were in our shoes?    We'd appreciate any suggestions personal experiences or insights on where to find reliable listings or deals.    Thanks in advance and looking forward to experiencing the city's vibrant business scene! ,Cretu N,New York City,
Hi All    Looking at booking a few days at the Feather Factory Hotel near 33 Street/Rawson Street.    Google suggests that we get the AirTrain JFK Red towards To Jamaica Station from Terminal 4. Then walk to Sutphin Blvd - Archer Av station and get the E train (towards World Trade centre) to Jackson Heights then change to 7 train to 33 Street/Rawson Street.    All sounds easy but how simple is it to get between stations and is it easily signposted given that we arent locals.    Or am I just better looking at a cab/transfer. We will be using the subway quite a bit anyway as we are staying for 5 days so was thinking of getting a payment card or similar.    Many thanks  Martin ,Martin M,New York City,"Bridgend, United..."

My 8th-grade daughter and I are returning to NYC in a few weeks after a 3-year hiatus (we spent a long weekend there every fall from 1st-5th grade). We have/had a tradition of having afternoon tea each visit at a different place. We've been to BG The Russian Tea Room the Met the Whitby Hotel and the Plaza. I'm not sure if it's just post-COVID or I'm missing something but all but one of those locations had a gluten-free afternoon tea option. Now I'm only seeing one at The Russian Tea Room. I've looked at other places that were on our tea list and I'm seeing zero GF menus. Does anyone have a bead on a place that might have a GF afternoon tea service option (and not just a regular menu with GF options like salad)? ,EHScott,New York City,Catonsville...

I don't know where the time has gone but we just realized it has been almost 10 years since our last visit to Saratoga for the races. This time we're staying at the Courtyard using Marriott points and of course plan to spend our days at the track.    But we're looking for some restaurant suggestions for Sunday and Monday nights. Maybe your favorite casual place and upscale place? Also some place to have drinks would be great too. We like all types of food and while we don't like to overspend we don't mind a pricey meal (let's say $150 for two) when it demonstrates great quality and innovation. But hey we also love a good burger joint :-)    FYI. The last time we were there dining at a lovely place the chef literally quit halfway through the meal. We enjoyed our apps but never got to finish. We ended up getting pizza across the street. Too funny.    Thanks in advance for your help! ,jtwiz,Saratoga Springs,"Pt. Pleasant, NJ"
Hi  Coming over soon from the UK and was wondering should I buy a sim card before I travel (Tmobile about ¬£40 for 15 days with 5GB) or wait until we are in NYC and buy from an AT&T or Verizon store?

My friend & I are going to be attending this year's U.S. Open on September 1st & 2nd.    Originally my thought was to park my car in some lot in Brooklyn where we're staying for the entirety of when we're there. That's still a viable option.    But I got to thinking that we could drive from our accommodations to the tennis facility. The U.S. Open site says that parking would be $40 there. That's a non-starter (too expensive) so I wanted to check in with locals about whether there might be less expensive options available within 10 blocks?    Robert ,Robert Werner,Queens,
Hello    My friends and I just booked a Saturday at the spa on Governor's island for my friends 40th bday. The admission includes the ferry ride and provides 3 options. We are coming from Jersey and trying to decide which makes the most sense.    Option 1 - South Street    Option 2 - Pier 6 Brooklyn Bridge Park    Option 3 - Red Hook/Atlantic Basin    We thought only option 1 existed and were planning to drive to the Staten Island ferry parking there and taking the two ferries to get to Governor's Island. If there is a more direct ride from Brooklyn that was quicker and easier we would consider it. Are there parking lots/garages available by either of the Brooklyn terminals within walking distance?    The drive to all terminals from my home is about an 45 minutes so that is not a factor.    Any advice is appreciated. TY! ,Christina M,New York City,

To cut a long story short we were supposed to come in 2020 but covid struck and as they were smaller in age and size then it wasn't so much of an issue to share a bed then.

We arrive on the 5th and wondered if any holiday decorations will still be up (Rockefeller tree for example). I know this gets asked every year but I never had occasion to file that info away in my brain.  Also we are coming into see Spamalot and have a suite at the Wallace booked and one at the Broadway Plaza hotel. As much as I love the UWS and really want to stay at the Wallace I am thinking that the BP might be more convenient to the show and it could be fun to explore somewhere different. I'm still torn though and welcome any votes. My family is no help as they don't really care and cheaper (Broadway Plaza) is pretty much all they are considering when comparing.  Finally is the Museum of Mathematics mostly geared at younger kids? I had it on my list of places to go but never really stopped and looked at their website before. It looks like it might be geared towards kiddos but curious if I have that right.  Thanks for chiming in on any part of that! ,wren341,New York City,

We are staying in Montauk next month for three nights and then returning to Massachusetts. Seven years ago I was driving to Hauppauge every week and took the ferry to and from New London many times and loved it but now we have a small dog. I see that dogs are allowed on at least some of the boats but are restricted as to where they can go on board. When I was working in Hauppauge I was not a dog owner and never noticed if there were dogs on the ferries. Does anyone have any specific knowledge of this? Do I need to call the ferry to make sure I am booking a boat that allows dogs? Would we have to sit on deck or in our car? ,OriginalThomas144,Long Island,Winchester...

Hello all been a long while since I have been here (this forum and your wonderful city) and have mostly planned my 5 day solo trip 8/12-8/16. The trip is meant to be a soul search/escape full of trying new things/foods/experiences. Staying at The Flat NYC private room/shared bath decided to go budget accommodations to increase food/drinks budget. Thank you in advanced for any advice or help offered it is greatly appreciated and sorry for bad formatting or any mistakes - I‚Äôm on mobile as the laptop took a drink today.    Saturday:  - Flight lands at 7 am will likely grab a coffee and snack at the airport and leisurely head into Manhattan near hotel (24th at between 5th and 6th for those unaware) via AirTraun and subway. Check bags with hotel.  - go to Strand bookstore and get an old school real life book for the stay  - go to one of the three legal cannabis dispensaries. I‚Äôve researched the three and will likely try them all but any advice here (if allowed of course) appreciated.  - Find nearby coffee or bagel or pastry shop and chill out to read for a bit. Recommendations nearby appreciated  - likely time to kill here check in not until 3 or 4 pm thinking grand central or library or something along those lines. Also a store for basic toiletries or anything else I may use in hotel.  - check in and get ready for dinner - thinking Mistah Oh - and Hamilton at 8pm!  - pizza or something cheap and maybe drinks after. Any local dive bars in the hotel area? Depends on tiredness at that point.    Sunday: this will be a very heavy emotional day I understand.  - Wake up around 7 coffee and breakfast somewhere new and nearby. Would love to maybe try some tea or coffee alternative  - get to 9/11 museum for open at 9 and spend as much time as needed likely until around 12-1  - reflect and lunch in a quiet place if possible maybe grab something quick and find a bench  - museum of Jewish heritage IF emotionally possible if not reevaluate.  - dinner and very mellow night after this most likely maybe a late night observation deck will be slower late night Sunday not sure.    Monday:  - same morning routine start around 7 find a new local place for a morning pick me up/snack  - trek to fort Tyron park and walk the park before met cloisters opens at 10 giving at least 2 hours here  - lunch in that area good Dominican food or similar perhaps? Haven‚Äôt done much research here.  - ferry from midtown -> battery park -> Staten Island then back to lower Manhattan on SI ferry.  - depending on time either do some lower Manhattan sights (I like historical sights) Fraunces Tavern looks interesting or go back up to hotel and get ready  - want to spend the evening ‚Äúout‚Äù no limitations here really looking into DUMBO the Village etc want to pick an area and hangout for the night.    Tuesday:  - usual morning around 7am new place of course  - head to the high line and walk north to Hudson yards  - do Edge observatory  - pretty open after this as well was thinking of Tenement Museum and/or walking tour but I know the weather will likely be hot and humid. Might do AMNH and some Central Park here instead  - lunch and explore either lower Manhattan area maybe Chinatown if I do tenement museum or UWS or nearby if I do the latter.  - probably hotel to get ready and want to walk Brooklyn Bridge after dark. Probably do a dinner/drinks I have a sight in mind I have to go back to previous trip but I believe the something Fruit Promenade with awesome view and very cool townhomes nearby. Need to find  - after walking Brooklyn -> Manhattan over bridge likely call it a night    Wednesday: departure day. Need some advice here.    - flight leaves at 8pm I plan on shipping my luggage and just keep my small backpack with me for the day. Is this idea crazy?! Price will be comparable to checking the bag and I bought a ticket with no carry on (only personal item) allowed for the flight home. Since an 8pm flight makes me leave Manhattan in the middle of rush hour I had the idea of exploring much closer to JFK where perhaps there will be less rush hour impact. The kings manor museum was my first search for this but it is closed Wednesday. Any other ideas for something similar? Or should I not worry and plan another day in Manhattan until 5pm?  - checking out around 11 was going to possibly squeeze in the Met/AMNH or go off some of your advice here on departure day with regards to going closer to JFK.    Thank you if you made it this far please let me know if I have too much or not enough anywhere. Any food recs in the mentioned areas greatly appreciated I want to try everything and am not picky budget typically around 100 per day for food average but am certainly ready to go much higher than that. Also glad to see many familiar names here from my previous adventure. You all are awesome!    Cheers ,Dave W,New York City,"Buffalo, New York"
Would welcome any suggestions on our current plans:  Day 1 - arrive in the evening (hotel near penn st) late night outdoor cinema.  Day 2 - big bus down to WTC followed by WTC tour and museum. Late afternoon will be open for shopping around WTC and then late night trip up the Empire State Building.  Day 3 - Rise NY followed by the Ride in the morning. Afternoon - explore Times Square. No plans for the evening as of yet  Day 4 - TOTR followed by a 1 hour pedicab around Central Park and exploring the park on our own. Afternoon is a theatre show - MJ the musical. It‚Äôs my bday that day so would like to find a nice restaurant for the evening. A couple of people suggested buddakan?  Day 5 - the edge in the morning followed by a 90min circle line cruise. Last minute shopping before heading back to the airport at 4ish ,jaaackie1000,New York City,
Hello!    I'm taking my 81-year old mother to a concert at Madison Square Garden this Fall. We are both taking Amtrak from our respective home towns and meeting at Penn Station. She is in great shape but obviously we'd rather stay as close to Penn and MSG as we can. We don't plan to do a lot of walking around and sightseeing. The purpose of the trip is the concert and then we will head back home the next day.    I have enough hotel points to stay at eithe the Hampton Inn Madison Square Garden Area or the Fairfield Inn Penn Station. The Fairfield Inn is significantly less points. Both get good ratings but the most recent reviews for the Fairfield Inn are concerning. I realize for every bad review there are probably double the number of good reviews.    We plan to check in drop our bags and head to dinner and then to the concert. The next morning we will probably grab breakfast somewhere and then go to Penn Station to head home.    Any preference as to either of these hotels?    Thank you all in advance for your feedback. ,BeachTravel1219,New York City,
We're driving from Niagara Falls to Canandaigua in a rental car. Google shows fastest route (by a half hour only) has tolls. I don't mind a more scenic route but will it just be slower and not scenic? Last rental wanted quite a bit for toll access. Any advice on this. Very hard to get a live person to ask on the phone! ,chewpei,Finger Lakes,"Downers Grove, IL"
We are planning a weekend trip in mid-Oct. with our adult kids and their spouses. We hope to go to the Corning Museum Watkins Glen Park wineries/breweries restaurants and any other suggestions people offer. It seems that people suggest not staying in Watkins Glen. We are looking at Airbnb and would like a convenient location. Would Corning be a good location for our base? I am afraid Ithaca would be hectic with college students.    Thanks for the help! ,udpt82,Finger Lakes,New York
7/15/23 (Day 1)    Flew from Los Angeles to JFK arriving roughly on time at 7:55pm. This was my 2nd visit to NYC (first back in 2005) and 1st visit for my wife. We‚Äôre both active seniors in our mid-60s.  Using advice from T/A got in the proper taxi line to get fixed rate to Manhattan- no issues. $100 with fee/tolls/tip.    Arrived about 9:30pm to check-in to the RIU Plaza Manhattan Times Square. Hotel was very nice with easy check-in. Informed that not very many restaurants were still open so opted to eat/drink right across the street at Long Acre Tavern. Food/drinks/service very good.    7/16/23 (Day 2)    Purposely planned for late start due to time difference. Had 1:00pm tickets for Taylor Swift Exhibit at Museum of Arts & Design and got a bit rained on in the walk to the museum. Exhibit was for me just OK but wife enjoyed it more. It was pretty cool that they kept showing Taylor‚Äôs videos on screen where she is wearing many of the outfits on display. The rest of the museum was only somewhat interesting. We did do a light lunch at Robert‚Äôs restaurant above the museum that had very nice views of Columbus Circle and some of Central Park. Food/service was excellent.    3:00 went on the Iconic Views of Central Park Tour with a Central Park Conservatory guide. I can‚Äôt say it was too exciting Geared towards a lot of the trees birds etc.  Headed to Pier 83 for the Circle Line Harbor Lights Cruise and stopped on the way there at Gotham West Market and had some really good white pizza (our favorite kind).    7:00pm- Very informational Circle Line Harbor Lights Cruise seeing many of the sights around Manhattan and getting fairly close to Statue of Liberty. Highly recommended. The tour person was somewhat of a comedienne but not always very funny. At this time of year we really didn‚Äôt get to see much of Manhattan lit up in the dark. Tour ended at 9:00pm. Walked back to hotel.    7/17/23 (Day 3)    Did the 6-hr NYC Bus and Boat Tour (9:30am-3:30pm) and thought this was the highlight of the trip because it covered so many of our must see sites such as Times Square start of Brooklyn Bridge 911 Memorial and the World Trade Center area Grand Central Terminal as well as taking the Staten Island Ferry past the Statue of Liberty. Very informative guides and ensured that you had several restroom breaks and a lunch break!    Walked to Rockefeller Center thinking we would book tickets for Top of the Rock for the next day but since there was absolutely no line we decided to go right up. It was a bit hazy but the view was still good. I‚Äôd have to say that since I went to the top of the Empire State Building on my first trip to NYC that this was not as impressive as that was. There‚Äôs so many taller buildings now that you just don‚Äôt get the feeling you‚Äôre looking down at everything else.    Ate outside that night at McCarthy‚Äôs Bar just a block over from the hotel and the service was amazing and I had the most lean corned beef sandwich that I think I‚Äôve ever had! We ate here a few times on our trip and the people were amazing and the prices were very reasonable.    7/18/23 (Day 4)    Very rainy in the morning so we stayed in the room until a late brunch at about 1:30pm across the street at Long Acre Tavern. While we ate there was some excitement about what was going on at the new hotel next door and the secret word was a pop-up concert by Post Malone to christen the new hotel‚Äôs balcony stage overlooking Times Square and the release of his new album ‚ÄúAustin‚Äù (his real name is Austin Richard Post). We were told it was supposed to start at 3:00pm so we went out there at about 2:45pm but it wasn‚Äôt until about 5:45pm that he actually came out and performed. We were right there front row on 7th Ave. and 47th St. behind the police barricade to see it all. He was really awesome and seems like such a humble guy and was thrilled to be the very first to play at this new Times Square venue. He played about 5-6 songs. We were really starting to sweat out the delay as to when when he‚Äôd start playing because we had 7:00pm tickets for Funny Girl.    7:00pm- in my humble opinion Lea Michelle totally owned Funny Girl! Her vocals were absolutely incredible and I was surprised at how good her comedic talent was. I thought that if she wasn‚Äôt on stage or singing that the show was a bit boring. She‚Äôs truly phenomenal!    7/19/23 (Day 5)    In the morning we Uber‚Äôd to DUMBO and ate at the Time Out Market. We had excellent ramen at Mr Taka Ramen.    From DUMBO walked across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan. Visited the Oculus and also walked again around the 911 Memorial. We had dinner plans later that evening with my nephew who lives in NYC so to kill time went to the Loopy Doopy Rooftop Bar. We left very quickly because it was very small and extremely noisy and crowded. So walked around Rockefeller Park on the Hudson River which was very nice and peaceful.    We met my nephew and his daughter at PJ Clarke‚Äôs on the Hudson for dinner. Dinner was very good but there were some serious issues with the bill. The bill seemed high so I looked it over carefully and some items seemed to have been charged twice. It ended up being about a $120 overcharge on about a $200 bill. They did fix it but the explanation really didn‚Äôt make sense. Uber‚Äôd back to hotel.    7/20/23 (Day 6)    Walked from the hotel to the northern start of the High Line (some of it was being refurbished so didn‚Äôt get on until 30th Street). Overall I thought the High Line a bit disappointing. It was beautifully landscaped but very crowded even on a weekday and I thought there would be much better views especially of the Hudson River which was rarely seen.    We stopped during the High Line to have lunch at Chelsea Market. Very cool place but also very crowded for a weekday. Seating was very limited. We ate at the Lobster Place and had a Lobster Roll and a Salmon Bowl and the Salmon took forever! Based on what we saw others eating we should have ordered the Lobster Bake.    After getting off the High Line we walked around Greenwich Village in the parts that were advised by TA but we were surprised at all of the scaffolding everywhere!    That night we had dinner at Gayle‚Äôs Broadway Rose (in Friedman‚Äôs Edison Hotel). The food and service were good and the singers were pretty awesome singing Broadway hits but the venue left a lot to be desired. It was kind of dark and there were these huge posts that made it difficult to see who was singing.    7/21/23 (Day 7)    Arranged with the hotel to have a driver pick us up to return to JFK. When making arrangements the price was $90 including tolls. Halfway to the airport the driver tried to tell us it was $90 plus $20 dollars for tolls. We told her we had paperwork that said otherwise and she let it go. She did stop for gas on the way to the airport which we thought pretty unprofessional. Don‚Äôt know the name of the service since it was arranged by the RIU Hotel.    Got to JFK in plenty of time and flight back to LAX was uneventful.    Overall we both thoroughly enjoyed our week in NYC and never felt unsafe even when walking at night. We did  however avoid the train and mostly walked with a few Uber rides. ,JimmyMac,New York City,Long Beach...
Hello    Travelling to New York in Nocember for 4 days and looking at city passes. Any of them more recommended than others?

Greetings:    Concierge at William Vale suggested taxi during a non prime time hour (Sunday either 12:30 or 2:30PM) will run between $100 - $150.    That can‚Äôt be right can it?    If so and if I fly into JFK I will take a combo AirTrain/LIRR to Flatbush/taxi instead. ,El Chevere,New York City,"Miami, Florida"

I witnessed 2 of the classics on my walk from Grand Central to Port Authority this morning. Scam #1 the cartoon character family photo. Now this one I think is more of a victimless scam. They took a photo of their kids with Elmo and his friends dad reached into his pocket pulled out some cash and paid them. It looked like an arranged transaction and really none of my business  Scam #2 the phony Munk and the bracelet. I saw the whole thing. The timid approach slipping bracelets on both ladies wrist obvious tourists and then the request for money. They both looking somewhat caught off guard reached into their purses and got cash to give him. I was torn I wanted to tell them he was fake and by no means did they have to give him money but i just kept walking. What's the ethical thing to do? I mean the smallest amount of pre trip research you'd know they are scamming people. Is it buyer beware? Survival of the fittest? Do any of you try to help? I'm really not sure what is the right thing to do ,DK,New York City,Connecticut
Has anyone done these two cities in the same day via train from NY?  We want to do a day trip while we‚Äôre there I want to see the White House and the Lincoln Memorial my other half wants to see the Rocky Steps and have a cheesesteak from Philly. As a compromise I wondered if we could squeeze both into the same day with some meticulous planning.  I‚Äôve done a dummy booking with Amtrak and if I utilise our jet lag by getting the extra early train on our first day around 5am I‚Äôm thinking we could do NYC-Washington see those sights leave Washington around 1-2pm get to Philly around 3pm see the Rocky Steps hopefully liberty bell and eastern penitentiary. Then grab a cheesesteak and get the train back around 7pm. Am I being too optimistic? I have no idea of the distances between the monuments in the cities and their distance from the train stations. ,Jay Cee,New York City,

My teenage son and I will be in NYC next Saturday. We‚Äôre staying at my partner‚Äôs parents house outside of Philly and renting a car for this trip. I‚Äôve only been to NYC once many years ago for a concert so I‚Äôm a newbie for sure. I know what we want to do and I got a map and plotted all the spots out but I‚Äôm still debating on the order of things (plus I don‚Äôt know how long it will take to get from one place to another and my experience with traveling is always expect things to take longer than they are supposed to!). We plan to walk and take the subway. Here is my general plan looking for suggestions on order of things things I‚Äôm missing or should see etc.    Saturday: Drive from Philly to New Jersey Penn Station take train to NYC Penn Station. Planning on getting to the city by 10:30am.    Take subway to South Ferry and take Staten Island Ferry. Grab lunch after.    2pm: 1 hour pedicab tour of Central Park (worried that we might not make it in time?)    Check into hotel in mid-town and relax.    Dinner/walk thru Times Square/Hamilton at 8pm    Sunday: Summit One at 9am (thinking the earliest spot will mean shoter wait times?)    Lunch and visit to A La Mode Ice Cream at 55th and 1st Ave (this is a must as it‚Äôs nut free and my son has a nut allergy and has never had ice cream at an ice cream shop)    1pm possible tour of Financial District (tour is not available Saturdays) or visit American Museum of Natural History    Train back to NJ and drive home late afternoon/evening    I could flip things and arrive on Saturday do Summit One at maybe 11:30 lunch/ice cream shop pedicab at 3 back to hotel by 4:45 to get ready for the evening. Right now the weather looks better on Sunday and I was thinking the early slot would mean less wait time but maybe it would be better to do the ferry and financial district together on Sunday...?    Another question I have is if there is an app that will help me navigate the subway (I haven‚Äôt searched this yet so sorry if it‚Äôs already been posted here).    Thanks in advance for your feedback! ,Deena Marie,New York City,"Eureka, California"

Thinking of attending the grand tasting event Oct 14 at the NY Food & Wine festival. I have read a few older posts from previous years but interested in more recent experiences from anyone that has attended. Wondering: 1) Culinary Demonstrations: Are there chairs provided ? It would be hard to take notes standing. (We are not doing the separate ticketed events- just the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù ones as part of grand tasting event admission ticket.) How long before demo should we arrive? 2) Food / wine lines/ quantity: How many food samples are we likely to get in 5 hour period? Do you spend all your time in a line & maybe get less or more than 5 food samples total? 3) Cookbooks on site: Entry info infers cookbook included. Is there a separate $ for this? Do organizers pick cookbook? is this given at culinary demo or do you pick up somewhere else? Is there a table to purchase cookbooks? Any info would be greatly appreciated! ,Snorkelgirl333,New York City,"Edmonton, Canada"

Hi    Kindly help me out on choosing between this two hotels planning to travel during second week of December for 8 days in 2023. Already done a booking but not sure which one to choose.

Hello  I have a family of 4. One of my daughters is under the 44 inches.  I will be in NYC from Wednesday to Wednesday.  I am planning to buy one metro card and load my money onto it.  How does the taping work I tap once and walk in with my under 44 inch daughter then tap again for second daughter then tap for wife? Same with exit?  I have also considered the 7 day unlimited card do I buy 3 separate cards or is that all on one card?  I am assuming if I get the 7 day unlimited its starts the first day I tap does it go by 7 days or a full 168 hours?  Thanks! ,barqs,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"

Hi remember me? We are thinking about doing Letchworth State Park sometime this summer. We'll probably have just 2 nights so I'm thinking possibly base in Corning to break the drive devote a full day on our full day and have some decent food options around like Hand + Foot. I understand its not super close. Should I make an effort to stay closer or this is a good plan? Is there anything interesting to do in/near corning besides the glass museum (already been but many moons ago). ,ziggy60,Finger Lakes,"New York City, New..."
We street parked on Main Street to get breakfast at Main Street Bistro (fabulous food). We paid for 1 hour at the meter.    I set an alarm for 50 minutes later to remind me to add money to the meter. I returned to the car a bit earlier than that to add money. I still had 12 minutes left but put in coins to add another hour.    When we got back to our car we found a parking ticket. It was written for the time right before I returned to the car the first time! After speaking with some people in town we hear that the company that writes the tickets has a reputation for erroneous parking tickets. They took one look and once they saw we were from NYC knew we weren't going to drive back up there for a hearing. $20 easy bucks into the town pockets.    I protested the ticket in writing and received a response that if I want to protest it and plead NOT GUILTY I have to go back to New Paltz and appear in court. It's not worth my time to spend 4 hours round trip to go up there. I'll pay the $20. I suggest you avoid parking along main street.    Too bad for the Main Street businesses. My mind is made up not to go back there. There are plenty of other small tourist friendly towns. ,tmshack,New Paltz,"Atlanta, Georgia"

Hello  My wife and I are retirees making our annual visit to New York City in Sept. We stay in the Ground Zero vicinity where I lived for a long time including on 9/11/2001.  We like ot walk around the financial district up along the Hudson River walkway and around midtown/Central Park.  When I lived there I'd often have to walk through a marijuana cloud especially during lunch hour in the financial district and that was before the semi-legalization of weed. With the influx of more immigrants than the city was prepared to handle and the proliferation of homeless people nationwide are the sidewalks still walkable?

Confused about hotel location. Based on research location price it seems like better options to stay from around 37th Avenue to Midtown versus the other direction from Midtown to around 57th or so. Any thoughts on which area/direction is preferable as far as being close to restaurants events and safety? I know this is a broad question but any input in very much appreciated.

Hello  I am debating a sun stroller to NYC. My kids don't use strollers anymore I sometimes bring a wagon places and load them in but its too big for this trip.  I have a small sun stroller that folds easily and is fairly light. It could probably fit under most restaurant tables if folded.  What obstacles will I face when going to say a restaurant or the Empire state building or museums. Will I be told to leave it outside?  Thanks! ,barqs,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"
I will be travelling to NYC by car in a few weeks. I am thinking of parking at a ferry terminal and taking the ferry across to NYC and then public transportation to my hotel near Times Square.  1) Is this a good option for safe parking and an easy way to get to Times Square?  2) would it be better to drive my car into NYC and find a parking garage there ( I am feeling nervous about driving in the city)  3) is there a better or easier option for parking my car in a safe spot and getting to the city?    Thanks so much in advance for any help you can give me.  Pamela ,Pamela P,New York City,"Gaspe, Canada"

Hi    I'm looking for some restaurant recommendations that are nicer that offer a kids menu too. When we last visited (2018) we ate at Landmarc which was perfect a nice/smart casual dining but with a kids menu too.

I‚Äôm so excited to be visiting in October with my family. I grew up in RI and we would visit the city often. Now I live in Florida and haven‚Äôt been in 20+ years. We will be visiting family in RI and taking the train into NY before flying out. We only have 2 short days there. My husband and kids have never been. My husband doesn‚Äôt want to stay in Times Square area. He has his heart set on the Wall Street area because of what we want to do with the limited time we will be there. I do have a few questions about this area.  1. Overall Safety?  2. Does it shut down at night since it is more of a financial district? Will there be plenty of options food wise?  3. We are looking at the Hilton Garden Inn on Water street. Good/bad? Lol  4. Can you recommend any hotels that have multiple bedrooms?  5. Also if you have any recommendations in this area I would love them!    Thank you so much for any help. ,Martha S,New York City,
One week to go before I go to NYC. I am nervous. I never been there before. My family all say 'be careful' saying it's worse than London in terms of safety. I am hoping it's just old stereotyping.    I'll be staying at HI NYC hostel. That's in upper west side. Near Colombia university you'd think it's a safe place. But it's near Harlem. I'll be out pretty much all of the day only coming in to quietly buy tickets online for the next day sleep shower etc.    My questions are: how safe is the HI NYC area at night? I am likely to be coming back from my activities around 11pm-12am going out at around 7am.    Has anyone here used HI NYC? If so how big are their lockers? They said in an email to me 'lockers are large enough to fit a medium-sized suitcase and a small backpack or handbag at 36 x 18 x 21 inches'. Can anyone confirm? My luggage case is about the same size as this not exceeding any measure. I have my own padlock.    While I'm out i have a crossbody bag. I am uncomfortable leaving my money at the hostel even if it's in a padlocked locker. I'll be carrying my card iPhone and water bottle with me. They say don't want with uncertainty consulting maps as thieves are experienced enough to spot the naive and helpless and I'm travelling alone not exactly strong and hope being around other people will keep me safe. I never keep my wallet in my back pocket. My pockets don't have zips though! ,carljohnson,New York City,"Kent, England"
My family of 5 (husband and 3 teenagers) will be visiting New York City for the first time in June of 2024. We are flying in to LGA on June 1st and will land at 1:45pm. We're leaving Thursday June 6th for a NY road trip to Niagara Falls. So we have a little over 4 full days. I've already spent hours narrowing down what sites to see based on my kids and husband's interests. Having said that I'm not sure if this is still doable. We're also trying to keep costs on the lower side if possible. We'll be staying in Midtown South area. Our hotel provide free breakfast every morning so we'll eat at the hotel before venturing out each day. We'll be walking and using busses and subway.    Can anyone tell me if this is doable? Any suggestions on what to do each day?    Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Tour (5 hours)  9/11 Memorial Only  Trinity Church & Cemetery  Wicked Broadway  Times Square  Bike Rental Central Park (2 hours)  The Met  Top of the Rock & Rockefeller Center & Plaza  FAO Schwarz  Walk Brooklyn Bridge / Brooklyn Heights / Dumbo  High Line  Hamilton Grange Estate  Washington Square Park  Chinatown  Spend a short time in NJ to see the waterfront Weehauken Dueling Grounds and maybe Empty Sky Memorial      We'd love to at least walk by the building listed below  Empire State Building  Flatiron Building  The Plaza Hotel  Chrysler Building  FDNY Ladder 8  Wall Street Charging Bull & Fearless Girl  St. Patrick's Cathedral ,jillindajaneway,New York City,"Fort Worth, Texas"
List of things I want to do: the Summit TOTR Statue Liberty cruise a play Circle Line cruise Bronx Zoo UN tour the Met and Natural History museums 9/11 museum and One World.  I been looking at these sites for many weeks and notice some are fully booked days in advance like the Summit others I notice tickets still available on the day/hour like the 9/11 museum.  Is it still advisable to book well in advance? The thing is I want to leave clear days for the observation decks but I don't have the weather forecast for those days yet which impacts when to book the indoor ones. ,carljohnson,New York City,"Kent, England"
We're interested in attending the Vance Joy concert at the end of August. I see you can gain access to the VIP sections with a membership. Is it worth it? What is the price of concert tickets on top of membership can't tell on their website. Also if I just buy general admission in the stands do I have to arrive really early to secure seats? I have seen a video showing a long line up to gain entry... doesn't look very fun especially given the tickets aren't inexpensive. Any feedback on this concert series would be appreciated. ,BrPCA,New York City,"Calgary, AB"
Hello I wanted to find out which option is better. My friends and I want to visit New York but we are on a tight budget the main two options where to stay are Central Harlem or Staten Island near the ferry but Staten Island is cheaper to live in and I was wondering if the time to get to the financial district from both places is similar. does it make sense to stay in staten island? Or Queens is better? ,Gus R,New York City,
Hi    We are a family of 4 with 2 kids (ages 7 and 13) planning to fly in between Aug9-14 from Texas. We are not planning to do anything on the days when we are flying. This will be our first trip to the big apple. I would appreciate your suggestions on activities for kids sequence/ combination of activities/places to visit on a given day combo ticket/passes for activities food recommendations and places to stay.    Food preference ( No red meat): We tend to stay away from anything beyond $$ (~20 per person) but would like to try a couple of $$$ ( ~40-50 per person) while we are there.  Stay: Planning to stay at Westin/times square for all 4 nights and use a combination of subway/Uber/Taxi for the commute. I would like to consider other places as long as we can commute easily (preferably by subway) is safe and have a decent view (my wife likes water views).    Activity list:  - Times Square  - Central Park  - Broadway shows  - Empire state building  - Statue of Liberty  - Wall Street    Thank you. ,Texan Travels,New York City,

I'm treating my 30-something daughter to a mid-October weekend in NY -- it's an escape for her (from 2 little kids) so want to make it special. Sounds easy enough but younger son is in school at Columbia so that brings us to the Upper West Side for easy access to him. We will want to see his world but will also want to visit MOMA see a Broadway show (haven't decided which one but want a fun musical) and walk through Central Park (hopefully fall foliage). And find some interesting restaurants as we are all foodies. Interesting bakeries coffee shops small eateries markets all a big plus. We live in major cities so don't need the bustle of Times Square (at all)... we love to walk.  Dilemma is that I wanted to make the hotel somewhat luxurious as a special treat and the ones I'm finding on the UWS do not look exactly that (but are still $600 a night for 2 beds which we want). Have found Hotel Beacon which does have a big suite but is described as apartment-style so not exactly posh. Hotel Lucerne is slightly more expensive but doesn't sound particularly luxurious either.  We've heard that West Village might be a good place but not sure. Any thoughts given our plans? ,DianeTN,New York City,Nashille
I know that on the subway map block dots are local trains. White dots are express trains. Express trains only stop at white dots. Local trains stop at both black and white stops.    But when I'm at the station how can I tell that the train I step in is a local train or an express train?  I suppose if the station on the map is a black dot then it's a local train but what if I'm at a white dot station?    Would it say 'express' or 'local' on the front or sides of the train? ,carljohnson,New York City,"Kent, England"

What is your favorite song about NYC?    I ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City
I'm (36) spending 2 weeks in New Jersey with my mom (71).    We will be staying at our cousin's in Jersey City. I've done this twice before and also have traveled elsewhere several times alone but this is the first time I'm traveling with my mom (actually we did stay at this same place and visited NYC when I was like 10 so that doesn't count). I mention this because I'm fairly confident in traveling alone but this time I feel I need to take care of my mother.    We plan on stating in Jersey City taking the Path to Manhattan and move by Subway and hop on - hop off buses.    She has good physical condition can walk long distances and has a good attitude. We are both art lovers (both went to Art School) so I'm really looking forward to going to the Met Guggenheim Neue Galerie Museo del Barrio etc. I've seen these but my mom hasn't and I'm sure she will love those.    Our budget is not too tight but we tend to be frugal if we can in some things. (For example I'd eat something quick for lunch if the plan is to have a nice dinner)    So here are my questions:    1. What would be some suggestions for activities to attend to and where? She doesn't speak english and as far as I've seen the musicals are usually in said language so perhaps something more of a dance show would be nice.    2. Is there any small jazz club that you would recommend? I'm the one who's more into jazz so I would not like to spend a lot in case she's not enjoying much. (jazz is like that sometimes it gets weird haha)    2. Of the multipasses available is there any recommendation in particular?    3. How easy is it to get an Uber in Jersey to take us to the Path station?    Thanks in advance. Pueden responder en espa√±ol tambi√©n jaja ,Sol C,New York City,"San Jose, Costa Rica"
I am looking for a tour guide for us. A family of 4.5.  This is our first time to new york and we would like to see the major attractions like whatever we can cover in one days tour. Usually how much would it cost. Thanks. ,Robin S,,"Ar Rumays, Oman"
Hello  This is my 7 day itinerary for a family of 4 with a 7 and 4 year old.  We will be staying at Arlo Midtown located at 38th and 9th.  We arrive 11am Wednesday 2nd and leave noon Wednesday the 9th.  At 11am on a Wednesday will traffic make taking the bus subway worth it from LaGuardia? I have researched that a taxi will cost $60 ($60 sounds cheap is this price outdated)? I assume the taxi would be a lot faster?  We have the New York city pass with 4 free activities.  I am open to restaurant suggestions I haven't researched it a lot because our kids are picky will only pizza chicken fingers noodles mac and cheese simple pasta sometimes hamburgers.  I am also flexible to switch days of activities if it makes sense.    Wednesday  Highline walk  Anything to do on the way to Yankee Stadium or close by?  Yankees game    Thursday  Lunch at Gallaghers  Central park  Central park zoo  Victory Theater 7pm show    Friday  Empire state building (using pass) i have debated best time to see this sunset would be great but do to busyness ai think i will opt for morning I heard its not busy then  (Have time to add something here)  Public library  Friday night bryant park free concert    Saturday  Sky Scraper museum kids art event in battery park 10:30 -11:30  I see skyscraper museum and kids play in battery park or maybe they join in museum  Brooklyn bridge  kids explore Dumbo parks  Eat at Timeout Market    Sunday  Intrepid museum (using pass)  Circle Line Manhattan cruise (using pass) I have considered just using free Staten island ferry and saving this pass activity for something else    Monday  Cooney island  Aquarium  Luna Amusement Park (using pass)    Tuesday  Currently somewhat blank as a make up day for rain ect open to suggestions.  Some possibly indoor ideas if rains  Disney camp Encanto exhibit  Suggestions for the best museum for kids?  I love the free walking tours I doubt my kids would but the graffiti Bushwick tour might interest them?    Any opinions welcome and appreciated.  Thanks! ,barqs,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"
Coming to NYC for my 59th bday with 2 of my best girlfriends (47 & 55). No physical restrictions for any of us. This is their first trip and my 4th but it's been awhile for me. I would appreciate some feedback on my itinerary below. They are not interested in any other museums besides the one's listed. We would love any thoughts or ideas for the best use of our time. We will be using the subway for sure to scoot around easier.    We are interested in a pedicab tour of Central Park. Thought or suggestions please?    I would also like opinions on what the best transfer is from the LaGuardia airport. I've seen other posts but not sure they are recent. Quick and reasonable ideas please.    For Hamilton most posts suggest definitely buying ahead since they sell out and discounts are not available.    We would appreciate any budget friendly ideas but not an absolute.    Thank you ahead of time for any help....much appreciated.      NYC daft schedule:    Day 1: (arrive at airport at 1.00pm- Head to hotel on W. 55th st - Drop off bag)  ?? Not sure what to do with this partial day since flight arrivals can vary if delayed. Don‚Äôt want reserved tickets anywhere and not be able to do it if we're late.    Day 2:  Staten Island Ferry (not touring..just going out to see it)  * 9-11 Memorial / Museum/ One World Tower  * Walk part way over Brooklyn Bridge  *Trinity Church  * Greenwich Village  * Chelsea Market    Day 3:  *Today Show/Rockefeller Center  *Tenement Museum  * Chinatown  * Little Italy  Hotel to change  Dinner (maybe this place‚Ä¶*Lillies Victorian Establishment)  Hamilton  Time Square    Day 4 (no certain order ? this day)  * Central Park Pedicab tour  *Grand Central Terminal audio tour  *5th Avenue Shopping  * Radio City Music Hall  ?? Go to some things we might have seen we didn‚Äôt have time for.    Day 5 : Early flight home ,Melody T,New York City,"Pueblo, Colorado..."
Hi - going to a wedding in a few months at the Mansion. Which airport is best to fly into? Looks like Islip is the most cost-effective but if we end the trip in NYC i don't know how we'd get back so far out on the island. What are bridal parties thinking these days with destinations?! ,libbitta,Glen Cove,"Atlanta, Georgia"
We're considering a reservation at this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary and would value your opinions please.  And also can you recommend a great rooftop bar close by for pre-dinner beers/cocktails - with outside seating and maybe a decent view ,G Singh,New York City,West Midlands...
Good morning -  I‚Äôve read on the forums that most restaurants especially higher end do not have a children‚Äôs menu..but most will make cacio e Pepe etc. I‚Äôm  traveling with my daughter this fall and would like to make a couple of nicer reservations.  Could you tell me if the above is correct and also would she be able to order something like ‚Äúscrambled eggs‚Äù at Boucherie for brunch? How common is modifying a menu for younger palates?  We would appreciate any recommendations for a nice brunch where she could have a more traditional breakfast.  Thank you! ,HolidayE,New York City,North Carolina
Hi! Which of the 3 months would you visit? 2 adults and a 2 yr old.. I'm thinking October would be pretty with the foliage...maybe Nov too and less crowded and expensive or Dec when it's decorated for Christmas?  We would like to walk the shops do a short easy hike and not sure what else. Also is 3 nights a good length? We are about 4hrs away driving. ,jmd2122,Saratoga Springs,"Marlton, New Jersey"
I am thinking of doing a hamptons trip over Labor Day weekend. Can stay for 4 nights. I am 37 and going solo. Like charming towns beaches good restaurants and nightlife (prefer live music bars). I found 2 airbnbs. One looks to be about 7 minute drive north of the town of east hampton. Other Airbnb is in sag harbor and says 5 min walk to beach 15 min drive to Southampton and 15 min drive to town of sag harbor. That one is a bit cheaper and completely adorable little cottage with hot tub and patio. Other one looks nice too and would be close to montauk to check out as well.    Which do you think would make more sense ? Should I split the weekend between the two? ,Carly H,Hamptons,Philadelphia...
I‚Äôm moving into an apartment in Manhattan and will arrive late in the evening with a loaded car. Is there a recommendation for a safe place to park until I can get into my apartment the next day? I have a friend‚Äôs apartment to stay for the night but no parking. Would prefer to just pay for parking rather than a hotel room and parking. ,Sreed3414,New York City,Winston Salem...
Hi all. We come down quite often and always stay at the Howard Johnson‚Äôs in North Bergen (cheap free parking and breakfast). There is a shuttle which takes us in and picks us back up in the evening but sometimes we would love to go back to the hotel to drop off purchases or just refresh. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a better place to stay where we could grab a subway on the PATH system and we could get back and forth easier. Thanks ,JThompson50,New York City,"Ottawa, Canada"

Hi everyone.    I've been back from NYC for almost a week but every time I started writing up my notes I got interrupted. So here follow my adventures broken out by day. Watch this space for updates...    I got a lot of mileage out of this trip be warned. And as a former educator I love to do offbeat unusual things.    Day 1    Had an overnight flight into EWR (I am an Alaska mileage plan flyer). The predawn eastern light out the window was beautiful but as things got brighter I could see a layer of smoke clouds (being from fire country it was unmistakable). Fortunately things cleared up as we approached Newark.    I was on the airport bus into Manhattan soon after arrival and found myself at the Port Authority Bus terminal in a reasonable time. Regarding travel options I don't mind taking the bus as I'm generally not in a hurry and it's easy to buy tickets online in advance (and ü§´ I'm now officially er of a certain age so I get a senior discount!).    Once I arrived I headed downstairs to get a weekly MTA pass (given the amount of use I get out of it it's a bargain) and reloaded my metro card from last trip. Then I went back up to catch the M20 bus to my digs pausing first to get a photo of the Ralph Kramden statue in front of the entrance. I spoke with a security guard at the NY Times building about the smoke problem and he told me things were better finally.    After changing and dropping off my bags I grabbed coffee and a bagel (what else?) then made my way towards Tribeca where I planned to tour the Theodore Roosevelt birthplace. I found the building and told the ranger to put me down for the next tour (free!).    I next had a wander through the Union Square farmer's market and was amazed to see locally made alcoholic beverages for sake next to the produce and flowers. The vendors told me it was permitted and I explained that we don't have that option back home.    The Flatiron Building is still covered up (same as last October) but the nearby dog park was once again filled with friendly canines and their people (I long ago learned the way to a New Yorker's heart is through their dog!). I enjoyed the action for a few minutes then started back to the tour site.    Theodore Roosevelt spent much of his early years living at the Manhattan townhome that is now a museum. It's celebrating its centennial this year. A tour of the beautiful period restored living space is offered by the National Park Service who oversees the property. A small exhibit also contains artifacts and information about the family including a Teddy bear (of course!) Tours do involve climbing stairs do be prepared for that.    As I was leaving the building a promised thunderstorm made a brief appearance. I had no qualms about the weather so I put on my hooded slicker and sloshed up the half flooded street in my trusty Olu Kai flip flops. Oh dear. Then it started hailing but only for a minute and by the time I was back near the new Harry Potter exhibit (didn't go in but it looked nice) the sun was back out.    I had a 5:15 reservation for late lunch at the Tiffany Blue Box Cafe so I hurried to my room to transform from ordinary tourist to Tiffany woman. Got to the store in plenty of time to explore the newly refurbished floors. Everything looked beautiful and I remarked to an associate that when I'd passed by last October the building was still gutted and under construction. What a transformation!    The new cafe is gorgeous. Artfully decorated yet quite simple and elegant. Tiffany blue is the color scheme of course with silver accents. There aren't too many tables which explains why a reservation is such a hot ticket. I saw a wide cross section of patrons plus a lively group at the nearby bar which seats about eight.    Jet lag appetite meant I opted for simple fare I chose the smoked salmon served with sour cream cucumber salad and bagel crisps. The table near me was enjoying Tiffany Tea which looked delectable.    I wished I could have lingered for dessert and a drink but the sun shining through the atrium meant my plans to attend the opening night NY Philharmonic concert in Central Park were not scuppered after all. So I took my leave lingering once more at the display of exquisite wisteria patterned china before going out to get a bus up towards the concert venue. I'd packed a blanket and snacks for the occasion.    This was my first Central Park big concert and I must say it was quite an experience. We have outdoor events at home but nothing like this. The Philharmonic played crowd favorites which this music teacher's daughter loved. And fireworks ended a perfect evening.    As I drifted off to sleep later I knew I'd be in for a busy fun week ahead but it had already started perfectly.    More to follow... ,Kittygal üá∫üá¶ üåª,New York City,Los Angeles...

Just wondering peoples thoughts on new years T apple bees New York OR suggestions on any other places in New York to experience new years    We are a family of four kids 14 and 18 years old ,Olivia S,New York City,
My wife (70) and I (73) have never been to the Adirondacks and are planning a short get away from Cleveland Ohio. 8/1 will be an all day travel. Plan to spend 3 nights in the area and depart for home on the 4th so we will basically have the 2nd and 3rd to see the area. We have no idea where to stay to get a good overview of the area. Our time is flexible and we could add another day to the trip. We basically just want to see the sights. We do like to take short hikes (1-2 miles) on reasonably flat ground. Would prefer to stay in one place. Don't mind taking short road trips to see different areas. Bottom line is we are looking for a good locations to stay hotel suggestions (moderately priced) and a suggested itinerary. Thanks in advance for your suggestions. ,Michael D,Adirondacks,"Mentor, Ohio"

We have decided on this tower to go up on our first day in NYC this month! Is it advised to buy tickets first and should we expect to queue (how long?) once we get there with or without tickets? Is it best to book on their www no discount sites? ,debkan,New York City,
Hi I intend booking tickets for the above but have also booked a table in the Grill and bar. Are the tickets for the observation platform or do you need them to go into the building? The reason I ask is what time do I book the tickets for? Table booked for 2pm so will be later for the lift to the top. ,jazzih63,New York City,West Yorkshire...
My husband was in Chelsea on Saturday and had his wallet removed from his front pant pocket in a crowded subway- he was the last one to board the car.  He became aware of his pocket feeling lighter but in the crush of people hadn't felt anything while it was being removed.  Our NYC relative tried to file a police report online but was unable to do so- an online notice said the report had to be filed in person.  Luckily the fraudulent charges came to under $500. One of the cards in his wallet (credit union) requires a police report for anything over $500.  Also our NYC relative said that the advice in such incidents is as soon as you're aware of it you should announce loudly to other passengers something to the effect- Pickpocket alert. Check your belongings. ,anonj,New York City,USA
Hi all    Need advise.    I will arrive from Boston in the morning at 08.30 on a Flixbus that stops at 127 Old Main Street.  I need to store my luggage at the Bounce located at Niagara Gorge Discovery Center Parking Storage Spot.  Can I use the Discover Niagara Shuttle to go to Bounce?  And which stop should I get off Niagara Gorge Trails and Schoellkopf Elevator or Aquarium of Niagara?    Or is there an alternative place to store my luggage for morning to evening only.  Because I am going to NY at 22.00.    Thanks in advance  Ika ,Ika_Rismayanti,Niagara Falls,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Hello everyone    We are planning to visit Hudson Valley the last 4 days of this October. We will be based in the NY/NJ state line and travel up to Kingston. I would just like to know the peak fall color dates in lower (?) Hudson Valley based on past experience. I did a little research myself and it seems it's getting later and later but the last week of October is what was reported over the last two years. Is this what people have experienced? Thank you. ,Danny_7766,,Washington DC...
Hi    I'm plan to rent a car and drive during my east coast trip. My trip start from JFK airport Boston Buffalo Pittsburgh Washington and back to NYC.    I'm using tollGuru (US toll calculator) to search toll's fee and I'm found that most of the toll is cashless. It is more convenient if I'm using E-zpass to go during my trips? Any pros or cons of E-zpass?    I have limited information because E-zpass's website is denied my access. Maybe I'm from oversea.    Your information is appreciated.

Hi I'm a Canadian I will be going on a road trip in New York State within two weeks from now. I will be using my own car so I cannot rely on pay - after by receiving a bill from a car rental company.    It's been a while since I last visited the US so I was wondering:    Do New York State Highway Toll Booths accept Credit Cards?  (sorry to sound robotic but I'm phrasing it bluntly in hopes this thread shows up on google searches)      I'm trying to plan how much physical cash I'll have to purchase and carry. I've been google searching and looking up this site but all of the results either mention EZ-Pass or pay - by - mail and neither look convenient or applicable for me: I don't want to rent a transponder for EZ-Pass and my car won't be in the NY State DMV mailing system (foreign licence plate).    Thanks for any help. ,JProllz,,"Toronto, Canada"
I just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my questions over the past few months regarding our trip to NYC. We just returned and had a fabulous time. Here's a report of our adventures.  Saturday: We arrived (from Philadelphia via Amtrak) in NYC at Moynihan Train Hall. We got our bearings and made our way to the subway and purchased seven-day passes. We took the subway two stops and walked a couple of blocks to the Belvedere Hotel which turned out to be the perfect hotel and location for us.  Once checked in we walked to Central Park and did a self-guided audio walking tour of the southern portion of the park in a light drizzle. It was fun to see all the locals out playing badminton and beach volleyball and picnicking on a Saturday night. The pedicabs though were a nuisance and seem to be a blight on an otherwise beautiful location. We ventured out into the sheep meadow for a few minutes where there were lots of people picnicking and relaxing but when we turned around to leave the gate had been locked! We went to the next gate which was also locked and finally made it out the third gate just as the guys emptying the trash cans were locking it! Why is there a fence around the meadow and why is it locked fairly early on a Saturday night?! After finishing our audio tour we walked down Fifth Ave. to gawk at the fancy shops before cutting over to our hotel.  Sunday: We woke up to inclement weather but didn‚Äôt let a rainy day dampen our spirits. We made our way down to Chelsea Pier for a Classic Harbor Line architecture cruise that circumnavigated Manhattan. The rainy weather wasn‚Äôt ideal for the cruise but we made the best of it and it is an excellent tour. The rain stopped for a good portion of the cruise but started and stopped frequently.  After the cruise we walked over to the aircraft carrier Intrepid where we spent a few hours visiting the space shuttle submarine and other exhibits.  Before the cruise we had walked a portion of the High Line and enjoyed it so much that we returned after we finished at the Intrepid to walk the remainder of the path. We logged more than ten miles today and our feet let us know it!  Monday: Today saw clear sunny skies and of course it was the day we were scheduled to spend indoors at the American Museum of Natural History wouldn‚Äôt you know it! But I overheard museum employees talking about the previous rainy day and describing it as ‚Äúlike Christmas.‚Äù I guess everyone heads indoors on rainy days. That museum is enormous. I never did get my bearings inside and most of the time I didn‚Äôt even know what floor we were on. They didn‚Äôt give out paper maps and I found the app difficult to use as far as navigating the museum so I resorted to frequently asking the guards for directions. We started at the Hayden Planetarium where we watched Worlds Beyond Earth a fantastic show. We covered most of the Rose Center for Earth and Space and then headed over for the brand new immersive exhibit called Invisible Worlds in the new Gilder wing. I was a little skeptical going in but it was an absolutely stunning experience. We then checked out the new Insectarium also in the Gilder Center ‚Ä¶ our favorite parts were the leaf-cutter ants and the bee exhibit. The newly refurbished gems and minerals hall was nearby so we wandered in. My husband was lamenting the absence of any meteorites in the astronomy hall we had visited earlier in the day but just as we turned a corner voila a whole room of meteorites. Is there anything this museum doesn‚Äôt have? We had to ask for directions to see the iconic blue whale as well as the famous dinosaurs in the entrance lobby (We had entered by a side entrance). We had already been there for about six hours and only scratched the surface I‚Äôm sure but we had reached our museum saturation point so we wandered over to Central Park and finished the self-guided audio walking tour we had started two days earlier. Another fun and successful day!  Tuesday: We took the subway to Battery Park to catch the ferry to Liberty Island. We started the day by climbing to the pedestal catching our breaths and then climbing the 162 steps to the crown for some fabulous views. Well actually it was mostly just to be able to say we did it! The views weren‚Äôt all that great because of the haze ‚Ä¶ maybe from the Canadian fires? Once down we took the audio walking tour around the base and then met up with a ranger for what was supposed to be a history walk and talk. But a thunderstorm was rolling in and he had to quickly cancel the planned walk and instead talked about various SoL topics under an overhang at the museum. It rained pretty hard for about an hour. We ended up eating our sandwiches in line for the ferry because there was no place dry to sit.  Once at Ellis Island the rain stopped but the tour there is all indoors so it didn‚Äôt matter! We joined a great program by ranger who revealed at the end that the story he was telling about two immigrants was about his own ancestors. He did a great job of weaving all the factual tidbits into his personal story. We used the audio tour afterwards and realized just how much info the ranger had packed into his presentation.  We started at Liberty Island at 9 am and ended up back at Battery Park around 5pm ‚Ä¶ a very full day! We then took a self-guided audio walking tour of Battery Park. Once back in midtown we decided to get the quintessential NY pastrami sandwich with coleslaw a slice of strawberry cheesecake and a slice of brownie cheesecake at Junior‚Äôs. Mmmmmm. Very yummy.  Wednesday: We tried a new form of transportation this morning ‚Ä¶ a crosstown bus. Other than just missing it and having to wait awhile for the next one we were successful in getting to the United Nations on time for our 9:30 a.m. tour. We enjoyed the tour learning all about the operations of the U.N. and their good work and peacekeeping efforts around the world. We found the gift shop to be unique with special handcrafts from each member nation. We picked out a decorative metallic lizard from Haiti.  After leaving the U.N. we embarked on another self-guided walking tour this time of midtown Manhattan. We started at the Chrysler Building where we were allowed to enter the lobby but the security guards acted like they really didn‚Äôt want us there ‚Ä¶ very odd attitude. It started to rain but we continued on to Grand Central Terminal and then the NY Public Library where I was determined to see Winnie the Pooh and friends. We stumbled upon a docent tour of the Treasures exhibit so we took advantage of seeing the rest of the exhibit as well. After paying respects to Pooh I found a very nice Pooh and friends ornament in the gift shop to add to my Christmas ornament collection. (I try to find a special ornament on each trip I take.)  We then found some lunch in a corner store (would this be called a bodega?) and ate in Bryant Park. We continued our walking tour down to the Empire State Building (I was very underwhelmed) and then over to St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral and Rockefeller Center before heading back to the hotel to freshen up for our Broadway show in the evening.  I know The Lion King doesn't get much love on this forum but we chose it for very specific reasons having to do with my husband's impaired vision so no judgement please! (A lot of thought and research of various shows went into this decision.) We enjoyed every minute of it so it was the perfect choice for us. After the show we had to walk through Times Square ‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt even tell it was night with all the bright lights but it was way too crowded for our taste. We enjoyed seeing the New Year‚Äôs Eve crystal ball with its color-changing patterns ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt realize it is there all year. Then we made a pilgrimage to the Ed Sullivan Theater where we didn‚Äôt get to see a taping of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (much to my husband's chagrin) because of the ongoing writer‚Äôs strike.  Thursday: Today was our Financial District day. We started at the 911 Museum where we spent about three hours. We could have easily spent another couple of hours if we had time to read all the personal stories. We used the museum‚Äôs app purchased for $10 which was excellent.  We left the museum around 1 pm and headed over to Zuccotti Park to get lunch from the much heralded Sam‚Äôs Falafel Cart. (Thanks for that recommendation ... my husband proclaimed it his favorite meal in NYC!) After that we went to the One World Observatory and especially enjoyed the elevator ride up and down! The day was sunny but a bit hazy so not the picture perfect views one hopes for.  We then embarked on a self-guided audio walking tour but kind of skipped around due to the timing. I wanted to get to Federal Hall before it closed and almost couldn‚Äôt find it due to all the scaffolding! We finally found the back entrance. We also enjoyed seeing St. Paul‚Äôs Chapel and Trinity Church. Once we made it back to the World Trade Center we finished our day by using the 911 Memorial walking tour app ($8 also produced by the 911 museum). It was excellent as well and a good way to tour the memorial.  Friday: Time to leave NYC. I was proud of myself for booking a rental car just around the corner from the hotel but after dragging our luggage over there I saw a sign saying it was closed and we had to go to another office a half mile away. We weren‚Äôt looking forward to dragging the bags another half mile or taking the subway so we called a Lyft. Really annoying after all my careful planning.  Our plan was to take a picnic lunch to Bear Mountain State Park and then head to West Point for a tour. Change of plan number two was discovering that the entire state park was closed due to storm damage. We weren‚Äôt expecting that (I hadn't caught the news about that storm since I think it happened after we had left on our trip). We also had to take a detour to West Point as the road past the state park was closed. Thank goodness for Waze.  Mishap number three happened on our way to West Point when some warning lights appeared on the dashboard of the rental car. We pulled over and tried to trouble shoot with the owners manual with no luck. We called roadside assistance who said they would swap cars but turns out they didn‚Äôt have any cars in the vicinity. After doing some googling we decide it was safe to proceed on to West Point where we were in time for the tour. Afterwards we continued to Hyde Park where we stayed for two nights.  Saturday: We finally woke up to a beautiful day with no rain or thunderstorms! We started out with a tour of FDR‚Äôs house at 9:30 a.m. which was packed with info about his life in Hyde Park. We also saw the stables and gardens where FDR and Eleanor are buried. His dog Fala is buried nearby.  We then made our way over to the Vanderbilt mansion for a tour. While waiting for the tour to begin we had time to wander through the formal gardens. Workers were refurbishing the pool there. The ranger leading the tour did a fabulous job and we enjoyed seeing the interior and learning about the Vanderbilts who were considered ‚Äúnew money.‚Äù  After some lunch we headed over to Val Kill Eleanor Roosevelt‚Äôs ‚Äúcottage‚Äù where she worked on many of her activist projects and ran a furniture manufacturing business for a few years. We learned a lot about her that we didn‚Äôt know.  We finally made it back to the FDR National Historic Site in time to visit the FDR Library and Museum which had many fascinating exhibits including recordings of some of his Fireside Chats. His actual office in the library was intact and on display as he was the only president who worked in his own presidential library since it was established before his death while he was still president. An excellent day all around!  Sunday: We left early to drive to JFK for a flight to Toronto. It was a bit nerve wracking for me to drive through Manhattan and Queens (and I'm used to LA driving) but we ended up at JFK unscathed and turned in the problem rental car. We spent a couple of days visiting relatives near Toronto and took a quick drive down to see Niagara Falls.  We enjoyed every day of our trip and consider it a fantastic success! Thanks for all your help both directly and indirectly (through all the countless posts by other people that I read for useful information). ,AB4415,New York City,Los Angeles...
Hi Everyone    I am planning a family vacation and I was curious to know if anyone knows when has foliage peaked the last several years. We plan on going in October and we would love to be there with the changing of the leaves. Not sure if the first 2 weeks of October might be to early  so if anyone is aware of the trends the last several years that would be helpful    Thank you! ,ClosNica1336,Finger Lakes,"Miami, Florida"
Looks like we will be encountering a rainy day in Lake Placid. Anything to do for little ones?  Thank you. ,Anne T,Lake Placid,
Mrs. Natural‚Äôs oldest son lives in the West Village and was out of town & needing kitty-sitters for a weekend July 6-9th. We were happily available and love that we can fly direct from hometown to Newark. Taxi stand in front of the airport 10am to the W.Vill. is $80. plus tip(ouch). Inside their large apartment that‚Äôs only 2 blocks from the Hudson River park to freshen up and say hi to Sesame & Poppy. They said to tell you guys hey.  THURS ‚Äì Breakfast at our fave place Salt‚Äôs Cure(Morton at 7th). Darling wife had oatmeal pancakes & snotty scrambled eggs me an egg & local sausage sandwich split the fried potatoes and a couple of drip coffees(@60. after tip) Completely stuffed went back to the apartment to change into as little clothing as we could manage as it‚Äôs now 92f degrees ! Walked to Chelsea Market which was packed full of tourists and teenagers. It‚Äôs really just a claustrophobic food hall w/crappy trinket and t shirt shops. Quickly out of there to climb several flights of stairs to the High Line & walk to Hudson Yards. Reminder that it‚Äôs literally 92 degrees and we are toast by the time we get there. We find Hudson Yards a shopping mall w/exorbitantly over-priced bars next to the Van Cleef & Arpels and the Bugari stores. Gotta get out of there. We walk on the SHADY side of 9th ave. back thru Chelsea while we just want a glass of wine and a chair. Stopped at Milk & Hops @20th St and was tempted by the groovy micro-brews on offer but they had Sauvignon Blanc on happy hour and it was fresh and for us just in time(x2@17.) Looked at the Apple store but it‚Äôs the just the same as anywhere else . . . and I think Chelsea is so different from what I remember from the last time I had visited(the previous century). Starbucks Equinox Loro Piana the Lucid luxury electric car store SJP Hermes etc. We go back to the kitties & crash for a couple of hours as we got up for the airport at 4:15a and have an 8:30p dinner reservation. Walk to RH Rooftop & it checks ALL of my boxes for a big night out. Sexy rooftop views beautiful open room with lovely widely spaced-out tables set in the greenery lit with romantic lighting a chill vibe and an almost affordable American classics menu. I‚Äôm a semi-retired sommelier & they offer excellent wines by the glass including my all-time fave Napa bubbles; Schramsburg Rose. ‚Äú2 glasses please !‚Äù with 2 caesar salads split a burger and french fries split one glass of a Super Tuscan red with the burger and we‚Äôre out the door(@160. plus tip) I sorta want to dance so we check out Automatic Slim‚Äôs on Washington where we danced in April but it‚Äôs just roaring loud so we settle for a nightcap of Prosecco(x2@28.) at the very chill Malaparte(Washington & Bethune) then head back to bed. 9.6 miles walked.  FRI ‚Äì I grab a couple of pastries(14.) from the local shop and we Uber(47.) to our noon appointment at the Guggenheim. I also haven‚Äôt been back there in ~30 years. We‚Äôre excited to see the small Picasso show of paintings he did in Paris while just a 19 and 20yr old kid. Breathtaking. The main exhibition there was the Gego retrospective and I‚Äôm so delighted to have discovered this amazing South American artist. She was very prolific over several decades of work and simply evolved while always speaking the same mathematical language of lines. Color-me e‚Äôffing blown-away. The museum cafe has excellent Italian coffee btw. We decided to walk around the Upper East Side a bit window shopping along Madison Ave stopping for a glass of white wine at Siena Caf√© on 3rd (happy hour 2@21.) before walking thru Central Park. I had never seen the Onassis Reservoir or Strawberry Fields. The park itself seemed peacefully un-crowded that day perhaps because of the heat. It‚Äôs cooled-down to just 90 degrees this day(sarcasm). We then catcha taxi on CP West and we go all the way down 8th Ave back to the Village(32.). Past vast humanity and directly thru this massive city. We grab a couple glasses of a nice Rose and some guacamole & chips at the very kitschy and air-conditioned Cowgirl on Hudson(48.) We then stop at Sea Grape wine shop to grab a couple of things for the crib and I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. Very open and helpful Sommeliers working there and a really nice selection.  We walk around the village for a while and end up at Johns of Bleeker St. for pizza. You gotta Google this place as it‚Äôs always got a line out the door for their amazing coal-fired pies. A carafe of house Rose we split a massive & excellent caesar salad and a medium pie & we‚Äôre out of there(100. including a fat tip for the great service) taking half of the pizza home for a midnight snack. 3.5 miles.  SAT ‚Äì Salt‚Äôs Cure again then stroll up the Hudson River Park north. We walk past the Drift Inn which is def noted for a visit next time. The Tiki bar & patio there look just my like my happy place. Flowers along the walkway of this park in full bloom and everyone is so beautiful along the river; I don‚Äôt want to leave. We wander over to Greenwich St where there is a street fair randomly happening. Window shop but show courageous levels of will power against the big spends. This is unlike our previous visit to the Village in April. We keep teasing each other about going into the Tarot card reading place but I am the one who always chickens-out. Glass of wine at D‚Äôartusi(45.) on 10th/Hudson while Google Maps drives us super crazy on these twisted and intersecting cobbled old streets. The sidewalks here are so narrow as to require single-file walking the side streets past the expensive brownstones & 3 story townhouses. I don‚Äôt understand all the dog ownership though. I‚Äôm a dog lover - but it seems more than a bit cruel to keep them while living in a city like this. I‚Äôm kinda glad it isn‚Äôt more crowded & touristy in the village as it‚Äôs already fairly crowded with the locals. It‚Äôs now 88 degrees and a bit cooler next to the river. We grab some Thai(lousy meal so it will go nameless) to take back to the apartment deciding on an early night. 3.5 miles.  SUN ‚Äì 6:30a Uber to EWR(88.) to find our flight out eventually(after 14 hours) cancelled due to huge storms shutting down every east-coast airport from Miami to Boston that day. Arghhh. Dynamic pricing due to the number of stranded passengers that night meant that the airport Marriott was 615. for the one night. OH; hell NO. My son in law was stuck coming back from Florida and is forced to rent a car and drive back to NYC. 2 days up the I-95. Mind you these storms caused flash flooding and people died in Vermont so I‚Äôm really not complaining about our modest difficulties. We get out of Newark the next morning having spent the night at the flea-bag no-tell motel.  Cheers ,Eric Natural,New York City,Grand Rapids...

Hi I am looking for recommendations for hotels very close to Penn Station as I will be coming in late and want a hotel I can quickly walk to. May 19-21 2 people. Budget isn‚Äôt super strict but probably no more than $1200 for the two nights - would love to keep it under that. I have been to NYC many times and this isn‚Äôt my personal favorite area to stay but this time it‚Äôs what I would like to do just for convenience - would like to avoid late night subways once I get into Penn Station. I like more than bare bones accommodations and would love something more than a basic Hilton Garden Inn or the like. What are your best suggestions? Thanks! ,MamaB785,New York City,United States
We'd love to go to NYC just to see the Tonight Show. We have the links and know where to TRY to get these tickets - but SNL is a lottery (and we're getting a bit old to stay up that late anyway) so we're hoping to find Tonight Show tickets at some point. Does anyone know WHEN the calendar is updated and how hard it is to get tickets? Will we know enough in advance to hop on a train in the morning and get there in time (we live in Washington DC)? Any tips and advice is much appreciated! ,keerstn,New York City,Silver Spring...

Hi everyone    My wife and 10 year old daughter are excited to attend the Dutchess County Fair next month and I unfortunately can't join them. I don't know much about the Rhinebeck and Kingston areas but want to make sure that the Hampton Inn in Kingston that they have reserved for the night is in a safe area. They are staying for 1 night but will be driving there around 10 p.m. from Rhinebeck and I don't want them staying anywhere that might be dangerous. (I am not suggesting that it is - I'm just totally unfamiliar with the area.). Any guidance that you can offer re: this would be greatly appreciated - thank you! ,NYTravelerBD,Catskill Region,Westchester County...

We will be travelling for over a month so we have large suitcases we have just read the measurements and sizes our cases are just within limits and one over the size. Are they very strict with case sizes or does no one check at the airport and just process baggage through. If it is going to cost us extra we would rather purchase before we leave rather than pay excess on all our flights.  Thanks for any advice ,Holidays _ 60fam,New York City,"Sydney, Australia"

Is it worth it to do the 102nd and 86th floors or just 86th? With the time reservations are you only allowed 15 minutes on the observation deck? If we only went with the 86th floor are the exhibits also included? Is there a line even with reservations? How long should we budget for the visit? Is the military discount only for service members or does it include dependents? Any other useful info appreciated. ,Beth C,New York City,
I would like to report a company calling itself ReservationCounter.Com. I accidentally clicked on it while trying to make reservations for 2 rooms at the Best Western Plus in Ticonderoga NY. I thought it was the Best Western Site and inadvertently made my reservation through them. Note: I placed the reservation on May 2 2018 for 1 night on July 3 2018. While checking into the hotel I learned the actual price was $119 plus tax per standard queen room. When I alerted the company that they had overcharged me for the 2 rooms they said the hotel must have changed the rate. However the hotel manager said the $119 rate plus tax was the same in May as in July. Reservation Counter charged me $141.09 per room plus a service fee of $12.99 and a tax recovery charge of $62. 04 for a total of $367. 21 instead of the $282.18 I would've paid. They refused to refund any monies and tried to blame it on the hotel! Beware of this site!~!  Sherry ,Sherry A,,"Goodyear, Arizona"

Visiting for a weekend in August - 1st time for kiddos - 13 and 15. Have most of the highlights covered but was going to do Saturday 'north' and start with a visit to the Met (2-3 hours say 10-1) and then spend the majority of the afternoon in Central Park before our 4pm visit to see Tay Tay's outfits :-). I was originally thinking we should rent bikes to be able to see more of the park but am now thinking we might not have that much time and should just walk around? We'll likely have like 1-3:30 to spend time at the park and see what we can.    Welcome any thoughts. Is this too lofty and we should scrap the bikes or go for it and do an hour or two rental to see a good amount of the park?    THANKS! ,LouLou630,New York City,"Atlanta, GA"
My husband daughter and I will visit NY for the first time next month Aug 18-22. We are planning to visit as many of the standard must see places as possible such as : ESB 911 Memorial Highline. Summit One SOL Central Park Brooklyn Bridge etc and we will attend a Broadway show (most likely Lion King).    So from doing research. I saw that Midtown West is a highly recommended area due to its central walkable location and being close to transportation options. I thought I had found some good hotel options using the hotel map feature but reading through the forum threads maybe not. I am second guessing myself based on comments read and again this is our first visit so I am depending on the guidance from my TA family.    I have strongly considered:    1. Motto Hotel by Hilton Chelsea (Original choice before reading Midtown West was a better area)    2. Park Terrace Hotel (with fees this is pushing above my budget as they require you to book a studio room although the cheaper premier room has the same number of beds uuuhgghhh)    3. Crowne Plaza Hy36 Manhattan (It seemed like a good option location wise but now I am reading it may be in a the meh sketchy less desireable south area as stated in other forum posts)    For us we like newer modern styles clean hotels with decent food/bar and in a safe walkable area as we will eat out 90% of the time but may opt to dine in the hotel once or twice. Two beds is a must. I like to try local eateries my husband likes to grab a scotch and I would like to be able to walk my 12 year old daughter to a park to stores/mall to shop sightsee etc. Are any of my options listed good ones? If not what do you suggest in the budget range if $300-$400 per night including fees/taxes! ,cypjg,New York City,"Spring Branch, Texas"

I'm aware there are citypasses etc available but I am thinking of prepaying tickets directly with venues the day before if weather justifies it if that's easier for rescheduling.  I want to experience TOTR One World One Vanderbilt and the STatue of Liberty cruise.    I am planning an itinerary for myself factoring in also travel time and waiting times as well as times to actually enjoy doing what I'm going to.    For the observation decks and SOL cruise if I prepay online through their respective official sites does this help cut down waiting times if lines are long or does it not make any difference?  Research suggests waiting times at these places are about an hour each regardless of time of day as they're popular.    Thank you. ,carljohnson,New York City,"Kent, England"

Traveling from Indiana with family of 3. Staying in Jersey City close to Hoboken. Identified Secaucus Train Station as closest to hotel less than 2 miles.    Day 1 - Plan to drive my own vehicle from hotel to Liberty State Park to visit Statue of Liberty from Jersey side.    Days 2-4 - Plan to take a train from Secaucus train station to NY Penn Station 3 days in a row to tour NY City in a Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour fashion.    My questions revolve around the above itinerary:    Day 1 - Since the Liberty State Park parking is advertised to be plenty I plan to drive to park there to board the ferry anything I need to be aware of w.r.t gotchas? Google Maps says it is 20 minutes from my hotel to the State Park and I will be driving around 9 am - how much extra time do I give myself if I have to be at Statue of Liberty by 11 am?    Days 2-4 - I have identified parking close to Secaucus train station at $30 per day. Uber costs me about $10 one way so $20 both ways. Kind of a push if you ask me though I am leaning towards Uber because of reduced hassle of parking and walking while Uber drops me off closer (I am assuming??). However if my family chooses to stay behind to see Times Square at night and it is around 10 pm that we return will I have any issues getting an Uber from Secaucus train station? Has anyone used the parking by Secaucus train station? It says the hours are till 10 pm but if I have parked and already paid and return after 10 pm will I be fine?    Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks ,Chad S,,Indianapolis...

We're staying in the financial district for a week in June and looking for nice Pubs/Bars that serve good simple food. Recommendations don't need to be just in that area happy to travel to get the right atmosphere.  Bars with happy hours that are used by locals go straight to the top of the list!

I had a lovely French Viognier in a restaurant at the weekend for less than $30 don't think I've ever paid anywhere near that figure in the USA. ,Craig M,New York City,Lytham St Anne's...
My mother is coming form Brazil to visit and she will have a lay over in NY. I will meet her there and we will spend 3 days. She is older does not speak English and she gets tired of walking easily.  I would like to take her in a tour that gives an overview of the city without making her extremely tired.  I have never been to NY myself so I don't have much idea on where to start. She likes beautiful views scenic places and areas where you can sit and watch people.  These are the places I was thinking but I don't know how to divide them between the days:  - Central Park  - Times Square  - Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island  - Brooklyn Bridge  - 9/11 Memorial  - Top of the Rock  She is not interested in museum nor shopping.  Is there a hop on hop off bus that covers all this places? How should I divide them between the days? Anything to add? Thank you so much! ,Tathiana S,New York City,"Marietta, Georgia"
Hi All    We will be visiting NYC during an upcoming weekend and one of our two teens is in a walking boot for a shin fracture (winding down his 8 weeks in the boot). We will be taking the train in from Long Island (visiting family) to see a Saturday matinee Broadway show and will have some time before and after. I have a few questions for locals:    1. Ideas for things to do with a teen in or near Times Square (location of the show) that won't involve *too* much walking? (I know this is a tough ask for NYC.) Our teen in the walking boot is interested in food pop culture history sports entertainment etc. and our older daughter is pretty flexible. Another idea is to take an Uber to a different (but not too far) destination.    2. We will be looking for places to eat dinner and lunch that have vegan options. Suggestions?    3. We will be back on Long Island Saturday night into Sunday. Any suggestions for light things to do there that would be fun for teens and not too much walking?    Thanks in advance for ideas! ,New England Sally,New York City,Newton...

Hi! My bf and I are to be coming to NYC from Boston for a concert in August. We need a hotel to stay in for one night after the show.

My 18 yo and I are planning a day in Dumbo next month during our week in NYC. We'll likely get a later start to the day and take the subway there from UWS. Daughter is a bit of an artist so we thought this might be a fun/different day. Here is a list of things we'd like to see but not sure of the best order to do them. Any opinions/feedback?    -Main Street Park  -Jacques Torres chocolate  -Jane‚Äôs carousel  -Front Street for photo op of Manhattan Bridge  -Dumbo walls (York between Adams & Pearl)  -Front General Store  -Timeout Market ‚Äì rooftop park for views  -Juliana‚Äôs Pizza    Considering the sunset walking tour of Dumbo starting at 5:30 with Free Tours by Foot and walking back to Manhattan afterwards to see the city skyline lit up. Tour includes: Brooklyn Heights Brooklyn Promenade as sunset starts Dumbo at twilight and ends at Fulton ferry landing). Tour ends at 8pm.    Likely take an uber or taxi back to hotel ,jocelyner986,New York City,"Winnipeg, Canada"

What's the simplest most cost-effective way for the two of us to get from Radio City Apartments (142 W 49th Street) to Laguardia at around noon? We'd rather not get a taxi - too exey especially in NY traffic.    We'll have 2.5 cases (3 in effect) and we're not averse to a bit of walking (but not too much).    Thanks in anticipation. ,mfj,New York City,"Sydney, Australia"

We are visiting NYC in early August and staying in the theatre district/Times Square area for four nights. My husband and I have visited New York several times before but it will be the first time for my kids ages 12 and 14. My family often complains I over schedule what we do on vacation (rude) so I tried to leave room for exploring shopping or returning to anything that caught our eye.    We have Go City explorer passes for four attractions and don't plan to visit any museums or the theatre on this trip. At the moment I'm making a list of restaurants for each neighborhood we'll visit since I'm not sure what our timing will be like but we'll probably be snacking along the way and eating as many pizza slices and bagels as we can.    Day 1 (Saturday) - Arrive in the early morning at La Guardia spend the day exploring Central Park evening exploring Times Square    Day 2 (Sunday) - Explore some more visit NYPL Grand Central Station then TV & Movie Bus Tour (11 am). Later in the day subway to Chelsea to see Little Island Chelsea Market then walk the High Line to visit the Edge and Hudson Yards    Day 3 (Monday) - Visit the Empire State Building in the morning subway to Brooklyn and explore Dumbo and the waterfront walk across the Brooklyn Bridge maybe explore the Financial District if not tired. I have plans in the evening so my husband and kids are own their own.    Day 4 (Tuesday) - Explore Nolita Little Italy Chinatown then Harry Potter Store and I'll try to convince them to let me visit The Strand bookstore. Afternoon doing the Circle Line Landmarks boat tour.    Tell me what you think. Is this itinerary okay or could we squeeze more in? Please share any suggestions or tips you have. Thank you! ,Book Momma,New York City,Toronto

My daughter (12) and I are coming to New York next week (from New Zealand) and we arrive late on Saturday night at JFK. Our hotel is on 42th Street Manhattan. Is it right we can best take a yellow cab from the Airport to the hotel? We will have both have 2 large trolleys with us (as we travel to Europe after New York). We will stay for 4 days. Is there something like a subway pass for these days or should we get a hop on hop off bus ticket? I would be very grateful for your advice. Thanks ,Jo,New York City,
I am planning a fall trip to visit my sister in Northeastern Ohio (I live in New Mexico). We are talking about doing about a 6 night trip in order to see the great fall colors I have heard about. In the west we have many beautiful places but not many to get reds and oranges. After seeing some YouTube videos the Adirondacks look appealing. Distance wise it is a little closer than Vermont.    When traveling I like to avoid staying just one night in a place but not a hard and fast rule. Lake Placid seems like a good place to spend at least two nights maybe even three. What other places would you recommend? It seems like New England is known for fall colors and when I saw a couple of videos listing top 5 or 10 places for fall colors I did not see the Adirondacks on any list. I love taking pictures of mountains and lakes from the videos I have seen I can't imagine how any other places can be much better.    I am thinking if I had to guess a good time of the year the second week of October should be decent if peak colors come early or late.    Gary    I ,gstepic,Adirondack,"Albuquerque, New..."

Hi guys! My fiance and I are travelling to NYC in 2 weeks it is our first time there! People keep telling me how expensive it is! I am just wondering how much spending money for 2 people for the 5 nights would be realistic allowing you to do what you would like I have the accommodation booked and paid and also a helicopter trip booked and paid. Would 4000‚Ç¨ for both be enough? We want to be able to do what we want and not have to worry example a broadway show a NY Yankees game observation decks etc. We dont plan on shopping per say for clothes etcc. And we also wont be dining in michelin star restaurants! So its really for attractions and ubers/taxis. Also could someone explain to me about tipping? Is it included in your bill or separate? Also do you tip everywhere? Like if i get a meal at mcdonalds do you tip? üòÖ thanks in advance everyone!! ,Lisac93,New York City,

I have read on TA - to purchase Broadway e-tickets use the PlayBill website only. I want to purchase e-tickets to ensure good seats as there are four of us.

I want to avoid exorbitant booking fees. Please verify that Playbill is the best website to purchase e-tickets. Many thanks. ,james A,New York City,

Hi I‚Äôm visiting with my teen daughter this fall and she loves to bike. It‚Äôs not our first time in the city and she‚Äôs done a carriage ride in the park but it was several years ago. I‚Äôm considering renting bikes to tour CP since biking is her ‚Äúthing‚Äù and have a few questions -  Can we see all the major sights from bike-allowed areas?  How long should we allow to ride most of the park? I‚Äôm thinking we might turn and go around the reservoir if there‚Äôs a path allowing us to do that?

It is wonderfully hot humid & sunny today and just right for a morning and afternoon on the Hudson River and the tree-filled lawns of Liberty State Park (New Jersey) in the shadows of the Manhattan skyline the SOL Ellis Island the historic train terminal (and passenger shed) the Empty Sky (NJ 9/11 memorial) and the Liberty Science Center and Planetarium.    It is very easy to get there from the Brookfield Water Ferry Terminal (Slip #2); the trip takes only about 15 minutes and leaves you a short stroll to spectacular City views of the Empire State Building to the Freedom Tower to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and beyond‚Ä¶.    It is also noteworthy that the SOL/Ellis Island ferries that disembark from the Park usually do NOT require advanced reservations for general admission (though advanced reservations for the pedestal and crown are required).    Afterwards we all headed back to the City for a late lunch and beers at P.J. Clarke‚Äôs located in Brookfield Plaza along the Hudson River.    None of us had ever been to Liberty State Park but now we can highly recommend a visit. Try it!    CH ,CasaHoffa,New York City,"Huatulco, Mexico"

Hi all I‚Äôve prepared an itinerary for my 7 days in NY (incl. travel) but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs viable. If anyone has any comment on it I‚Äôd be grateful. I have a few specific questions below but if it outright does not work please don‚Äôt hesitate to say. I appreciate your time. Some of the days I admittedly organise around food meaning I may be backtracking but that‚Äôs ok with me provided there‚Äôs enough time in the day presuming there‚Äôs no better way to organise it.    I should add I‚Äôm a solo traveller visiting in September. I tend to move fast and typically like to be outside of the hotel 7am - 11pm.    Wednesday:  A travel day but could try a cocktail and snack at Cervo‚Äôs an evening boat ride on the Hudson/east river for views a slice at scarr‚Äôs pizza (pepperoni and warm honey dip) to end the night.    Any recommendations for casual boat ride to take in the landscape at night?    Thursday:  Leo‚Äôs bagel (bagel and drip) morning in Brooklyn/dumbo via Brooklyn bridge back to manhattan golden diner (chicken katsu lunch) stroll through Chinatown can try snacks from Mee Sum and Malaysia beef jerky tenement museum ghostbusters firehouse if time 9/11 memorial and museum (otherwise another day) end day at battery park and Staten Island ride (research times when is too dark to view statue).    Any recommendations for dinner?    Friday:  Grand central viewing Chrysler and Empire State 7th street burger (cheeseburger probably) Bryant park midtown comics MoMA 5th avenue to times sq broadway show if any on rooftop bar (pod 39 have one?)    Any recommendations for breakfast dinner snacks in the area?    Saturday:  The high line and Chelsea shopping around Greenwich avenue? Washington sq park oscar Wilde restaurant (light lunch) Union square the strand los tacos no1 (adobada on flour) Rockefeller and Summit One Via Carota (if possible to get a reservation) IFC centre possibly    Any recommendations for breakfast?    Sunday:  Breads bakery Met Central Park (Belvedere castle Bethesda terrace) Banh (late lunch) Guggenheim Edge Hell‚Äôs Kitchen maybe the meatball shop?    Monday:  Katz‚Äôs deli or russ and daughters queue dependant merchant‚Äôs house il buco alimentari (crispy artichoke) wander perhaps to Seward garden factory tamal (mole pobano) visit queens?    Any recommendations for things to do in queens? Dinner or dessert perhaps?    Tuesday:  Travelling in the evening but consider lunch at Thai Diner (try the seafood)    Any recommendations for things to do in the AM on a travel day?    To try and fit in:  Street hot dog (presumably this will organically happen)  Good sushi  Desserts  Oysters  Lobster  Radio city  Sports  Location geared towards shopping ,Adam C,New York City,

Hi all! I will be in NYC (first time ever) for 9 days beginning of September. I really like birds and always spend some time while traveling to watch the local ones :) I know it's not the easiest thing to do in NYC but as I am on the American continent I would like to try to find and see a hummingbird. Do you know any place where it might be possible to see them? Best would be an accessible feeder. A trip to a place nearby would be an option too!

Yesterday we hosted 3 friends from Ecuador. They had been to NYC before but had never been to the Little Island the Highline Hudson Yards and The Edge. So off we went to make a day of it strolling through the Village to the west side and then north resting along the way to hydrate (we're all in our 70's) and talk. The Little Island and the Highline are all abloom the Hudson Yards offers tasty food (try Little Spain or the nearby food trucks) and The Edge provides some of the grandest views of the City and New Jersey. There is a concierge at the foot of The Edge (outside) who hailed a taxi that gave us service back to the Village for dinner at Da Andrea (13th Street between 5th & 6th Avenues). It was a wonderful way to spend a gorgeous day with friends and catch-up.    CH ,CasaHoffa,New York City,"Huatulco, Mexico"
I will be traveling with 3 friends in early November and we are considering adding a 1 day stop-over in NYC on our return to the states. We would be arriving on 11/3 & would need to fly out late afternoon/early evening 11/4. Questions: None of us have ever been to NYC so we're unsure of the best airport option to fly in/out best area to stay to be able to see highlights of the city etc. We are unfortunately on a very limited timeframe since we will be returning from out of country and must be back home on Sunday. I have looked at the 2.5 hr Manhattan cruise from Pier 83 since we would all like to see the Statue of Liberty. I've found the travel info to be a little overwhelming so I welcome your thoughts. ,Melissa K,New York City,"Waco, Texas"
Hi I‚Äôm bringing my two teenage daughters to NYC in February 2024. I‚Äôve never been myself and so after any useful advice but in particular am I better of booking excursions/particular sightseeing places in advance?

Can't beat the summer in NYC! It's going to start to heat up but there is still loads to do/see.    (Events thread originally started back in the day by ztaks!)    (None of the vids in this thread I post are mine.)    The BIGGEST summer event in NYC......    *****The 4th of July fireworks sponsored by Macy's!*****    July 4 2023  Appr 9:20-ish pm  FREE    ***Location and best viewing locations to be confirmed.***    This July 4th tradition started in 1976 though there was a fireworks display in 1958 on July 1 to celebrate Macy's 100th anniversary.    It's the biggest in the USA! It's always crowded at the main viewing locations and other parts of the city...so prepare to get there early!    In past years I have caught them live down by the South Street Seaport on the West Side Highway at the Brooklyn Promenade in NJ and on a few rooftops.    There will be street closures in/around the areas of the entry points to the viewing areas. Don't stress this if you are visiting and not taking in the fireworks. You will not notice if you are not in those areas.    There is a soundtrack that can usually be heard on the 1010 WINS radio station.    From last year:    -The NYPD reminds spectators that no large backpacks large coolers lawn chairs lawn blankets umbrellas or alcoholic beverages will be allowed in the viewing areas. All restricted items are subject to search and seizure.    Security will be tight so give yourself extra time. Do get out there and take it in if you can!    Click back on the link below for additional details and best viewing location as they are released::    https://www.macys.com/s/fireworks/    https://youtu.be/00vU_KtMhxY    ^  Vid shows what to expect at a Queens NY park on the 4th. Start it at appr 19 minutes! Note...that really wasn't one of the main viewing areas hence the lawn chars lawn blankets backpacks umbrellas coolers and probably booze! ,ter1413 üá∫üá≤,New York City,"Brooklyn, New York"
I am looking at Philadelphia Orchestra opening night at SPAC with the fireworks display. I am trying to decide about seating. I haven't been to SPAC in many years and I am not sure about the seating. If you get seats inside the amphitheater how do you see the fireworks? Is the lawn seating better for this event? Thank you! ,travelerjmf,Saratoga Springs,Connecticut

We are planning to be in NYC on October 7-14 for my partner's 76th birthday. It is the first time in NYC for both of us. We would like to have a very memorable trip with rich sightseeing and experiences.    Which area should we stay in order to be able to walk to most of the principal attractions? We don't want to spend money on cabs nor lose time in subway. Do you have any hotel recommendations? Our budget would be 300-400 USD per night.  We also like to take our time to enjoy things and not rush things running everywhere.  I don't want my partner to get too tired 10 miles per day is manageable for us during our trips. Not more.    Also do you have recommendations for birthday dinner? A cult legendary place would be nice too.    Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much! ,U C K,New York City,France
We are a family of 4 with 2 girls (6 and 4 years old) who just came back from a NYC trip. We had such a great time in the city that we want to return for 5 days in the beginning of August but would like to rent a car one or two days for a road trip out of NYC.

Any recommendations or ideas?. Thanks!. ,tatoweb,New York City,"Davie, Florida"
I have been told the gay scene at the Pines and Cherry Grove is pretty dead on weekdays in August and only comes alive at weekends is this actually true?

I will be visiting Niagara Falls from the Canadian site. I wonder whether it would be nice to walk over the rainbow bridge to see more of the falls.

If you have never been to Gracie Mansion (the Mayor‚Äôs residence at East 88th Street and East End Avenue) we can highly recommend the tour. Reservations are always needed.    The place has a rich history and is surrounded by lovely gardens and parklands. We went for the first time this morning and getting there is quite easy on the East River ferries. What a surprise we had towards the end of the tour when a meeting room door opened and out walked Mayor Adams Gerry Nadler and Hakeem Jeffries among others. Handshakes and friendly questions ensued.

I‚Äôm travelling soon to New York with 5 people and was wondering if it‚Äôs cheaper to get a taxi from Newark airport or the train.

Can any one advise me of a boat tour/ride from Buffalo (not Niagara Falls) that goes to Niagara Falls and back? Also is it ok to stay at a hotel that is further east of the Canal Area or should I get one closer to the river? I do prefer to the west. It would be better since I have trouble walking. I would get one to the east if i knew it were safe and really had to. I dont mind having to pay for a taxi but only if i had to. Ty for an answer. ,americanpatriot73,Buffalo,
We are 4 adults all seniors (60's). We'd like to go to NYC from Aug 16 to 21. But we don't know the city so we're trying to figure out the best area to stay based on what we want to do. We'd like to see Times Square and spend an afternoon at Central Park and check out some great restaurants in the evenings for dinner and go to the Rockefellar and a small bit of shopping pop by Madison Square Gardens and we'd like to walk up and down some busy streets with street vendors music street festivals etc. We don't mind some walking approx 15 minutes to 1/2 an hour walk from one spot to another would be ok. I'd love any and all feedback suggestions of areas to look for hotels etc. We don't need high end luxury hotel as long as it's clean and a bit quiet we're ok.....just don't want a dump. ,Yenom2023,New York City,

Our family recently visited NYC after 8 long years away. We were SO excited to be back in NYC & had a blast! This is my attempt at sharing some info in case it might help others. TA always helps me‚Äîthank you all! I‚Äôm long winded so I‚Äôll apologize for that now. :) Our travel style is a mix of some planned activities some spontaneous moments lots of walking around & taking in the sites of the city & we never try to ‚Äúsee & do‚Äù everything. Breaks are good!    My husband son (17) & I flew into Newark on the 21st. We intended to take some type of public transit into the city but we messed up by not really researching how to make that happen. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not that hard but we ended up near the passenger pickup area & just got a Lyft. Gotta admit‚Äîit was nice to put the luggage in the back & just relax on the (long) ride.    We stayed at The Cambria Hotel NYC-Chelsea (123 W 28th) As someone on here pointed out to me it‚Äôs ‚ÄúChelsea adjacent‚Äù but it was a great location with easy access to subway stops buses coffee shops food etc. It‚Äôs also on a street full of flowers plants & trees for sale during the day‚Äîso pretty to walk through & it smelled lovely! Where do all the plants go when the evening rolls around??    The room was nice & large by NYC standards‚Äî2 queen beds a desk area with a chair refrigerator & microwave small closet plus an upholstered chair (we did reserve a ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù room). The bathroom however was TINY (if you‚Äôve ever been inside an RV bathroom‚Äîyou have the image!). Nice toiletries though good water pressure & certainly functional. Staff were always friendly when we encountered them & were able to hold our luggage for us when we checked in (room wasn‚Äôt ready until later) & out. Elevators were fast! One thing to note: there is no daily housekeeping unless you specifically request it. We decided to request fresh towels daily & it worked out fine.    I‚Äôd posted here for food recommendations nearby for our first afternoon since I knew we‚Äôd be starving. Y‚Äôall were so helpful! I had more restaurant ideas than we could get to unfortunately. Our first meal was Korean barbecue at 319 5th Avenue. Absolutely delicious & probably our favorite meal of the trip! We went with the Beef Set for 2 (prime tenderloin top blade & prime short rib) which comes with rice plus all kinds of vegetables & sides. We also ordered a few appetizers & it was plenty of food for the 3 of us.    Transportation for us was a mix of subways Lyft/Uber & taxis. We used OMNY for the subway‚Äîloved it! My gosh it was so easy to just tap our phones & go. We went to Philadelphia after our time in NYC & their Septa system for their public transportation is not nearly as easy & user friendly.    That evening we had tickets to Six at the Lena Horne Theater (256 W 47th). Loved it! It‚Äôs so clever fast paced & has such catchy songs. The women were fantastic both the cast & the all female band. Highly recommend!    We went to Bagel Pub (350 7th Avenue) for breakfast the next day because it was close & we really wanted NYC bagels. Loved it! I‚Äôm still thinking about my strawberry cream cheese schmear (not sure I spelled that right‚Äîha!). Then we were off to the Chelsea High Line‚Äîwe‚Äôd never been here before. Our first stop was Hudson Yards for a little shopping (my son loves Uniqulo & we don‚Äôt have any close to us) and a bathroom break. I‚Äôll add here that I was dealing with a medical issue that popped up about a week & 1/2 before our trip. Definitely slowed me down so we had to take a lot of breaks to let me sit & rest. I was so very happy to always find a place to do this & also always got seats on the subway!    We got on the High Line stopping often to take pictures. The art work along the way plus all the trees plants & flowers were absolutely lovely. We were also there right after the yellow man sculpture had been (unexpectedly) installed so got to see that too! We made it to the Chelsea Market & spent time walking through there just checking out all the food options. It was packed so we ended up walking to another restaurant for a later lunch‚ÄîHao Noodle (343 W 14th). I don‚Äôt quite recall what we ate but it was all good. On our way there & back we just enjoyed walking through the area & taking it all in. Saw the Google headquarters too. Walking in New York is always a favorite of ours! We later went to Bryant Park & inside that branch of the NY Public Library. Such a gorgeous building!    That evening was a Yankees game. We were excited because it‚Äôd been 8 years since we‚Äôd been to Yankee Stadium. This was a perfect evening for baseball with cool weather no rain & we had good seats. Then the game started & it was awful; German gave up 10 runs I think in the first 2 innings. Boo. How ironic that he would go on to pitch a no hitter in his very next outing! It was also sad for us to not get to see Aaron Judge play. We ended up back at our hotel later in the night & went to Andiamo Pizza to grab a few slices (818 6th Avenue). Yum!    On Friday morning we were up early to catch the subway to Columbia for a college visit. This was our first time to go up that far in Manhattan. What a beautiful campus! The visit was a good one; our son loved it. After the visit we took a Lyft to Harlem Shake for lunch (100 W 124th); very tasty! Loved the jerk fries. It had started to rain during our college tour & the rain would continue on & off that day.    We headed to Central Park but really didn‚Äôt walk through much of it due to more rain. Just a funny memory: when our son was about 2 1/2 we came to NYC for a long weekend so we could go to Old Yankee Stadium one last time. Andy Petit was pitching that game & our boy kept saying throughout the game that he needed to go ‚Äúdown there (on the field) to see Jeter.‚Äù We asked a guy near us with dark hair to pretend to be Jeter & it worked! During that weekend we went to Central Park for several hours letting our son play & just roam about. We have an adorable picture of him eating fruit snacks on a giant rock‚Äîhe‚Äôd had a little tumble & was crying until Dad saved the day with fruit snacks‚Äîtears dried up quickly! We jokingly said we needed to recreate that pic minus the tumble but it was too wet this time for sitting on rocks.    We walked a bit on 5th Avenue & then headed back to our hotel for some rest. Later that evening we headed to Rockefeller Center to walk around that area. There appeared to be a wedding or some festive event at St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral so we couldn‚Äôt go in. Still it was fun to see the roller skating rink area & just all around there. Next was a walk over to Grand Central Station. It‚Äôs so pretty inside & I always love to pop in. We got a bit mixed up trying to figure out where to enter because we were over near the Met Life Building I think‚Ä¶some security guards saw us & ended up telling us we could go in through that area. They were also super nice & chatted with us a bit about our trip where we were from etc. Once we finally got back to the area around our hotel we walked over to Andiamo Pizza to grab some slices again for the boys. I‚Äôd gotten Sweetgreens earlier because I was craving a salad!    Saturday morning was our final outing in the city. Oh we got bagels again from the Bagel Pub‚ÄîI needed another NYC bagel before I could leave town! We took the subway to City Hall & walked a small part of the Brooklyn Bridge. Wow it was crowded! I‚Äôve never seen it that busy before. Still it was fun to walk it & take a few pics. The sky was so hazy & we couldn‚Äôt see the top of the Freedom Tower.    We walked around downtown for just a bit before taking the subway to get back to our hotel grab luggage & head to Moynihan Train Hall to catch our train to Philly. Grabbed a few goodies from the Magnolia Bakery inside there (very tasty) & ended up sitting on the floor as we waited for our train. The station is so huge & full of light but there are not many seating options. Did we get there too early? Probably so‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt have train transportation in Arkansas so we felt like it was better to be there early & wait rather than cut it close. Of course boarding the train was easy & we had a relaxing ride to Philly. I can‚Äôt even describe how much we love using the trains in the area‚Äîso much easier than flying not to mention much less expensive! It makes me sad & mad that I live in the South where the politicians are more concerned with enriching themselves & their billionaire cronies rather than making life better for our residents. I digress‚Ä¶sorry.    Oh before I forget‚Äîgelato! We went to Caffe Panna in Gramercy Park (77 Irving Place) one afternoon for gelato. SO good! They are only open Wednesday-Sunday 1:30-9:30. You can get your gelato topped with Panna (a yummy whipped cream-like topping) that they import from Italy. Loved this!    Fantastic trip to NYC! I hope we don‚Äôt wait another 8 years to return because I‚Äôd certainly like to revisit museums we‚Äôve either not been to at all or revisit museums we‚Äôve been to many years ago. And I‚Äôd love some nicer weather for Central Park. Hope to get to the Cloisters one day too. It goes without saying that there‚Äôs so much to see & do in the city & 3 days just flies by. Thanks to all here who answer a give suggestions etc. SO helpful! ,Lee4,New York City,Little Rock...

However now I am wondering if we should head straight to the Met when they open to ensure that we will be able to get in to see the special exhibit?

I am travelling solo planning to visit NYC for my first time in coming October or November for one week and I discover the lowest price for hotel will be the week Nov 12 in general Ôºàprice of flight tickets is similar for October and November Ôºâ.My budget is$230 max per night including all tax and other charges. I do not mind travelling 45min one way to Manhattan for sight seeing but I really hope to stay in a safe location with easy access from/ to airport.    Since I will be arriving in JFK Airport with my budget places like Aloft New York Brooklyn will be a reasonable choice. Any other suggestions? Thanks a lot! ,Maggie,New York City,
Some tours are costing $140 to see MOTM COTW and some free stuff. But there combined ticket per person is $52 when bought individually.  Am I missing something?

Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids ages 11 and 14) are planning a NYC trip 8/20-8/24. We'll be taking the train to Penn Station. I'm looking for one room with two queen beds (double can be fine if necessary) and below $450 nightly inclusive of taxes/fees. We have status at IHG hotels. Open to a modern or traditional vibe.    I've found tons of availability and options but am having trouble narrowing down neighborhoods.    Here's my loose itinerary if that helps settle location. Any advice on the itinerary is welcome as well.    Day 1: Arrive by train late morning visit Empire State Building maybe a city lights tour (boat or bus)    Day 2: Central Park and Museum of Natural History    Day 3: 9/11 Museum and Ellis Island    Day 4:  Open day : evening kids want to see Time Square and a show    Day 5:  Leave from Penn Station midday    Thanks! ,mampy,New York City,"Washington, DC"
Thought I would do a quick trip report for anyone planning a similar trip. The trip was to celebrate my theatre mad daughters 18th birthday. My mum & her sister also joined us on the trip but they had their own itinerary. This report is for mine & my daughters part of the holiday.    Friday 30th June    Our flight got in at 6pm to JFK but the immigration line was so long. It took over 3 hours from getting off the plane to getting in a cab.    We stayed at the Rui Manhattan Plaza on W47th. I chose this hotel specifically because of the location to the theatres. The hotel is quite new so very clean and well presented. Room size was fine for us bed very comfortable. A/C was controllable. Free water in rooms. Breakfast was included which we were very grateful for. It had a really good selection always enough food available and set us up well for the day. It also has theatre theming inside the lobby. We were really pleased with it as although this area is very hectic it worked so well for us to keep being able to pop back throughout the day to drop off shopping and get changed for the theatre.      On arrival night it was obviously late by the time we arrived so we literally just went for a walk around the theatres to see them all lit up before going to bed.    Pre cursor - everywhere we went or ate is purely because it will have something to do with theatre/musicals/tv show that she wanted to do.    We tried to only see shows that aren‚Äôt on in (or have announced they are coming to) London    Day 1 - Sat 1st July    Morning: Shopping - One Schubert alley Theatre circle Disney store Hersheys and a few 7 Elevens. We went to the Broadway Up Close booth and bought a passport where you can stamp the pages of the theatres you visit.    We skipped lunch as we weren‚Äôt hungry.    Matinee - Sweeney Todd (we pre booked tickets via the official website from the U.K)    Dinner - Applebees - food was mediocre as expected but my daughter was happy!    Evening - Off Broadway show The Gospel According to Heather (picked these tickets up at the TKTS box office on the day)    Day 2 - Sunday 2nd July    Morning: American Girl    Lunch - Krispy Kreme    Matinee: Parade (pre booked in U.K. via an offer on today tix app for $99 - received tix on the day and were front row of mezz so happy)    Dinner - Olive Garden - food wasn‚Äôt great but realistically she just wanted to try the breadsticks)    Evening: Chicago (got day seats from theatre at 10am) probably wouldn‚Äôt have chosen this show but only Chicago & MR seemed to have evening shows and we‚Äôve seen MR as it‚Äôs currently on in london)    It was raining so the red steps were closed so she managed to get some really good photos in from of them with them empty behind her.    Monday 3rd July  This was my daughters 18th birthday    Morning: more 7 Elevens and Target to buy lots of US snacks and drinks to take home.    Lunch - The American Girl cafe - had low expectations but the food was actually surprisingly ok.    We then went to Toy Tokyo The Public Theatre Mid Town comics and a few other shops in this area.    Dinner - 99c pizza we went to the one on the corner of 7th & W40th it was actually really nice!    Evening - Some Like it Hot (got day seats at theatre at 10am)    After this we went to Don‚Äôt Tell Mama but didn‚Äôt stay very long. She felt a bit young to be in there and obviously couldn‚Äôt have a drink.    Tuesday 4th July    Morning - the high line. An early and confusing start as the first section was closed but then we got caught in torrential rain so left it around half way. Caught the subway somewhere so my daughter could find a Mudville sign then onto the stonewall area. Walked to the drama book shop a different target and more 7 Elevens :)    Lunch: Schmakereys - amazing!!    Afternoon - museum of Broadway. We pre booked these in the U.K. as the first Tuesday of the month is cheaper. It was fantastic. I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews but we loved it and were in there over 2 hours. My daughter does musical theatre cosplay so was amazing to see some costumes up close and she loved all the photo opportunities. Would love something like this in the west end.    Dinner - Ellen‚Äôs Stardust Diner - only a 15 min wait daughter loved it. Food was rank and I felt that it had gone a bit downhill since our last visit.    Evening - we attempted to watch the fireworks. Wish we had just stayed at the hotel and watched them on tv. But we can say we saw them at least.    Wednesday 5th July    My mum & daughter went to the Empire State Building - booked a 9am slot the night before based on the weather forecast. Got there 15 mins early and let them straight in no queue but there was a big one forming as they left.    Matinee: Kimberley Akimbo (I got day seats from theatre at 10am)    Lunch - Juniors    Dinner - Gayles Broadway Rose - this was brilliant far better than the stardust diner and the food was actually really good. My daughter was really pleased as one of the performers she follows on tik tok was performing that night.    Evening: Funny Girl - got a 40% off discount code and got tickets at the box office. I think it was possibly because there were lots of understudies on but my daughter only really wanted to see Lea Michele anyway.    Thursday 6th July    Morning: Statue of Liberty - booked a 9am crown reservation slot. Was in battery park by 8.45 but was nearer 10 by the time we got inside the statue.    Afternoon: Coney Island - we spent a few hours here. We bought individual ride passes for the cyclone and wonder wheel as they were the only rides she wanted to do. Had a great afternoon weather was lovely and although the beach was busy the park didn‚Äôt seem crowded there was no wait for either ride.    Straight from here back to the hotel to pick up bags and a cab to the airport. We got a cab outside the hotel almost immediately.    She loved everything about the trip. She ticked off everything she wanted to do see and eat off her list.    The especially good things about the trip:    I forgot how walkable it is. We did between 15-25k steps a day. Did use the subway too for longer journeys and just paid per ride using contactless.    She loved the free playbills at the theatres and the fact that each show has its own keepsake soda cup or bottles of water - would love to see these things in the west end.    I know tipping is controversial on here but I was pleased to see that (presumably in lots of the tourist places) gratuity was indicated these days on the bill or there were options on the electronic pay devices. Made it much easier to work out. I went with the 20% option. At the theatre bars I tipped $1/2 per soda luggage I gave $2 a bag and left housekeeping $5 a day. Hopefully this was ok no one grumbled anyway.        And lastly a few not so good things:    We found a lot of people quite rude. There are obviously exceptions to this rule and we met a few lovely helpful people but overwhelmingly I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a particularly friendly place.    Stage door of the theatres in particular was not a nice experience. I also found it strange that the ensemble didn‚Äôt really come out and sign. My daughter likes anyone to sign her program but it felt like everyone was just waiting for the ‚Äòstars‚Äô    I didn‚Äôt like the metal detectors on the theatre entrances they made me feel unsafe. I‚Äôll admit I looked for the exits inside every enclosed space we entered. I don‚Äôt enjoy feeling that way.    The rubbish I was taken aback about how dirty it was there is literally garbage all over the sidewalks and roads. We last visited in 2018 and I felt it was much more noticeable this time.    The lack of Apple Pay and contactless. I am so used to just carrying a phone and paying for everything on Apple Pay these days. I wasn‚Äôt keen that people would take my card away when paying. I don‚Äôt like it out of my sight as it can be used contactlessly upto ¬£100. The first night I only had my phone and I had to go into the kitchen area to pay as they didn‚Äôt have handheld devices. I carried my card after that!    The food - I appreciate the places she chose weren‚Äôt what you call fine dining :) My daughter is vegetarian and doesn‚Äôt really eat dairy. In England all chain restaurants these days tend to have at least 5/6 vegetarian or vegan options on every menu. Lots of places also have separate vegetarian/vegan menus too. She was lucky if she had one option per menu on this holiday. We had to ask to adapt dishes in a few places as there was nothing. We could of course have eaten in actual vegan restaurants there I‚Äôm sure but she didn‚Äôt want to. I was just very surprised at the lack of vegetarian and vegan options on normal menus.    I do appreciate the things I‚Äôve said I didn‚Äôt like are just because they are different to what I know but thought these points may be useful to others coming from the U.K. ,teamc2015,New York City,"Chelmsford, United..."

We also enjoy walking through pretty areas such as the streets in Brooklyn Heights.    Can you suggest a neighborhood that might be a good option along with some points of interests and/or a good lunch stop.

Hi All  My husband and I are taking our middle son (17-yo) to NYC next week for a solo-kid trip. We have been before and have done most of the typical tourist activities and this trip is all about him. He is looking at colleges now and is interested in majoring in post film production (video editing sound/lighting etc.) so we are looking for experiences like that that may interest him. I've searched a good bit and this is all I've come up with:  Artechouse lights  Museum of moving image  Paley center for media    He also likes comics so we will take him to a store there.    Are there any other places/activities that may be worth a look? NYU does not give tours of their dept unfortunately but we may still visit the campus.

I am planning a three night trip to Manhattan and will be driving in from PA. We are seeing a Broadway show or two and seeing the usual sights.

I have a week to spend in the Adirondack Region and I thought I might also visit the Thousand Islands as Ive never been there and honestly I dont know much about them . Its one place I dont know anyone who ever went there    Before helping me realize I cannot leave the state of NY. I cannot go into Canada at this time which is why I am going to the Adirondacks in the first place    What are the main attractions in The thousand Islands. Looks to me like Boldt Castle is the top attractions. Are most of the attractions castles?    Where do people stay? Looks to me like the main place is Watertown NY but Alexandria Bay is closer to the Water and might be nicer (and Closer to Boldt Castle)    How many days do you need in the Thousand Islands. I have 7 days total and I am going to spend the rest in the Lake Placid area (WHich Ive been before and more familiar with) ,Queenstravelbuff,Alexandria Bay,New York City
Hi guys! I've just booked flights for me and my girlfriend to go to New York at Christmas - something we've both dreamt of since we were kids. It's a surprise and I want to book as many amazing Christmassy things as possible. So I just wondered if anyone had any tips? Whether that's any must-see places/attractions/things to do or maybe something that's more of a 'hidden gem'? Any tips or recommendations would be so appreciated to make her birthday as special as possible!

Has anyone been to the pasta class/experience at Aunt Jake's on the UES? I'm trying to make a reservation (I may be too early for an Aug 12 or 13th spot) but dates that are less than 30 days out seem to already be booked. Is it just a super small number of spots for each time slot or is it just that popular (and I'm just late to the party LOL) or a combination of both? We could potentially do it on Friday afternoon depending on available times-we have Sweeney Todd that evening and would prob want to change clothes before the show if Friday ends up working out. Suggestions welcome for any way to ensure a reservation when I'm within the date range! ,Tamara C,New York City,"Memphis, Tennessee"
My husband and I will be coming to the Finger Lakes for 6 nights in mid-July and I am trying to nail down our itinerary at a high level. We have never been to the area and our priorities are light hiking to waterfalls (due to a few issues we can‚Äôt do more than 4-5 miles) craft breweries relaxing with lake views (possibly combine with brewery visit!) and some sort of boat trip out on a lake. And hopefully some good meals and ice cream scattered throughout. We are not fine diners but like casual with good food preferably in an outdoor space.    We are spending 2 nights in Geneseo with plans to visit Letchworth possibly Stony Brook and definitely Other Half Brewing and Mortalis. We then shift over to spend 4 nights in Burdett hopefully to visit Watkins Glen Taughannock Treman and Buttermilk. Breweries are TBD but I see that Grist Iron Two Goats Scale House and Lucky Hare are all close together near Burdett. On Seneca it looks like Captain Bills or True Love are options to get out on the water itself. And as my husband is the craft beer fan more so than me I am hoping not to eat all our meals at breweries!! We are staying at Grist Iron Lodge which looks like it has nice views of the lake and definitely has proximity to a brewery.    Tentative itinerary  1. Day 1: Drive from Baltimore to Letchworth (approximately 5-6 hours). Is it worth stopping by Letchworth if we only have a few hours? Or Stony Brook? Or just head for a brewery?  2. Day 2: Letchworth drive and hikes? Maybe Stony Brook? I don‚Äôt have any restaurants on my list for the Geneseo area yet. Brewery visit  3. Day 3: can either spend more time in this area or head over to Burdett area. Looks like 1 ¬Ω hours approx.. with no stops. Or could stop along the way? Or head to one of the parks on our list? Add on brewery visit.  4. Day 4: Watkins Glen State Park followed by Taughannock? Followed by brewery visit?  5. Day 5: Treman State Park followed by Buttermilk? Brewery visit?  6. Day 6: Boat trip on lake? Or any park we were too tired to make it too?  7. Day 7: Depending on energy left may have time for one more hike before driving back to Baltimore    Days 4-6 are interchangeable depending on weather and energy. The many steps at some of the parks may call for more recovery time than I am building in. Or maybe we‚Äôll be all in and ready for more. Some recent injuries have left me unsure of what we can accomplish.    I am looking for any suggestions on itinerary timing restaurants favorite breweries ice creameries boating recommendations and any other ideas. I have learned a lot from this forum already.    Thank you in advance for your help. ,pcs15,Finger Lakes,"Baltimore, Maryland"

Hello! My 21 year told son and I will be in NYC for the first time this October. I've been working on our itinerary and would like some suggestions on Day 1 before I continue to work on the rest. We are staying in midtown and will be taking the subway to Battery Park to go to the Statue of Liberty. Here is what I have planned:    1. 9:00 am Statue of Liberty Crown tickets (already booked.) and then Ellis Island.  2. Lunch after thinking this will be around 1 or 2.  3. Wall Street Federal Hall Charging Bull Fearless Girl Trinity Church. (Don't necessarily need to see all these things.)  4. Then thinking of taking the subway into Brooklyn to explore DUMBO and then walk the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan.  5. Dinner possibly at Katz. My son really wants to go here.  We will be doing the 9/11 Museum and Memorial the next day. Crown tickets have already been purchased. :)    Please let me know your thoughts. Is it too much? We are city people and both enjoy walking but I thought it would help to take the subway into Brooklyn instead of walking the bridge to and from. Also would love some lunch suggestions near Battery Park/Street. Thank you! ,Melissa,New York City,
We are flying into NYC from Charlotte NC for the 1st time (we always drove when we lived in Baltimore). Looking for thoughts on which airport Newark or JFK would be the easiest to navigate in terms of getting into the city. I am interested in cost factors time it takes and where we would end up in Manhattan. Suggestions or opinions welcomed! Thanks ,LKG54,New York City,"Charlotte, North..."
I live in MN which is one of the states that has EDL/EID and got mine recently in preparation for a trip that will take us through Niagara Falls after careful research that showed I could use that instead of a passport for travel to/from Canada (which we will be doing on a road trip). However today when my wife took my daughter in to get theirs (my daughter has a disability and cannot drive so she was doing to get an Enhanced ID (EID) the lady who worked there and was taking the applications told her that no it cannot be used and she/we might get stuck in the country. Everything I have read online and my co-worker has a family member travel agent who said this is incorrect info. Can someone definitively tell me if this worker was just incompetent or is this true? The main point of getting an enhanced id over real id is that it's good for travel by land/sea...am I missing something? ,rjudson,Niagara Falls,
Hello everybody.  I have Statue tickets for the Statue with crown access for 9:00am. So what time should I leave my hotel in Times Square? Is 9:00 am the time I should board or the time I should actually be there at the Statue ?  I intend taking the subway.The last time I was in New York back in 2015 I remember that it was necessary to take the 1 train downtown to the South Ferry and be sure to sit in the first 5 cars of the train as only those cars doors open at the stop.  Is the process still the same?  Thank you in advance. ,eniviv,,Portugal

I'm cheap and hate paying $300+ a night for hotels for a solo trip. I'm seeing a lot of options near EWR where im flying into for $150 and I'll probably mostly be on the go so i was wondering if it is pretty easy to just take the path train into the city every day to save some money. Also is the path train reasonably safe late at night if im out drinking and by myself? Any other good areas to stay with easy access to the city that arent $3-400 a night and safe if im out late alone? ,M2003,New York City,"Des Moines, Iowa"

We were looking at the Park South Hotel (124 E 28th Street) based on the mostly +ve reviews on TA but don't see it recommended or mentioned in the forum area much. Also looking at Doubletree Midtown 5th Ave (25 W 51st St). -the price is similar. My inexperienced opinion is that there seems to be more touristy things close to the Doubletree. But am happy to be set straight on this and any pro/cons of the two hoods.    Most of us are first time tourists to NYC. Have booked the Edge Wicked and Blue Man Group so far. Taking transit is no problem for us. ,One_Carry_On_Bag,New York City,
Considering getting a train into Penn Station from JFK airport instead of an expensive taxi.    Is it easy with luggage or a nightmare? ,Ash13,New York City,"Southampton, United..."
Some trip reports work out great and honestly some just dont. this is a partial failure TR for the July 4th  2023 holiday    I actually have not been in NYC on July 4th since 2019  so this was the first time since then I was able to do NYC things on July 4th    My first stop was supposed to be the The Nathans Hot dog eating contest and then Coney Island. Many know I and trying to get some social media content and I thought Videos of the Hot Dog eating contest was a great idea.    To get from Queens to Coney Island by Subway really takes a long time and parking is impossile at Coney Island. What I do is drive to the Sheepshead Bay Subway station where I can usually find parking and then take the subway to Coney Island Its 4 stops and actually a nice ride as you can see the rides and the ocean from the train. Of course when I get there they are working on the Metro Card Machines and I dont have any money on my Metro Card and I cannot re-fil it (The station was not manned with a clerk). The workers told someone who paid to let me in since I coulndt re-load my card.    I got to Coney Island as they were announcing the women eating contestants. and I took was I thought was a video. However I seemed to have filmed the wrong direction and I took videos of the crowd You can see what the atmoshere was like but I failed to get a video of the event. And Of course I did not find this out until I got home.    https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSUtAAudVq/    Right by 12  it started to thunder and Lightning and then began to rain cats and dogs It took me almost 10 mins to get from the street to under the Subway entrance (They had a fence you had to walk around) and I was soaked . After about 30 the police told out the event was cancelled I checked on twitter and it was so I went home soaking wet not get video of the mens tournament and then found out I screwed up the womens tournament. It was a total failure. I was totaly soaked  wet and miserable    When I got home I found out that decicded to have the contest at 3 so I watched it on ESPN    My fireworks turned out much better. Many might know I am not a fan of attending the Macys fireworks show. Its a pain to get to from my part of queens I cant park so I have to take the Subway and the subway doesnt get that close to it. And when you get there is packed You have to stand and there isnt any bathroom. And if you want the best shots of Fireworks near the Brooklyn Bridge you likely have to get to the Brooklyn Heights Promenande Good luck on that and lastly most of the spots in brooklyn and Queens are partially blocked so you have to go to FDR drive  which is a bit of a walk from the nearest Subway    I went to the Jones Beach fireworks on Long Island istead. It is a very large show (Not as large as Macys and you cant see the fireworks offf the Brooklyn Bridge) however its more than good enough  epsecially given the Lack of bathrooms the forced standing and the ease to attend. The beach was PACKED and they had a live band on the Boardwalk. I actually have this event timed pefectly.. I park my car near the back of the Parking lot with it facing the beach. I can sit in the car watching the fireworks with the music on the Radio tuned in to the station . And after wards I was home in 45 mins the macys show would have taken much longer to get home without a bathroom whcih JOnes Beach had plenty and I was able to sit in the car with a perfect unblocked view of the fireworks. There was a band Playing on the packed Boardwalk. there were easily 100000 people watching the fireworks there This was not a failure like the earlier part of the day. ,Queenstravelbuff,New York City,New York City

Hello . Myself my wife and our two kids are planning a trip from London to New York for a few nights (April 2024) and then flying to Costa Rica for 10 nights .    We will then fly back to New York for two nights and then back home to London .    My questions are :    a) do we just need ESTA‚Äôs as we are uk citizens or do we need to do something extra as we will be going to Costa Rica and the back to New York?    b) are the immigration checks more long winded when coming in to the U.S from Costa Rica than from London ?

My friend and I will be in Baltimore in August for a conference. There is one day that we have open and we were thinking about doing a day trip to NYC. We were thinking of taking the Amtrak early in the morning and then utilizing a hop on/off bus. We only want to see a few attractions such as the One World Observatory 9/11 Memorial Times Square and Statue of Liberty. Does this sound doable or are we deluding ourselves? If it's possible any recommendations on hop on/off tours. ,SmallCountryTown,New York City,"Richmond, Virginia"

Recently had another great trip to NYC with lots of help from you guys here on the forum. Figured I‚Äôd share my trip report in case that‚Äôs helpful to anyone else in the future.    I travelled in June with my 13-year-old niece. Her family doesn‚Äôt travel much so this was a relatively new experience for her. I made her take part in the planning and she ended up picking a few activities (after I ruined her hopes of a weekend solely consisting of shopping and eating pizza :) ).    We flew in on a Friday and back on a Mon so it was a quick trip. But we still managed to fit a lot in and it was a great introduction to the city for my niece without being too overwhelming of a ‚Äòbig trip‚Äô away from home.    I‚Äôm always excessively wordy so I‚Äôll post each day as it‚Äôs own comment so that this doesn‚Äôt turn into a huge block of text.    You can see my original plan here: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k14391309-Long_weekend_itinerary_with_teen_suggestions-New_York_City_New_York.html ,Jennifer R,New York City,Kansas
Hi    We are a family of four adults travelling in January 2024 (likely 20-26).    I have been trying to narrow down options for accommodation but I am getting so overwhelmed with the options and need help with any suggestions people might have.    Our requirements  - must have at least a microwave in room to prepare simple meal if needed (one person with dietary requirements so want this option if we get stuck)  - we can manage with two double beds but would be great if we had 2 queens or even better one dble/queen and two single  - will be visiting to see broadway shows so would like somewhere within walking distance that is safe to return to at night  - when we leave we are leaving on the amtrak from moynihan so easy access there would be good however if not can uber  - would also like near to a subway station for ease of getting around to other tourist locations    As for Budget... lets just say the less we spend on accommodation the more we spend on adventures however we want to stay somewhere decent/clean. Id love to stick to the under 300USD but I'm not sure if that's reasonable    Any input appreciated  Thanks ,Tracey B,New York City,Wollongong...
Hi all. On our way to Niagara Falls for a day trip from CNY. We‚Äôll arrive at about 11 to the NY side.    Had planned to do Cave of the Winds Maid of the Mist and then go to the Canadian side to see the falls views and do whatever we feel like there. We are not interested in any of the more commerical or indoor stuff; just viewing the natural scenery. (Maybe the White Water Walk? Maybe Niagara Glen if we feel like it and have time)    Is there time in one day to do all this? We‚Äôll probably want to be back on the road by ~7pm.    We don‚Äôt know about time to wait in line for COTW MOTM (or Hornblower if we do that on the Canadian side instead) and crossing the border at some point. Also don‚Äôt know if it being the Fourth will add to the crowds/busyness on the NY side.    Thanks!! ,NyMomto2kids,Niagara Falls,"Syracuse, New York"
I will be arriving in JFK around 9PM on a weekday. Need to get to Midtown East.    Had a similar trip last year took JFK Airtrain and then the E train and it was a pretty scary ride (I am a New Yorker not easily scared). Did anyone take subway from the Jamaica Station station recently? Did they increase the police presence at the station?    Or should I take the LIRR to Penn Station instead? Is that better (focusing on the safety not considering all the other issues like time & cost)? ,NYC Java Man,New York City,"New York City, New..."

I‚Äôm obsessed with the food chain Hillstones and have been to the NYC ones a few times over the years. I know one has permanently closed now but the other one of Park Ave is still very much open I believe.    Is there any other restaurant similar to Hillstones in NYC that has the same great quality food and vibe that also have some live music as well?

I thought I would try and do a report / updates as we go along this time rather than trying to remember when we got back.    Finally after 3 attempts to return since our last trip in March 2018 we are finally back in the city. Our last trip ended up being only 2 1/2 days after our flight was cancelled due to impending snow storms. We then booked for Christmas 2020 which for obvious reasons never happened and then 2021 subsequently cancelled again.    So finally June 23 we my Husband and I are finally back. We arrived at JFK yesterday around 5 30pm and luckily no queue at security so from disembarking the aircraft to getting into our prebooked transfer took around 35 mins after waiting a short time for our luggage.    This time we are staying at the Conrad Downtown. Our driver took us on the route that meant we drove over Brooklyn Bridge to see the city again on approach was so exciting.    We quickly checked in and dumped our bags in the room which were were happy with ...Great view of the Hudson and the Colgate clock across the river. A quick refresh and we were out the door again as we needed to stay awake a few more hours to beat the jetlag.    We walked along the promenade towards Brookfield Place. It was a balmy and humid night but vibrant with families out with their children playing in the parks. We carried on down to the bottom of Battery Park as the evening began to draw in..We continued on and walked past the memorial pools which are closed off in the evening and saw the Oculus and WTC brightly lit up for Pride Month. At this point we were getting tired it would have been nearly 1.30 am UK time so we headed to a local supermarket for water and provisions for the room and made our way back to the hotel.  In the lift back at the hotel we shared with another family whose little daughter insisted on pressing our floor number..she looked at my husband and asked why he crayoned his arm (he had a tattoo) which made us laugh although especially when she said she had crayons in her room ..mum looked panicked.    So good to be back. I will write more about our first day later...this time we have no itinerary we are just going to wake up and see where the day takes us based on the weather.. although according to weather app today was rain and thunderstorms so I've carried an umbrella around all day in 30 degree sunshine .... ,AlfieMoomin,New York City,United Kingdom

So I am spending a few days in Montreal and the bakery guy asked me where I was from. When I told him NYC he told he was going to visit this summer and asked Do you have any good beaches? So of course I told him about the public ones I know on Long Island but I thought to myself that there must be many people visiting this summer who have no idea how beautiful and accessible the ocean beaches are in the NYC area some of which are reachable by public transport. I'm no expert on the public transport way to get to the ocean having driven there all my life but I can think of a few that can be reached by train or ferry:    Long Beach by LIRR    Coney Island by subway    Rockaway by NYC Ferry (or subway)    So especially for you visitors who have never swam in a great ocean beach and didn't realize what is available I'll start you with those three. ,R C,New York City,"Delmar, New York"

Hi all I have a bit of an odd question. I‚Äôve been researching locations and activities but I often notice the appeal of New York from what I understand is wandering the neighbourhoods/districts and soaking in the atmosphere visiting local stores trying random cafes and restaurants etc. That sounds ideal but slightly harder to organise.    So I thought I could breakdown my 6-7 days into neighbourhoods. I wondered though which neighbourhoods/districts require a full day and which could I pair per day not just because of proximity but because of vibe/atmosphere? I‚Äôll slot in some tourist activities as and when I can but that‚Äôs not really my priority.    Sorry for the odd question - it‚Äôs one I couldn‚Äôt quite google (unlike my other questions). If it is a bit of a chore please feel free to ignore! ,Adam C,New York City,
The Mr. and I need a hotel for one night near JFK at the end of August. He has a slew of IHG points so I have considered the Holiday Inn Express: Jamaica - JFK AirTrain - NYC.    Would this be convenient to get back and forth to/from JFK? Is it near any restaurants?    I'm also considering the TWA Hotel. I have always wanted to check it out and it's definitely convenient but it's kind of pricey - especially when you consider the HIE is free.    Or... is there a better option?

How is this not sold out every night. Or in our case yesterday afternoon hows the entire audience slightly larger than the cast. I wasnt expecting much from such an accessible off Broadway show but this was more entertaining than much bigger production Broadway shows. Company comes to mind.    The cast was great for the most part. The main characters really great. It was witty fast paced riot that had us grinning for over 90% of the time. You kinda have not much of a choice but be polite with such a small audience but it was a legit grin. Highly recommend! ,ziggy60,New York City,"New York City, New..."

Hi    Need suggestion.  I would arrive at Niagara Falls US side from Boston in the morning and leave in the evening (10.00pm).  Thus I will put my luggage at Bounce located at Niagara Gorge Discovery Center Parking Spot.    My query are:  1. Is the Bounce option correct (near US Niagara Falls attractions i.e Maid of the Mist and Cave of the Winds)?  2. After storing my luggage in Bounce in the middle of the day can I go to my luggage to pick up some clothes and then put it away again?  2. Can I buy the tickets of Maid of the Mist and Cave of the Winds there (not in advance/online)?  3. Where to buy those tickets is it in Niagara Visitor Center? OR at each of their ticket booths?    Many thanks in advance  Ika ,Ika_Rismayanti,Niagara Falls,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Husband and I will be in the area 8/24-8/29 with a rental car and an AirBnB reservation and given the possibility of poor air quality or unpleasant weather (we're San Francisco Bay Area weather wimps) we are looking for suggestions for INDOOR activities as a backup to our outdoor activities of hiking farm visits and sightseeing. Anything from Poughkeepsie up to Albany east and west of the Hudson River and around the Catskills. Thanks! ,cabowithkids,Catskill Region,"Alameda, California"

Because time is limited and we only get two days to enjoy the beauty of the Finger Lakes we were hoping to hone in on the best lake for SUPing and near awesome hikes and don‚Äôt leave out the fantastic food. Any thoughts on the perfect location for this quick getaway? Many thanks for helping with the journey! ,Caligirl,Finger Lakes,

Hello  I am planning to take my wife and 2 young girls aged 4 and 7 to both Intrepid Museum and Circle line Cruise around Manhattan on the same day as they are located beside each other.  I will be using the New York Pass by Go City if that matters.  The cruise operates 10am 12pm 130pm 330pm. The museum is open 10-5  Both attractions warn of potential long line ups. This will be the first week of August.  To avoid long lineups any advice should I do the 10am cruise or the 3:30 cruise to still allow time at museum? It is a 2.5 hour cruise. Or am I better trying to do these on separate days.  Thanks! ,barqs,New York City,"Toronto, Canada"
My husband and I (2 seniors) will be in NYC from September 19th to the 22nd 2023. I have been looking at hotels sadly staying in Manhattan is totally out of our budget. I looked at hotels in Long Island City and the ones we liked are also very expensive. I found a very nice and affordable Holiday Inn in Woodside Queens. I realized of course that it will be much further than Long Island City however the train station is about two blocks away.  Should I also be looking into hotels in New Jersey and if so what areas are close to Manhattan? What is the best and easiest way to get to Manhattan from NJ.    Your help is greatly appreciated. ,Myra P,New York City,

Ok guys here's a tricky one. I want to send a gift from Portugal to a friend in Manhattan but I don't want her to pay any taxes or customs fees. I was thinking I could send the parcel to a delivery company in NY they would take care of everything (e.g. any payments) and then deliver it to my friend. I recently contacted a company called Fly Over The City but I'm not entirely sure they do these international deliveries. Any tips? ,Flavio S,New York City,"Madeira, Portugal"
Hi can I please get some feedback on the 42 Hotel in Williamsburg Brooklyn. It only has one review on Tripadvisor and I do appreciate that maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs new or has recently changed hands but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs a no no. Will it be relatively easy to travel back and forth to Manhattan? I‚Äôve only ever stayed in Manhattan but this is so much cheaper and my granddaughter goes free so makes a huge difference. Thank you ,Julie W,New York City,"Cardiff, United..."
I was going to attend a court session on August 3 but the first week is not possible for me. Do you know if NYC courts are open in August? Thanks! ,Flavio S,New York City,"Madeira, Portugal"
This TR is a little different since we've been to NYC a few times so weren't really looking to do the top tourist sites and also we stayed with our kid in Williamsburg Brooklyn so didn't have to look at hotels. We rode the subway almost everywhere I'm sure we got our money's worth out of our 7-day Metro pass. The weather was hot and so humid it made it tough but we barely got rained on at all so that was lucky (rain was predicted every day).    Wed - flew in late (after 10 pm) and sat on the tarmac for an hour. JFK seems to have issues. Had to wait in line for a taxi but only 10 minutes or so. With tip taxi JFK to Williamsburg was about $90.    Thurs - Breakfast at Sunday In Brooklyn. The breakfast sandwich was just OK and IMHO overpriced. Maybe it was just an off day. Next we got our Metro cards at the machine in the subway station it was very easy. Then we headed to the 9/11 Museum. We'd purchased our tickets online while at the restaurant so we skipped the line and went right in. There are some incredible artifacts in there. For me it was overwhelming. I definitely recommend it but it's so very heavy. Onward. Not much time for dinner so we took out from L'Industrie pizza which was tasty. Capping off the day with Funny Girl at the August Wilson Theater. This was with the alternate lead Julie Benko who was fantastic.    Fri - Into the city. Planned to eat Ess-a-Bagel but the line was a block long so over to Black Seed Bagels at 30 Rock. The bagels were fine but the order took forever. I think a lot of restaurants these days are filling door dash orders while walk-in customers wait. Next stop Christie‚Äôs auction house - people probably don't realize that you can walk right in and view their current auction exhibit for free. They're currently showing the Donna Summer collection. It was more interesting than I expected! (Our kid's friend works there so that made it extra cool.) Next we visited our kid's office nearby. It has great views all around so that checked our city view checkbox. Then we walked through Central Park to the Guggenheim to behold some modern art. Dinner was at Pheasant in Brooklyn which was quite good but turns out it was their last weekend they are now closed. On the way home we took out from Levain Bakery in Williamsburg. At first I was like $5 for a cookie what? But somehow these things are bigger than they look and they are good! Worth it.    Sat - We walked around the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Lovely but it was so hot and humid. We got some lemonade or something at the cafe there and gave our feet a little break by taking an Uber over to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. Fairly short walk with great view of the city. And that puts you basically in Dumbo. We were very hungry and it was drizzling a bit so we grabbed a bite at Shake Shack. Then made our way to the bridge view and down to the ferry which we rode to Smorgasburg. I highly recommend this day's itinerary it worked out great.    Sun - We have family north of the city so we took the train from Grand Central. Tip: sit on the west side of the train for lovely views of the Hudson River. (I.e. the left side heading north.) Oh and we tried the whispering gallery at Grand Central it works if you find the right spot. Walking home we hit up one of those falafel trucks you see all over town. It was not bad!    Mon - Take out from Have A Bagel. Big bagels very good. And take out coffee from PPL very tasty and cute little shop. Ready for the day we started at The Vessel then walked the High Line down to Chelsea Market. We poked around the shops and waited in line for Los Tacos No. 1. Totally worth it. Delicious and not expensive. Walked a little further to Little Island a nifty spot to gaze at Jersey City. Capped the day off with happy hour at Roey‚Äôs and a creme brulee at Petit Boucherie. The kids stayed out later and came home with a bodega chopped cheese pretty dang good.    Tues - luckily our flight was only delayed an hour some folks were delayed 5 hours or more! Nice to be home.    Thanks to all who post here -- I have gleaned a lot of great info so wanted to add my small contribution. ,Tom F,New York City,"Portland, Oregon"
We‚Äôre heading to NYC next week for my dads belated 60th.    As a fan of the Warriors film he really wants to stand outside Stillwell Ave and we want to go round coney island.    I‚Äôve done a search about transport on here to coney island and the most recent post was 2022 so wanted to check if it‚Äôs updated.    We had read a ferry service was launching from Pier 11 but that has now been pulled.    I‚Äôm based in the UK and appreciate each country has their own ways of scheduling transport etc. so I was just making sure I‚Äôve understood everything correctly and nothing is lost in translation    We are staying on 32nd street and believe our nearest station would be Herald Sq on 35th?    Would we need the ‚ÄúD‚Äù line and can access either the ‚ÄúF‚Äù ‚ÄúN‚Äù or ‚ÄúQ‚Äù subway train to coney island?    I‚Äôve tried to read the schedules on MTA but honestly I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm reading it correctly.    If the above is correct am I right in thinking that there‚Äôs a subway train every 8-10mins and the last train is around midnight? (Not that we intend to stay that late/long)    Google says it‚Äôs 30mins in a cab but have read it‚Äôs stupid expensive in a cab.    Very happy to be schooled on this one. Haven‚Äôt taken the subway in NYC in about 5years so just wanted to check.    TIA    Happy Travels!  Mango :0) ,Mango26,New York City,"Liverpool, United..."

Have to admit- I'm a big Seinfeld fan and would like to try a black & white.  Reviews online suggest the William Greenberg Desserts on 59thSt (not the one on Broadway.)  Any other suggestions welcome! ,Centralvic,New York City,"Ballarat, Australia"
How to stay in midtown New York City for only $281/night:    Staying in the heart of NYC ain't for the financial faint of heart my friend though with a little foresight and an adventurous spirit you can rent a hotel room that is merely expensive.    After inputing the dates of my stay (Jun 7-13) booking.com returned numerous options ranging from $252/night for a bunk bed with shared bathroom at Pod 51 to $3750/night at the Whitney Hotel. The idea of staying in a pod intrigued me almost as much as paying $252/night but sharing a bathroom did not. I did find though that by paying $29 more a night at Pod 39 I could get a bathroom all my own.

Leaving for New York City tomorrow. Will be living with my family at the Hyatt place in Chelsea. Will have unlimited subway pass. What are the best places to eat not necessarily expensive but typically New York and excellent and memorable? Thanks. ,pvel1,New York City,"Jonesboro, Arkansas"
