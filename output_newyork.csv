Just double checking paperwork for our trip starting tomorrow and have totally boobed with bookings for the 23rd Dec!    Have the Rockettes Christmas show at Radio City at 4pm and The Nutcracker with New York City Ballet at the Lincoln Center at 8pm...................    Can't change the ballet tickets at all I've found and the Rockettes were booked through Ticketmaster with a hefty admin fee and worse seats are now about a 100$ more per ticket and heaven knows what they'd charge us for admin then so decided we'll do both if we can.    I think it will be possible to do both but obviously I'm not a local and don't know for sure. Does anyone know what time the Rockettes etc finish and if we then have time to get to the Lincoln Centre (and how) to be seated for their start time of 8pm?    As you can imagine I'm in trouble with my husband who is trying to be understanding but then remembering what he paid for the tickets - oops! Would appreciate any advice please ,lovesusa,New York City,Stockton Heath...
Since i am staying only 3 days which marshal store is the largest to go for as there many ? ,Mohamed F,New York City,"Cairo, Egypt"
Hi All    First time positng here.    This is a late family getaway trip so has not been best planned.    We are a family of 5 (2 x Adults and 3 x Chiuldren 15 12 & 10).    This will be our first time in New York and we have flights on hold for JFK landing 26/12/23 and leaving NVY 04/01/24.    Manhattan is quite expensive I have noticed in temrs of hotel costs so i just wanted to know are there any other locations that we can consider beside Manhattan? We can use public transport to get in and out of the city?    The length of stay is purely because we dont want to rush our visit and get to take in everythng we can.    Any help much apprecaited  Sanj ,spacerider666,New York City,"London, United..."
I'm planning a 1 night (yes I know!) visit to the falls in late sept. Can anyone comment on the best view hotel please? My budget is to upper 3 figures so I can pick a high floor with a view but....I'd like to take photos not through a window (I guess hotel windows don't generally open) so it's more important that I could have some kind of high viewing platform if possible. Does this exist? As another question then where is the best ground access viewpoint on the Canadian side for photos of the falls?  Many thanks for your reply Brian. ,bfrost666,Niagara Falls,"Exmouth, United..."
Does 7 day fare cap work also on international credit cards? How will I know that I reached the cap and that credit card is not getting charged anymore? ,Marko H,New York City,"Solkan, Slovenia"
There seem to be a few options for NYC food walking tours. We’d love to try one in late September that goes to Chinatown and Little Italy if possible. We’re staying near Times Square but are willing to start anywhere.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions. ,nancy c,New York City,toronto
