I will be travelling with my family (mehusband and 2 teenager's who loves Japan and anime).If can i would like to add Hokkaido just to visit Sapporo if can.    Part of my plans includes overlooking the scenery while travelling by the trains.    A few questions:    1. I will be travelling to/from Singapore so which direction should I travel? From Osaka-Kyoto-Tokyo or Tokyo - Osaka - Kyoto    2. How is this allocation: How many nights do we need for each place?    3. What are the transportation i should take and regarding the JR Pass which type i should get?    4. Are there any other cities I should visit? Is there time?    Thanks guys appreciate the help. ,MAAYA,,
Hello I read that 7 Bank (at 7/11 stores) were the best but noticed they were going to charge 3.5% conversion fee.    Is this the same with all ATMs? The other good ATM option I read about was the Post office ATMs. Would these be better or is there another ATM you would recommend?    I'm using an Australian Ubank Visa debit card that doesn't charge overseas transactions or exchange fees. thanks. ,The_Vedas,,"Sydney, Australia"
Our hotel in Takadanobaba doesn’t arrange luggage forwarding to our next destination.  I’m trying to avoid taking suitcases on a 7.30am Tozai line to Otemachi Station and then walking across to Shinkansen at Tokyo station.  We’ve found a local 7-11 that seems to be able to do it although the discussion about it was a little hesitant/confused. I guess our only concern then is about the reliability of using the service through a 7-11 as opposed to having a hotel arrange it which they can’t do anyhow.  Should this be a concern or are we better to tackle the Tozai Line with medium sized luggage at around 7.30am?  Thanks! ,Renee1901,,

We have been here for three weeks and visited Azabudai Hills twice. The Christmas Market is beautiful and tons of ornaments and decorations for sale. Also they have food stalls and it is so nice. A hidden gem is the observation deck on the 33rd floor in the tallest building in Japan-the Mori Tower. I don't know how much longer this observation floor will be free but for now it is free and steady traffic but not overflowing. Thank you Japan for a beautiful three weeks and to all of you who help on the daily with Japan questions! ,DallasFashionista,,"Dallas, Texas"

Hello    I'm leaving Tokyo and headed to Narita Airport and was interested in taking the Keisei Skyliner from Keisei Ueno Station but was a bit confused on how to get on the train. From the website and reading on the subject it seems I can use an IC card (Suica or Pasmo) to pay for the whole trip and just tap in and out.    But I also saw mention of a separate ticket which is a base fare plus reserved seats. Do I need to buy reserved tickets in advance? Can I buy it at the station? Do the seats need to be reserved or can I just sit at any seats that are available. Lastly is there room for big pieces of luggage? Thank you in advance. ,theGr81oNe,Tokyo,United States
We are traveling with a group to Japan in March. Our group trip will conclude with train travel from Hiroshima to KIX on April 11th.    However because of cheaper flight arrangements we will have two additional days. We already have flights booked out of KIX on April 14th to fly home.    We will be transiting through Osaka as we make our way from Hiroshima to KIX. How do we travel from the train station to the town of Osaka? Where do we stay in Osaka? What do we do for two days in Osaka. This will be at the very end of a busy three week trip; thus nothing too highly energetic. How far from Osaka back to KIX to fly home?    Thank you! ,claireellyn,,"graham, texas"
I have made online purchase from JR Bus 2 tickets from Gotemba Premium Outlet to Shinjuku Express Bus Terminal and the JR Bus company sent an email confirming my reservation with a link to retrieve my Expressway Bus Net Web Boarding Pass.

Hi! We will be traveling to Tokyo Kyoto Hiroshima and back to Tokyo over the last two weeks in March. It’s slightly more economical to purchase individual tickets instead of the JR Pass but I’m wondering if it would make sense to buy the pass anyway so we can prebook our trains and have seat reservations. There are 6 of us and we’d like to sit together and I definitely want to be able to sit down. If we wait and purchase the tickets once we are in Japan do you think we will be able to get seats together? Will we be able to pick and choose the train schedule we want? Or will the trains be packed or sell out? Thanks for your help! ,Kerri M,,"Goleta, California"

We have enough Bonvoy points for a two night stay at either of these hotels (tentatively planned for late Spring 2024). We don't have status with Bonvoy so we'll most certainly be given the most basic room. We typically travel on a budget so this will be a great opportunity for us to stay at a place that we could never pay out of pocket for. We've visited Kyoto before so we're familiar with both locations/areas. I'm sure that we can't go wrong with either hotel but I'd like to hear from fellow travelers who have stayed at one or both of these places. Which would you choose (and why)? ,jt108,Kinki,"Davis, CA"
We will be in Tokyo for New Year’s Day. I realize a lot of places will be closed and I know it is tradition to visit the shrines on the first day of the year.    We will likely try to avoid the shrines then to avoid the crowds. What is your suggestion for our itinerary on Jan 1? TeamLab happens to be open on this day so we have tickets for 10am.

Hi! I'm coming to Hakuba in February. We're not planning to drive and we booked a place that's a 10-15min walk from the main street in Echoland.    My question is if we intend to walk around Echoland for dinner after a day on the slopes how do we deal with our skis/snowboards?    We could bring it back to our accommodation before coming out for dinner but that's a 20-30 minute round trip walk (and maybe more if we wait for the buses). Is it customary for people to leave their ski equipment outside the shop if you're inside buying stuff/eating?    In some countries I've also observed people chain up their skis/snowboards to the open-air racks at the base of the slopes in ski resorts and coke back to retrieve them the next day. Obviously there's a small risk of theft here but is this allowed?    Thanks! ,yeethan,Hakuba-mura,
Hi We will most appreciate some advice for some bracketed queries below when planning the following itinerary. I still have 6 extra days which I am not sure where should I develop the plan?    Day 1  Pickup car & drive out of Tokyo by 9.30am  Open-air Museum  [Please recommend an inexpensive and clean or new hakone hotel for 2N- how about Villa Hakone Stage?]    Day 2  Cable Car and Ropeway to Owakudani (great boiling valley) try black eggs + GeoMuseum  Take ropeway down to Togendai to take pirate ship cruise across Lake Aishi to Hakonemachi-ko  Lunch at Tatsumi 69 Hakone Ashigarashimo District Kanagawa 250-0521 Japan  Walk to Hakone Checkpoint  Amazake-chaya Tea House?  Hakone Shrine?  [Staying at Villa Hakone Stage may help solve the car issue. Otherwise if I stay at another hakone hotel I do not know how to collect the car from Gora station at the end of the day?    Day 3  Check out & drive to Mount Fuji  Fuji Safari Park  [Japan should be quite safe without any car breaking incident if I drive straight to Fuji Safari without dropping the luggage at the fuji hotel?]  [Please recommend an inexpensive and clean or new fuji hotel?]    Day 4  Fuji Q highlands    Day 5  Narusawa Ice Cave  Fugaku Wind Cave  Aokigahara Forest  Saiko Iyashi-no-Sato Nenba (Traditional Japanese Village)    Day 6  Momiji Tunnel [not sure if I should go arakurayama first or Momiji tunnel in the morning or evening?]  Kawaguchiko Music Forest Museum  Arakurayama Sengen Park ,san20sg,Tokyo,Singapore

Hi - first time to Hakuba (staying at Hotel Goryukan) for one adult and two children (14 and 17) from 21 December. We are considering two travelling options from Tokyo :  1) direct train from Shinjuku to Hakuba by Azusa then use taxi in Hakuba for travelling:  2) train to Nagano station then rent car and drive to and within Hakuba    I have only driven in snow condition for a 7-day ski trip within Niseki ski area (all short distance) and find driving slowly would generally be ok. But when snowing heavily it can be difficult as cannot see the road ver clear. On the other hand it seems not easy to book taxi in Hakuba but we do not want to rely on shuttle bus. Any experience sharing on during from Nagano station to Hakuba and also booking taxi in Hakuba is highly appreciated. Thanks a lot! ,MTeh,Hakuba-mura,"Hong Kong, China"
Hi - we are trying to find out if it is feasible to have same day travel from HAKUBA to Narita airport for the afternoon flght on the same day. Our alternative is to leave a day earlier (23) and stay in Tokyo for one night. Looking on Google map we should be able to work out as:  1) 8:20am Aplico bus from HAKUBA to Nagano  2) 9:58 Shinkansen from Nagano to Tokyo station  3) tokyo station to NRT arriving before 1pm.    I check with my hotel front desk but they are not sure about the feasibility of this route. (In Niseko this is a common way to travel by bus then flight on same day).    So a few questions :    1) are the bus punctual? Or the route may take longer than 1.5 hours;  2) seems like the morning bus cannot be reserved in advance. Is that right?  3) Would the 8am bus be easily full so we should arrive bus station? As I thought may not many people take it if it’s not common route to fly out from tokyo on same day.  4) should we reserve Shinkansen in advance or only when we arrive the station? We are not sure at this timing if the train is popular so advance booking is needed. I saw a post saying that usually there were over 200 non-reserved seats available.    If anyone has done similar route please advise. Thanks a lot! ,MTeh,Hakuba-mura,"Hong Kong, China"
I have been lucky enough to visit Japan 4 times over the last decade. (Once in late May once for Cherry blossom twice in Autumn). I have been to Tokyo Kyoto Osaka Kanazawa and Kawaguchiko.  I am looking to travel in winter not to ski for sightseeing. I am keen to travel in mild snowy conditions but not the really cold temperatures of Tohoku or Hokkaido. I was thinking January 25?  Leaving from Tokyo I would like to visit these places on a 10-12 day trip:  Takayama  Shirawakawa - go  Matsumoto (base)  Nagano - Snow monkeys - Jigokudani Yaen Koen  Fujiyoshida  Kanagawa    I think it might be too cold for Shizuoka?    Can anyone suggest an itinerary that is suited to train travel? I can catch a bus if absolutely necessary. I am open to alternate destinations.    Thank you  Kate ,Kate B,,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi  I am planning a trip to Japan this October and was wondering if someone could take a look at my planned intinery and tell me if it is possible to travel to all of these places without renting a car?  I am a bit worried about getting to Takamaya from Tokyo and was wondering if there are any direct bus routes that go there?  The train seems a bit complicated with quite a few stops and changes and we will be travelling with luggage so the bus may be a better option.

I am really struggling to figure out the best way to travel - either renting a car or using a train. There will be five of us so it does seem that a car might be more flexible less time consuming and less expensive. Here's our plan - would love some advice!    Day 1: Travel from Tokyo to Hakone - sightsee and spend the night in Hakone  Day 2: Travel directly to hotel or train to Minobu and shuttle to hotel: We are staying the night at Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan  Day 3: Travel to Kyoto (spending several nights)    One thought I have is to rent a car in Tokyo & drop car in Shizuoka on day 3 then take the train into Kyoto. But really unsure at this point! ,melanie j,Kanagawa Prefecture,"Ada, Michigan"

Hi all    We are a group consisting of two couples coming to Japan next May and we have an overnight allocated to Hiroshima / Miyajima.    My question is if we have an overnight where should we use it?    We will be travelling from Kyoto having spent a few days there and will then travel back to Kyoto for an additional few days. We intend to do the obvious sights in Hiroshima and would like to visit Miyajima also being within reach.    Where should we stay and why?    Any recommendations for options on accommodation would be useful too to compare against searches already done. Our budget would maybe extend to 45000 / 55000 per room per night if possible.

Hello    We are passing by Japan and taking a stop-over of 3 days to get glimpse of few places. Being so short of time and still want to see some places I am getting confused what region should I focus. I can get rental car if that would make sense or immediately after landing in HND I an get on fast train and ride far.  We are two adults with one 8 years old.  Days : I will reach at 6 AM at HND on day-1. Coming in business seat so I guess I will get some sleep on flight. On day-4 at 6 PM have to fly out so I guess I should be at HND at around 2 PM.  Interests : I am interested in photography scenery landscape architecture (but we are not heavy on history). Most picture of Tokyo I am seeing are of modern city. I guess I will move out to see some scenery outside of big cities.  We have less than 4 full days. Though short time but would like to see more. If we have to see one region and then get on fast train for other region it is fine with us.  Options I seen so far : I have been reading and Kyoto looks like favorite of many based on our interests. Hokkaido is another place for natural scenery. But I am also reading fast trains can take us anywhere in 3 4 5 hours so I wouldn't want to restrict ourselves because some places are far.    With so many options I am overwhelmed and looking for your guidance I should start with what options.  This is for April last week. I am posting it in Tokyo forum as I will start and do trip from here. Please let me know if posting in other region should make more sense.  Please suggest.    Thanks ,trvlr1010,Tokyo,Washington

Hi guys my husband and I will be visiting Tokyo in January and we are thinking of taking a 2 nights trip to Hakone from Tokyo and then from Hakone we will drive to Tokyo Disneyland area to spend a couple of nights before returning back to Tokyo to catch our flight home a few days later.    We are thinking of renting a car to drive around in Hakone After 2 nights in Hakone we will then drive to our accommodation in Tokyo Disneyland area where we will spend a couple of days visiting the Disney parks. Thereafter we will go back to Tokyo to spend a few more days before going home.    May I know where would be the best place to rent a car in Hakone? I understand that it is better to take a train out of Tokyo first. Would it be possible to store our big luggages in the Tokyo hotel until we return 4 nights later? So that we don't need to take up space in the train with our luggages.    Also would it be possible to drop off the rental car at Tokyo Disneyland area as we understand traffic can be heavy in the Tokyo central area and we don't wish to contend with the heavy traffic.

I have managed to sign up for an eki-net account and linked my Suica card (from my previous trip).    Am I right to say that now I just need to click accordingly and pay with my credit card?  I can purchase 4 tickets with 1 linked suica card how does it works on the day when I use it? I understand that it is an e-ticket.    Also anything I need to take note of before purchase? ,randomtraveler56,Tokyo,

I will be getting my Takayama Hokuriku pass from KLOOK so I will not have my pass until I reach Japan.    I have seen online that Nohi Bus Centre might ask for Pass number to reserve a seat when you call them. Is this True?    Does anyone have any recent experience booking the Nohi bus to Shirakawa Go using the Takayama Hokuriku pass that they can share here?    Thank you for your help. ,Olivia L,Takayama,
Hi! We're planning our second trip to Japan and this time we'll have our 2.5-year-old and 5-year-old daughters with us. We have 2 weeks: last week of March and first week of April.    On our first trip to Japan (pre-kids!) we explored most of the popular destinations of central Honshu including Tokyo Kamakura Hakone Nikko Kyoto Nara Koyasan Himeji Miyajima Shirakawa-go and Kanazawa. We'd prefer to explore new places on this trip.    Our young kids are pretty good international travelers. We’re hoping to expose them to Japanese culture (ryokans temples shrines food customs etc.). We do NOT plan to go to any theme parks and they are not interested in manga anime etc. or many of the common destinations listed on Japan with kids guides. We are looking for destinations that WE will enjoy that are also kid-friendly and will expose them to all the beauty of Japanese culture. We can weave in some kid-centric activities like playgrounds or fun food each day.    We know we won’t be able to move quite as fast as we did without kids! The toddler still needs an afternoon nap and they don’t have the stamina to walk all day. We’re hoping for maybe 3-4 places to stay and we can take lots of day trips from there to avoid quite so much packing/un-packing with the kids. We haven't booked flights yet and can fly direct into either Tokyo or Osaka potentially flying into one and returning from the other. We plan to travel by train to avoid needing car seats (and plus kids love trains!).    Here are some of the areas we're considering:  1. Shikoku: Perhaps use Takamatsu as a base? I'm interested in Naoshima and Teshima Kotohira and Iya Valley. Perhaps we could explore more of Shikoku to include Ehime and Kochi areas?  2. Areas on Honshu near Shikoku: Kurashiki perhaps Okayama Onomichi  3. Tohoku: Some have suggested this as a good region for Sakura the first week of April. Ideas include Joetsu Kakunodate Hirosaki Aomori Lake Towada hot springs towns of Ginzan Onsen or Nyuto Onsen Dewa Sanzan Sado Island  4. Yamaguchi: Hagi Akiyoshidai / Akiyoshido  5. Izu Peninsula  6. Wakayama: Kumano Nachi Taisha  Miscellaneous destinations across Honshu: Kinosaki Onsen Adachi Museum of Art near Matsue Matsumoto Kusatsu Onsen    What we like: We love traditional Japanese culture photography and getting away from the tourist crowds. (We know this will be difficult during Sakura!) We'd love to see Sakura if the timing works but if we do we'd like to do so in areas that are far less crowded. We live in Lake Tahoe California so we get plenty of nature (mountains lakes & forests) in our everyday lives but if there are great destinations for nature PLUS Japanese culture those would be great for us. (We loved Koyasan on our first trip!)    I'd love any recommendations on the best areas to explore good home bases that we can use for several day-trips destinations that will be the best with young kids suggested itineraries or any other tips based on the information above. Thank you in advance! ,myzzCalifornia,,Lake Tahoe...

I read that only 7bank machines will accept international ATM cards. Is this true? I've been using these machines with no issue but now I would like to withdraw less than 10000 and it won't allow a transaction for less.    are there any machines in Naha accepting international cards that will let you withdraw less than 10k at a time?    Also the 7bank machines always ask me something about conversion whether it should be yen or USD. I have been choosing yen because I assumed there'd be an extra charge otherwise - is this correct?    Thanks for your help! ,sovrei,Okinawa Prefecture,Los Angeles...
Hi    My flight is arriving at KIX international at 3.40pm on a Saturday. I am planning to head to Yokohama. It seems like the best way to get there will be a domestic flight to Haneda instead of taking two trains with luggage in tow.    The domestic flight time i’m looking at is 5.35pm. It doesn’t count as a connecting flight. So would i need to pass through immigration again?    Also i am interested to pick up my luggage at the belt and forward it to Yokohama. Are there luggage forwarding counters in the departure hall assuming i won’t need to pass through immigration for my domestic flight?    Please help thank you! ,E1592,Osaka,
Hi All    I need some advice and guidance on Train tickets/passes for our family (2 adults a 12 year old (also an adult?) and a 9 year old) holiday next Spring!    The rough itinary is:    1) Arriving at Tokyo Haneda - spending approximately 4 days.  2) Bullet Train to Osaka - spending approximately 10 days.  3) Intend to get accommodation at Osaka as a base and planning various day trips to Kyoto Nara maybe Kobe Universal Studios Japan and so forth.    Due to the cost of the JR pass for my family of 4 I originally intended to get a 7 day pass commencing on the day to Osaka.    However on second thoughts I think it's more cost effective to pay for single-fares from Tokyo->Osaka and then pay daily whilst at Osaka for the individual trips - I'm estimating about 30%~ of the cost of the 7 day JR Pass.    I know tickets can be bought physically at JR Stations in advance but where is the best place to get the actual cost of the Shinkansen tickets so I can do some maths beforehand? Is Japan Transit Planner https://world.jorudan.co.jp a good accurate source?    Once I'm in Osaka I was thinking of getting daily or 3/7 day travel passes but not sure if these exists? From some Googling some posters recommend just getting a SUICA type top-up card and just tap-in and go where ever I travel - although this sounds great and removes a lot of the pre-planning is this cost-effective? Happy to pay a bit more if it removes some headache!    Thank you all! ,CS82,Osaka,"London, United..."
I am planing to do a trip of Tokyo Taiwan Hongkong and Vietnam in Jan 2024.    Trying to meet up a friend in Hokkaido for some skiing. Howeer given that I am travel light for all other legs of the journey I prefer to not pack a whole winter gears.    So my question is: is there any rental shops that will rent out winter jackets and snow pants for ski? What about the gloves goggles gaiters and even thermal layer underneath the snow pants? In another word I am looking to be outfitted by the shop for the winter sports from head to toe. Is there such a service available?    Many thanks ,Jennifer E,Hokkaido,Lowell...
Hello  Considering a 2 weeks roundtrip (train and rental car) in July/August and would like feedback. We have been to Japan 2-3 times before but never north of Tokyo. We love onsen ryokan kaiseki...  So far this is a possible itinerary - what do you think?  Saturday (27th July) arrival Tokyo airport morning. Train to Sendai/Matsushima  Sunday Matsushima  Monday Train to Yamagata (Zao)  Tuesday Zao  Wednesday Rental car (one way) to Ginzan  Thursday to Hiraizumi  Friday to Kakunodate  Saturday (3rd August) to Nyuto onsen  Sunday Nyuto  Monday to Towada-ko  Tuesday (6th August) to Aomori festival  Wednesday (7th August) Aomori festival (deliver rental car)  Thursday Train back to Tokyo airport    We were also considering starting in Aomori (6th August) then to Hakodate Noboribetsu Jozankei Sapporo Sounkyo Akanko Kushiro but the Tohoku tour seems better. Then we would leave Hokkaido for another year. What do you think - which is best?    Also - what about rain in July/August will it be a big problem? ,Mikkelrev2013,Tohoku,"Oslo, Norway"

My husband and I-71 and 70-spent a wonderful 2 weeks in Tokyo Hakone Kyoto Takayama Shirakawa-go and Kanazawa in October. We had planned to go last year but had to postpone our trip becasue the country hadn't opened for outside travel when we were scheduled to go.  We have always traveled all over on our own often with my husband driving but over the last few years as we have gotten older have found that using a tour group that schedules transportation and hotels and provides individual guides works well for us. We don't like organized tours and this method seems to provide freedom to plan our trip free time and having someone to do the work of reservations and often providing transportation for us. On this trip we traveled mostly by train and public transportation and were happy to have someone to guide us on subways and local trains. We traveled by shinkansen on our own. We scheduled some days on our own. We planned the trip with Odynovo Tours and was not quite as happy with them as with some other groups we've in other places. Their guides were wonderful though and really added to our knowledge and enjoyment. One lovely woman became an instant friend and we agreed that there was a special connection between us.    The trip started on a down note. We had flown from Boston to JFK in New York and were supposed to fly from there to Tokyo. After waiting through some delays it was announced that the Japan Airlines flight was canceled and everyone would be rebooked. We had to rush down to baggage claim and get the one suitcase we had checked and then waited on a line for 3 and a half hours until we were told that our only option was taking a flight at 10 that night to Frankfurt Germany and then to Tokyo-about 25 hours of travel. We lost a day in Tokyo and had to reschedule a lot. We arrived exhausted but after that the trip was everything we hoped for.    Our favorite hotels were 2 Japanese style hotels one with Western style beds and one with futons. The futons were surprisingly comfortable though it was a challenge getting our older bodies up in down-especially in the middle of the night! My husband enjoyed trying the onsens and we liked the relaxed atmosphere and food.    One thing that surprised us was that we had more trouble conversing in English than we expected. English was not as widespread as we were led to believe. We found that we even had trouble with people in the hotels. Though they were lovely and tried hard to help us it was often hard to understand directions and information. Sometimes they used Google Translate and that worked but a few times we had some problems come up and language became a difficulty. We sometimes had trouble navigating our way around since of course most street signs were in Japanese and using our maps didn't work well. If we were better at using things like Google Maps it would have helped but we often had trouble with this. I'm sure younger people used to using their phones to get around would do better. We found using the subways and other public transportation intimidating especially in Tokyo and Kyoto as the stations were so big and their were so many different lines. When we traveled with guides it was a great system. The shinkansen were wonderful and easy to use once we got the hang of it. When they said they'd leave at a certain time that's when the left down to the minute. When it said we'd arrive at 10:02 we arrived at 10:02. We were extremely impressed by the cleanliness-there were teams of woman cleaning every where even vacuuming the station.    All of our guides gave us little gifts along the way one nice man gave me a special little carving. The Tour company recommended giving a modest tip and I've never had a tip so appreciated. They all went out of their way to provide a great time for us and fulfilling any requests. We'd ask for restaurant recommendations for dinner and they'd recommend great places and made reservations and sometimes took us there at the end of our day together. Talking to the guides gave us wonderful insight into Japan and the culture and we had some very interesting conversations.    We had fun one night when we were walking to dinner and noticed crowds gathering along the streets. There were a lot of policemen around too. Finally a policeman blocked us from walking further. we joined the crowd and asked what was happening an it turned our the Emperor and Empress were visiting Kanazawa for the day and their motorcade was about to pass by. A lot of excitement-we joined the cheers!    We used the luggage transfer system and it worked great. At one point we sent our one larger suitcase ahead and just took a small case with enough for the 2 of us for 4 days and happily found our suitcase waiting in our new hotel room when we arrived 4 days later. Another time we sent our suitcase to our next stop.    Our itinerary worked out well-a nice mix of large cities and smaller places. Kyoto was special Our side trip to Nara and seeing the Great Buddha was a highlight. We really enjoyed the open air art museum in Hakone the castle and beautiful gardens of Kanazawa and markets in Takayama. The museum of parade floats in Takayama was surprisingly impressive. We were happy we went to the National Museum in Tokyo and enjoyed it very much. We were even lucky enough to see the top of Mt. Fuji. It was covered in clouds as expected when we stopped at the fifth station. We went to the shrine there and turned around and there was the peak! This lasted about 5 minutes and the clouds came back so we feel we were very fortunate.    The food was delicious. We often took our menu and pointed to a picture of something that looked good and were never disappointed. We ate in a mixture of restaurants including noddle shops for lunch nicer restaurants for fancier meals Chinese restaurants and even an Italian restaurant. Again we appreciated our guides recommending restaurants that they liked.    It was a wonderful experience. There are many rules of life there-we sometimes hoped that we were not doing something wrong. The people were extremely nice and friendly.    I'm happy to answer any questions. ,rataBoston,,boston

We (4-5ppl) are planning a 4 nights trip (2 nights at Shuzenji Onsen & 2 nights at Mishima).  Will catch a Shinkansen from Tokyo to Mishima then pick up a rental car near the station before heading out into the Izu Peninsula. Returning the car on day 3 to Mishima the stay for 2 nights at the FujisanMishima Tokyu Hotel. After which we will return by Shinkansen to Tokyo.  I read Mishima Station is complicated since the Shinkansen platforms are near the North Exit while the hotel bus terminals and happening spots are all south of the station. People complain we can’t do the walk within the station from north exit to south exit unless we re-enter the paid section by buying the 150yen ticket (IC Card not valid). And to be extra careful which exit we use since the walk outside of the station is on a slope and a fair bit of a detour.    My Plan  Like I mentioned above upon exiting the Shinkansen we would head for the car rental (ideally north side of Mishima Station). 3 days later upon returning to Mishima we would offload our luggage and some ppl at the hotel then return the car to the North side. Then returning to the hotel by walking through the inner passageway within the station after purchasing the walk-thru 150yen ticket. Am I on the right track up till now?  On the departure day we all enter the station via the South Exit then… Here is my question - Since we all have the Shinkansen tickets do we still need to purchase the 150yen walk-thru ticket to enter the inner passageway to get to the north side (where the Shinkansen platforms are at)? Or our Shinkansen ticket is valid for the passageway?  I see there are many car rentals on the south side while on the north side I only spot Toyota. I read Toyota is expensive? I think it is better to rent from the north side since someone mentioned the passageway only have upward escalator not downwards. Meaning if we had to lug our luggage from north to south we would need to use downwards stairs. ,Meowwww1968,Shizuoka Prefecture,Kuala Lumpur...
Hi    I have a trip in Tokyo in a week. I need a private transfer from HND to the hotel in central Tokyo.

Have worked out an itinerary for my husband and me for our first trip to Japan. We prefer staying in a place for two nights rather than one night only and constantly moving but not sure whether some of our two night stays are warranted or not.  We want to see the autumn festival in Takayama so those two days are set in stone. Every thing else is changeable.    Arrive in Tokyo late afternoon and spend 2 nights in Tokyo.  1 N Omachi to do the Tateyama-Kurobe Alpin route the next day  1 N Toyama  2 N Kanazawa  1 N Shirakawago  2 N Takayama  4 N Kyoto  1 N Hiroshima (or should it be 2 N?)  2 N Naoshima (or is 1N enough?)  2 N Okayama  3 N Oskaka  2N Koya San  2 N Nara  5 N Tokyo    Also will it work out better for us to get the 4 weeks JR pass or just pay as you go with an IC card. Have read that the cards are regional. Is there one that covers all the areas in our itinerary?

Hello!  My fiancé and I are set on Japan for our honeymoon sometime in 2024. Our plan originally was to spend maybe 4 nights in Okinawa for a laid back beach break and get married there (just us and maybe a couple of friends) and then make our way to Tokyo and stop off at Osaka and Kyoto maybe a few other places along the way once we figure out exactly what we want in our itinerary.    We wanted to go in September as that works well with our timing in getting ready and time off work but I have read that it is peak Typhoon season then and Okinawa might not be that nice calm beach choice we were thinking of if there are Typhoons going by! We can't do end of September/later it would either be early-mid september OR now we are considering end of May-First week of June. We have 14 nights for the trip has anyone been to these spots and can say whether it is a good idea to do September anyway or whether May/June would be better? We want to get temperatures like 25 degrees ideally.    Also I read that it can be quite a headache getting a marriage legalised in Japan would that be right to say and should just do the legal bits in the UK and just have a ceremony over in Japan?

Hi  Does anyone know the process when entering or if you are required to give any form of ID when checking in with tickets at WB Harry Potter studio?

According to the website they are non transferrable and non refundable given how in demand and hard it is to get tickets it seems a huge shame for them to just go to waste.    The tickets themselves have no personal details on so I was wondering if it would be possible to pass these on to someone else if anyone wanted them? I'm not looking to sell I just don't want them to go to waste.    If anyone has any info that would be super helpful.  Thanks :) ,laurentW4222DE,,"Sydney, Australia"

The tours do not seem to be running so we were thinking of going up and back ourselves on the 15th. First question is it worth it? Second is public transportation day of a stupid idea?  Any thoughts appreciated. ,W6175XSrebeccaw,,

Hello  we arrive in Osaka in evening and then have 2 full days to explore.    Is the Amazing Osaka pass (I think thats what it's called)?) worth getting. I would be using ICOCA card to get around otherwise so wondering if we see a few included sites would it pay for itself when factoring in transport?      I'm guessing Klook best option. Is e-ticket recommended? How do you activate? thx ,The_Vedas,Osaka,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi!  I have Google on how to travel from Fukuoka to Yanagawa as below & wanted to get advise if this is the best way to go about it.    Hakata Station to Tenjin-minami Station. (Nanakuma Line Local towards Hashimoto)  Tenjin-minami Station walk to Nishitetsu Fukuoka (Tenjin) Station. 15mins  Nishitetsu Fukuoka (Tenjin) Station to Nishitetsu Yanagawa Station. (Nishitetsu-Tenjin-Omuta Line Express towards Omuta) 1hr    Also i'm quite confused on the JR Pass portion. My previous trips to Japan were mainly at Tokyo area & have always bought a JR Pass. But as i read further my understanding is that there are alot of JR Pass available for different parts of Japan & as well as a Fukuoka 1 Day Pass.    My main itinerary during the start of my trip will be 3 days 2 nights in Fukuoka (Day trip to Yanagawa within) then to Hiroshima. So which JR Pass will be suited for this leg of my trip? ,Ben T,Fukuoka Prefecture,

Hello everyone!    I am visiting Japan in March for about 3 weeks and starting planning my itinerary slowly… I wanted to ask if anyone has a recommendation for a guide/driver that I book?  I don’t want to rent a car to travel between the cities (as I drive for work almost all day here) and trains might take longer sometimes.

Hi everyone  I’m planning to visit Japan (first time) and Seoul SK in March 2024 for about two weeks. Toronto to Seoul spend two nights then off to Japan. Budget is not a huge concern but I’d like to keep it tame.  I have been reading a lot of travel info about Japan and Seoul but because it’s my first time I’m a little overwhelmed. I have even considered contacting some travel company but don’t know where to start although I’d be happier if I can make my own itinerary.  I’m a city person but love to take in local non-urban culture to get a taste of the everyday life. I’d also love to experience some hotels/stays in some building with old Japanese architecture (sorry not sure if I’m able to explain it very well).  Any help and pointers by the community would be greatly appreciated 🙏 ,prettydaffodils,,"Toronto, Canada"

Our 2.5 year old will be coming with us December to Furano. I had a bit of a search online not a lot of babysitting/childcare/nanny services available I thought Furano resort was aimed at families?

Hi everyone    I'm finally fulfilling my lifelong dream to visit Okinawa and I will be staying a month on the island from Jan 2024 to Feb 2024 with no plans to visit the Japanese mainland.    Most itineraries here are catered for short stays but with a month to spend in Okinawa I was wondering what are some of the lesser known attractions I should go for other than the usual tourist attractions?    I have not planned my full itinerary yet but I plan to stay around Naha in the first week followed by a road trip in the second week to the Northern part with multiple hostel stays along the way and island-hopping around Ishigaki Miyakojima and Amami in the remaining two weeks.    Would a rental car be recommended? I understand that the cars have to be booked early but I have seen comments saying that it is easy to get around on public transport too. Other concerns also include the ease of doing laundry for tourists and if it is easy to get by with some basic Japanese.    Thank you all in advance! ,Jesper Leong,Okinawa Prefecture,

Hello!  Family of 4- we will be arriving into Narita and leaving from Kansai in just a few days. I am curious if people recommend purchasing a Welcome Suica when we arrive into Narita or if it is easier to use the Mobile Suica from the Wallet on our iphones? Just curious about the pros and cons of both. We are only staying for about 1 week so the 28 day limit is not an issue and we know to only add the amount of funds we will use since we can't get a refund. Other than those 2 are there any other things we should be aware of when comparing the 2? Thank you! ,Maria P,,"Pasadena, California"

Hi all    After many many years waiting/planning and a couple of cancelled trips I will be heading to Japan solo in May 2024. I am interested in food nature/sights and Japanese culture. I am starting in Tokyo and have 4 nights (3 full days plus an afternoon on the first day flying out on the 5th day) in Kyoto.  How can I make this trip more feasible? I essentially have 1 day (plus an afternoon) to hit a lot of the Kyoto must-see's as the other 2 days are essentially day trips.    27-31 May Kyoto (Royal Twin Hotel Hachijoguchi)    (note the order of these days will change depending how I feel/weather etc)    Day 1 -    Train to Arashiyama (bamboo forest Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Adashino Nenbutsu-ji lunch at Tenryuji Temple Shigetsu). I plan to arrive 7.30ish. May head to monkey park also depending on interest on the day (anything on this list people don't recommend?)    Train back to hotel for rest then have afternoon/evening free - either Fushimi-Inari or train to Nishiki market then walk through Higashiyama area maybe all the way to Kiyomizu-dera (arriving around 5/5:30pm to miss crowds (note I may be able to do some of this on the first afternoon)      Day 2 -    Train to Nara (mostly just have a passing interest here I imagine by now I will be getting templed out want to see Todai-ji and maybe Kasuga Taisha maybe Nakatanidou)    Train to Namba. Walk around and visit Dotombori area Kuromon Ichiba Nipponbashi Den Den Town Shin Sekai (has anyone walked all the way from Dotombori to Shin Sekai?). Train back to Kyoto      Day 3 -    Train to Kurama walk to Kibune. Flowing noodles if I can get in without much wait or another lunch on an outside deck.    Train to Fushimi sake area visit Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum.    Train to Uji Byodi-in and maybe Chazuna or else matcha dessert/tea somewhere.    (this day is not usually in the must-see in 3 days Kyoto itinerary but I really love the sound of it all so struggling to cut it).        Any general feedback is appreciated. I know this itinerary is looking very tight. I really want to experience lots of different things so can't work out what my priorities may be. I don't want to visit too many temples but want that mix of history and nature that I think I have in there along with foody goodness (hence Osaka Uji Fushimi Sake Village). ,keedm002,Kyoto,"Adelaide, Australia"
Thank you to all the destination experts that gave advice on HIroshima and Miyajima. In short this is what we did and we got the confidence to do it from reading these forum posts. We were in Kyoto when we decided to go to Hiroshima. We went to Kyoto station and the nice ticket agents found us seats together with space for reserved baggage area. We made sure to have our sandwiches and drinks on the train and it was wonderful. We arrived in Hiroshima and found the famous food at the train station. It was a food that started with the letter O. Then we took the quick 5-10 minute taxi to Hilton. We had buffet dinner and pool/jacuzzi time at the Hilton. It was heavenly as we are walking close to 20000 steps per day.    On the next day we had breakfast buffet and started our day at a leisurely pace. We arrived at Peace Park around noon. Walked around photos and visited with locals with the no nuke campaign. We then stopped at the bridge to have coffee at the Piano Bar which is also a bit historical. That is how we saw that there was a small ferry down below. The ferry was small and it was called the World Heritage Ferry. We then went to the Musuem and there was no line. Lots of kids on field trips but no line. We put all of our stuff in the lockers for 100 yen.    We noticed that it is VERY HOT all over Japan. We don't need our big coats and many days we venture out without a jacket. It's heavenly. We finally mastered how to go out sighseeing without coats and without too many big bags. Putting stuff in the locker at the Museum was great as it is very crowded and very hot!    After the Museum we went back to the bridge and we got Pizza from the cute cafe at the waters edge. We caught our ferry at 3:05 pm and arrived 4pm to Miyajima. We knew that low tide was around 4:30 pm because we asked the information desk at HIroshima station and they said to go at low tide. We got great photos of the Tori gate the deer and the cute streets. We caught the last World Heritage Ferry at 5:30pm and made it back to Hiroshima at 6:15pm. Walked back to our hotel (this was about 20 minutes) but we wanted to see the night scene. Hiroshima has beautiful Christmas lights and everyone is so nice.    The Hilton is only one year old and we almost stayed at the Sheraton. The Hilton had a great rate and if you are Hilton Honors then you get reduced rates with breakfast and free wifi.    I hope this helps someone. I never thought we would make it to HIroshima and Miyajima in one day and it was perfect! ,DallasFashionista,,"Dallas, Texas"

Hi everyone I'm trying to find some information about where the Loop 88 factory line bus stop can be found at Odori Station? I'd be using it to get to the Sapporo Beer Museum and the link to it on their website is only in Japanese.  We will be starting our day at Shiroi Koibito Park and then heading to Sapporo Beer Museum. I was planning to take the subway from Shiroi Koibito Park to Odori Station and then take the Loop 88 to Sapporo Beer Museum - would this be the best option?  Also I'm assuming Sapporo Beer would be open on 4 January. Also I see their premium tour is in Japanese only - that's ok is it any real impediment or would we still have a good experience? ,Renee1901,Hokkaido,

We are a small family group (all adults) travelling to Japan May 2024 and have most pinned down now. However after our first three nights in Tokyo (Shibuya area) and following on from having visiting various other locations we end up back at Tokyo to fly out from Haneda.    My thinking is that we are better advised staying somewhere with ease of transfer back to Haneda when we are set to leave. We also would likely visit Disney sea on these last few days as well as other points of interest we are able to fit into our limited time.    So my question is are there any specific hotels that seem like a really good choice for this? Our budget is approx 30000Y per night though happy too if it's slightly less or more.    Have checked out some already but I'd like to see opinions from people with experience to compare to my own research.    Thanks all. ,Wathatnoithe,Tokyo,"Cardiff, United..."
I am travelling to Japan in September and want to travel one-way from Kawaguchiko Station to Shinjuku Station on the Fuji Excursion train.    I understand I can book these tickets online through the JR East website however it doesn't appear these tickets can be picked up outside of the eastern part of the country. I am travelling on the Shinkansen from Kyoto via Mishima Station to Kawaguchiko and so won't be in that part of the country yet.    Is there a ticket office or vending machine at Kawaguchiko Station where I'll be able to pick these tickets for the Fuji Excursion train up? Has anyone had success getting these tickets outside of Tokyo? Any advice or experience would be great! ,Will,,

1. We used the JR rail calculator and based on our itinerary it makes sense to buy the JR rail pass. I think I need to go to JR rail website and purchase. This will send me a voucher which I then need to bring with me to exchange for the actual tickets. Is this correct?    2. Can I make a reservation for my trains before I arrive in Japan? I am concerned because we are in Japan during the winter holiday season. I would also like reserved seats because we are a family of 5 traveling with children.    3. Does the JR rail pass then get loaded onto the Smart-ex app?    4. Is it true that the Nozomi train from Tokyo to Kyoto is a surcharge on top of what I already paid for the JR rail pass? ,ektk,Tokyo,Menlo Park...
So I have been plugging away at building this itinerary through several hours of research and I am currently on the Osaka portion of the trip (December 28th below) and I can’t decide if I should scrap Osaka completely and go somewhere like kinosaki or kusatsu onsen or even explore more areas around Kyoto. What are everyone’s thoughts on this? This trip is for our honeymoon and we love exploring the lesser visited local areas whenever we travel (I can speak a little Japanese) greatly appreciate good food love tea and love nature. Is it worth taking a day to go to Osaka and maybe Arima? Or are there better options to spend this day?        Itinerary  Tokyo:  22nd- arrive in Tokyo around 6:45pm head to hotel in Meguro. Set stuff down and rest then have dinner nearby.    23rd- send luggage ahead to hotel in Hakone. Have breakfast at hotel go to a park or something and explore Tokyo a bit.

After museum go to lake ashi and maybe do some shopping after walking around lake Ashi. Go back to Ryokan relax and have dinner.    25th- have breakfast at Ryokan. leave Hakone for Kyoto.    Kyoto:  25th- arrive in Kyoto set luggage down in hotel and relax for a bit. Visit Yasaka shrine in maruyama park then kennin-Ji temple. then keep exploring the gion district (philosopher’s path?) for lunch and other food adventures. Have dinner somewhere in or near gion district.    26th- have breakfast at hotel. Leave for arashiyama bamboo forest and tenryu-ji temple (both in same area) after this go to iwatayama monkey park. You can either choose to stay in Arashiyama area or go to northern Kyoto in the afternoon to explore kinkaku-ji temple and Ryoan-ji temple. Either have lunch in Arashiyama or in northern Kyoto somewhere that has good tea. After done exploring these places have dinner at a local neighborhood away from tourists.    27th- Breakfast at hotel. Time to go to Uji.

Hi there! I am planning a Japan trip based in Tokyo in March 2024 and recently found out about the lantern festival in Tsunan and would love to go but am trying to work out the travel logistics to see whether it would be feasible. I'm travelling solo and don't drive.    It is advised by event organizers to stay locally as the festival runs later than the trains in and out of Tsunan and local hotels have booked up very fast. I found an affordable Airbnb in Tokamachi which looks like about a 15 minute drive away from Tsunan city centre.    I've seen that there is a taxi service operating in Tsunan but I would like to know how expensive and reliable taxis are and also anything I should know about that option in this area (I'm aware it's very snowy which must impact roads). I would then use trains to navigate back to Tokyo the next day.    Any relevant advice would be much appreciated :) ,Zoe M,Niigata Prefecture,
Hello    I have visited Japan 3 times (Tokyo Kyoto Osaka Hiroshima Kawaguchiko Nara Okayama Kanazawa Yokahama Shirakawago Nikko Hakone) and plan a December trip to Nagoya / Kobe with a visit to Nagano and Matsumoto. Whenever I look at top 20 Cities to see in Japan Nagano and Matusmoto are missing even though I am attracted to the Samurai history in Nagano the snow monkeys and the castle in Matsumoto to name a few. So my question is: does Nagano/Matsumoto is a worthy point for the 4th trip (I will visit it enenvually (-:) or should I hop to somewhere else en route to Nagoya. While they look very attractive to me I can't figure out why they are dropped from many recommendations.    Thank you    Ariel ,Mefisto1968,,"London, United..."

Just found out that my connecting flight from Tokyo to Nagoya is cancelled. Thinking of taking the Shinkansen but I am not keen to pre-book a fixed train slot in case of flight delay or immigration queue etc. I understand there is a train departing every 15 min from Tokyo station.    1) Would it be safe to assume that I can easily buy a ticket when I arrive at the station itself?    2) How much more expensive would it be compared to pre-book ticket (traveling in March)?    3) Are there tickets with more flexibility (“travel anytime” type)? ,Stayoshi,Nagoya,Malaysia
Just trying to get a sense what that the dining situation is like around Ikebukuro I guess close to the station.

Hello guys! Had watched a video where I saw that when you are purchasing the NEX ticket from the vending machine there's an option of 'NEX->Shinkansen'. Does this mean you can book the Shinkansen alongside the NEX tickets? Can anyone confirm?

If the flight arrive on time (6pm) am I likely to catch even the last Shinkansen to Kyoto at 9pm?

Hi  I'd like to book a one-way ticket on the Hello Kitty Shinkansen from Shin-Osaka through to Hakata/Fukuoka and the JR West site says that Discounted One-way Ticket's are available from select overseas travel agencies however i've reached out to some agencies here in the UK but they only do the Japan Rail Pass which I don't need. I just wondered if anyone has any information on agencies who provide one way tickets so I would be eligible for the discount and also does anyone know if the discount is much cheaper than just buying it at the standard price once I'm in Japan? The cost is showing as 10900 yen for that route which I assume is the full price? Thanks ,arranlee,,"Leeds, United..."
Please do not cancel your booking with JAPANICAN they will charge you a card fees even if it's within the free cancellation period. i was charged a 8-9% card fee after i cancelled my booking 2 days later(confirmed by JAPANICAN customer service). Agoda and bookings always refund what they charge if cancel within free cancellation period. i see other issue that people experienced with Japanican after travelling i will come back with update after my trip see if they charged me again for my cancelled hotel. ,Chan N,,"Singapore, Singapore"
I have been told that there are some picturesque little towns where we may find a traditional stay on Lake Biwa for one or two nights. However I have also read that a lot of the lakeside comprises quite large urban areas which we would prefer to avoid.    Scenery (blossoms of course) and interesting traditional townscapes are what we are looking for. Also some nice walking tracks which are not too difficult (we are fit seniors).    Any recommendations which are accessible using JR Pass? We will be travelling from Tokyo and then on to Kyoto.    Any suggestions will be appreciated. ,SydneyTeviot,Shiga Prefecture,Sydney
Hello  Has anyone recently have issues with JAPANICAN when cancelling a hotel booking where it stated free cancellation?    Surely to think that this accommodation search is part of Japan Tourism Board it would be trustworthy unquestionably. However I had this booking with JAPANICAN for an accommodation for September this year. The entry allows free cancellation and there was nowhere mentioning about fees or any charges will be made against the credit card at the time of booking. I went ahead to book and received the confirmation via email. The email confirmation indicated that charges will be put against the credit card account used for the at the time of booking if cancellation should take place. This is very underhanded! Why wasn't this pre-informed if it was the intent of charging cancellation fees it should be spelt out clearly.    Even if the property do not charge cancellation fees but search engine does then spell it out clearly. Now I tried to cancel the booking and it is months ahead of scheduled travel. It wouldn't allow me and asked that I contact the property owners to contact JAPANICAN. I did. They assisted to contact JAPANICAN which JAPANICAN informed that they have cancelled my booking. I checked twice over the last 48hours. Nothing was done and I got the property owner to question them. Now JAPANICAN informed the property owner that I have either provided an incorrect email or phone number. If I did provide an incorrect email I wonder how did JAPANICAN provide me the booking confirmation via email? This is very dishonest dealings for a reputable Japan Tourism Board trading company.    Have anyone encountered this issue?    Thanks ,V K,Tokyo,
Hello  IWe are arriving in Osaka KiX on 20 Dec and I've realized I haven't had time ti get any train names numbers or times for the many trips we plan to take. I know exactly what days and where we are traveling but now looking for recommendations of best ways and tools to quickly make a list of every JR bullet train that we are allowed to take to give to the JR office employee to book tickets for us in the smoothest way possible. Any tips appreciated. nthx ,The_Vedas,,"Sydney, Australia"
I was looking at train directions on Google Maps for taking the train from Haneda airport to Asakusa Station. In the screenshot below. The directions say to take the Keikyu Airport Line -- Kiekyu Main Line --- Asakusa Line. So it's blue line -- blue line -- red line but the text says to continue on the same vehicle for both transfers. My question is Google Maps correct that I need to just stay on the same train for the entire journey and there is no transfer even though they are different train lines?    https://imgur.com/a/8g1QPJF ,Rollinghill,Tokyo,

Tried 4 different cards including Revolut and was lucky another card worked led to book on JR Central for the Shinkansen. Trying to book a bus and none of the 4 work. All are registered to the UK. What is the issue with Japanese websites? It's like being being back in the 1990s... Seems i can book the bus via a convenience store in Japan 6 days before departure but already half the seats are booked for Jan 1st! So frustrating.

Hi there    Hoping for some feedback on my trip itinerary. I wanted to mix visiting the country and more rural parts by car (Nikko Takayama Kii Peninsula Nara) with having time to visit the big cities (Kyoto Tokyo). I understand it may be a little rushed with a couple long drives but overall I currently am excited for the mix. I am travelling with my wife and two girls. I also understand we are there for Golden Week so we will just have to embrace the chaos of that in the cities.    Some questions regarding my itinerary:    Is there anything glaring I am missing that would impact the feasibility of my travel plans?    Will we see Cherry blossoms anywhere?    I got snow tires do you think the mountain drive portion will be tough at all?    Is the foliage pretty green and spring like in most of these areas?    I am assuming since it's golden week I should book restaurants and trains when in Kyoto and Tokyo?    *April 18 - Arrive late afternoon and Stay in Tokyo at Airport    2 Nights in Nikko    *April 19 - Rent Car in Chiba close to airport and drive to Nikko explore Nikko including the shrines and waterfall    *April 20 explore Nikko shrines and restaurants and other activities to be determined.    3 Nights in Takayama    *April 21 - Long adventure drive from Nikko to Takayama stopping along the way probably in Matsumoto (will have to wake up super early)    *April 22-23 - Explore Takayama and surrounding area. We have a day trip planned to Shirikawa Village and were thinking of potentially circling back for a mountain hike in kamikochi although not sure if the tunnel would be open? Otherwise just enjoy the sights and food in Takayama    2 Nights in Wakayama Prefecture    *April 24 - Long adventure drive from Takayama to Shingu in Wakayama. Drive along Mie/Wakayama coast. I wanted to stop along the coast where possible the beach in Kumano city looks beautiful otherwise it's a travel day starting nice and early and enjoy the sights along the way    *April 25 - Explore Wakayama and main sights with some brief hiking along the Kumano Kodo (Nachi Falls Kumano Nachi Taisia Yunomine OnsenKumano Hongu Taishaas) as we loop inland and back north and stay in Totsukawa.    4 Nights in Kyoto    *April 26 - Medium drive north to Nara explore Nara return car (yes I know there will be a nice fee) train to Kyoto (place is close to Kyoto station    *April 27-29 - Have fun in Kyoto (We don't have specific plans in Kyoto yet but we were thinking of the usual main attractions probably skipping Osaka. We are staying in an apartment just outside the Higashiyama Ward and will make base from there.    5 Nights in Tokyo    *April 30 - Train to Tokyo (place is close to Tokyo station)    *May 1-4 - Have fun in Tokyo (We were thinking of one day at DisneySea although during golden week I am sure that will be chaos. It would also be nice to have one day visiting the Mount Fuji area perhaps in the Hakone area? Any suggestions? Beyond that we are just hoping to visit the various areas of Tokyo nothing specific planned yet. We are staying near Tokyo station near the Kanda station in a quieter area so we look forward to travelling around close to central transit.    *May 5 fly home ,christopher b,,"Edmonton, Canada"
Hello my wife and I are planning a day trip to Nikko on March 18th.    The fast train costs 3000 each way according to Japan Guide. Is it for the Limited Express?    We are looking at the Nikko pass which seems to cost 2120 + 1650 for the Limited Express.    Does it make sense to use take this pass for a day trip?    Also I am finding it really tough to look for trains costs and differentiating a normal express limited express and shinkasen on google. Where can I look where all the details can be seen? ,Prateek,Nikko,"Bengaluru, India"
I will be travelling from my hotel [Dormy Inn Premium Kanda] to Narita on a Tuesday around 1pm. I’ve looked at transportation options and since I have ample time after being kicked out of the hotel at 11am until airline check-in of 2:30pm I’ve decided to take the cheaper but slightly longer option of Ginza Line + Asakusa Line [Ginza Line from Kanda Station to Nihonbashi Station then transfer to Asakusa Line for Narita Airport].  I just need some confirmation that Kanda & Nihonbashi Stations have full escalator/elevator for me to move seamlessly. I will be travelling alone. I’ve looked at both the Kanda & Nihonbashi Stations’ layout. They both have elevators & escalators just that transfer at Nihonbashi is slightly complicated. However when I look at transfers at other stations to the Skyliner they aren’t that much simpler. Also with the Skyliner I would need to try to make it in time for my reserved train. While by taking the Ginza+Asakusa option it’s ‘free&easy’. Would welcome any feedback 🙏 ,Meowwww1968,Tokyo,Kuala Lumpur...

I'm about to head to Japan for 2.5 weeks. I have a Verizon iPhone. I want to use a combination of Verizon's Travel Pass (to make nearly daily calls to the United States) and Ubigi eSIM (to easily use Google Maps Google Translate etc. while sight seeing in areas without wifi).    My question is ... on a given day will I be able to use Ubigi eSIM (while sight seeing) without triggering Verizon's Travel Pass? That is can I turn certain settings off (e.g. cellular data) and use Ubigi eSIM and then turn certain settings on (e.g. cellular data and roaming) and use Verizon's Travel Pass?

Recently (within the last week) there were a few posts/articles describing the departure lines at KIX as long and chaotic. Some describe waits as long as 3.5 hours.    This long Reddit post from a couple days ago makes it sound like a horror show:    https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/s/EtXKXuIJjW    And others:    https://loyaltylobby.com/2023/11/22/whine-wednesday-crazy-security-lines-at-osaka-kansai-airport-with-1-5-hour-wait-periods/    https://x.com/alfonsozt/status/1726435553082761602?s=46    A post from last year suggests there are issues because KIX is being remodeled for Expo 2025.      Do international and domestic departures at Terminal 2 share the same security checkpoint? (Ie will we get stuck in the same lines as people departing internationally?)    Is Terminal 2 more or less congested than T1 on a typical day?    https://x.com/alfonsozt/status/1726435553082761602?s=46    My husband and I are flying on Peach out of KIX at 1:20pm on Monday November 27 on a domestic flight. We’re leaving our central Kyoto hotel and taking the train at 10 am to the airport and we have left ourselves 2 hours from train arrival to takeoff.    Should we change our plans and arrive at KIX earlier than plannned? If so how early should we arrive in case the lines are truly that long?    We also read that Peach Aviation has a 7kg carry-on weight limit. We have standard-sized TSA-approved roll-aboards that certainly exceed 20kg. Should we plan to check these bags for the flight (and will this add significantly to our travel time since I understand there is another line to drop off checked luggage?)

Hello Husband and I will be in Tokyo in March and was considering Citadines Central Shinjuku for our stay. I have some difficulty in walking and climbing stairs. I wanted to ask if the station exits closest to this hotel have elevator/escalators and will I have to walk a lot (more than 500-1000 m) to take any train/metro/subway?

Thoughts for my wife and I are . Fly into Tokyo and spend 3 or 4 days there bullet train to Osaka and a few days there.  Then hire a car and basically take off to wherever we fancy although we’ll probably pre book hotels. Seeing a few ‘tourist sites’ is on our plans but we just like to drive and see what comes up and immerse ourselves in the country. We’ll be avoiding toll roads wherever possible as we’re in no rush. Then fly home from Osaka.    Or…this is the dilemma we go north to Sendai and do the same although flights home work better from Tokyo.    So which of my plans would you recommend North or South? Or somewhere in between? ,scotsrick,,"Dunbar, United..."

Since I arrived in Japan on Nov 4th I have been successfully using an eSIM by Ubigi for data. I recommend it to anyone with a cellular phone that supports eSIM (iPhone 11 and later not sure which Android phones). I have T-Mobile which gives me 256 kb of free data but it is useless here. I cannot even send a text message to another person with an iPhone In my network. So I’ve turned it off and have been using Ubigi eSIM exclusively outside of the wifi in my accommodation. It’s given me 5G speed and sometimes LTE. I’ve used it for navigation web browsing and texting for the last 2 days and still have 2.5 of 3 GB bought. It cost only 8 US$ good for 30 days. I’ve used Airalo eSIM when I travel to France in May I found Ubigi to be much easier to install and it is reliable in Japan. I am very pleased with it. No physical SIM or pocket wifi for me ever in Japan. ,flennie,,Los Angeles...

Hi dear TP savvy’s    I am currently planning a trip using my points from Hong Kong to Seattle (seatac) . The trip is originally if all works will be Vancouver/ Hong Kong / Bangkok / Kuala Lumpur/ Singapore/Hong Kong / Seattle. Is this a good itinerary in regards to the order of countries to visit ?    Because so far I haven’t figured out yet ( except Vancouver/ Hong Kong part ) how to go ahead with my itinerary( which ones should I do 1st).    Also due to using points  I am kind of limited in my choices for the return . So seems i would be better off ( length of trip and number of points ) to return from Hong Kong to Seatac and from there get to Vancouver ( bus / train / plane all options are available).    ***The only tickets I can find goes Hong Kong to Seatac with a transit time of 2 hours only (arrive in NRT 3:20 leave at 5:25 ) is this enough time for me and feasible or should I opt for much longer trip through London or just let it go for now ?  The total length of trip will be between 15 days to 30 days ( depending on tickets and budget ) not certain yet.      Please advise  I really need your help  been before to Japan and China each once but never theses above mentioned countries. I am a solo female recently retired traveler and been to many countries always with the help and knowledge of TA kind people.    Any advice or feedback or suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I am working on a 7-day itinerary that starts with time in Tokyo and Kyoto. I was hoping to complete the loop back to Tokyo via Kanazawa and the Hokuriku Shinkansen. I am interested in booking a 2-day ryokan stay in this area. I have struggled with this ryokan selection and welcome your advice.    I would like to find a romantic spot that is traditional (serve dinner and breakfast in the room set up futons on the floor) and allows for walking around yukata-clad in a cute onsen town. Ideally it would be close to the path between Kyoto and Tokyo so as not to make for very long travel days getting there and away.    The budget allows for 1500-2500 USD total for two people for two nights. I think this should allow for one of the smaller rooms at Benita Mukayu but that level of luxury is not required. In-room onsen is okay but not required.    It seems that each property I look at involves some compromise. I like Benita Mukayu but don’t like that they don’t serve meals in-room. Houshi looks great but I don’t like the Western style beds. And so on…    Any suggestions for a great 2-day ryokan experience in this area that meets these desires?    Thank you! ,TXTonio,Hokuriku,"Houston, Texas"
Hi all    We are going to Japan for a trip soon and I wanted to check if anyone has experience of sending money to yourself to withdrawl in a Western Union japanese branch.    The objective is to automatically exchange money for example:  - Sending 1000 USD -> receiving equivalent in JPY  - Sending 1000 EUR -> receiving equivalent in JPY  - Sending 1000 BRL -> receiving equivalent in JPY    Of course for many of you there might be better options but for Brazilians doing this through Western Union would save quite a bit of taxes making the exchange much better.  If I went that way what document would I need to withdrawl my money in Japan? Only a passport? Any additional document?    Thanks for the support! ,Alauanda Vasconcelos,,"Sao Paulo, SP"

Our teenage son has multiple food allergies and associated anxiety about eating food in restaurants/new eateries.  We usually find it easier when travelling to take food for him to eat when out and about. However the other 3 of us will want to get some meals at restaurants - more quick casual (ramen yakitori izakaya) than fine dining.    I don't want to cause offence or inconvenience and would appreciate opinions on:  1. Would it be rude to just order a soft drink for him while the three of us order meals? We're willing to order an extra meal for him if necessary but it probably wouldn't get eaten. Would it cause offence to leave a dish virtually untouched? (We would rather not waste food either.)    2. I know that eating while walking is impolite in Japan but what about finding a spot to stop and eat outside? I have been to Tokyo before but don't remember if there are benches on footpaths etc. We will be there in a couple of weeks so it will be cold! Is it acceptable to find a shopping centre to stop and eat?    Thanks very much for any advice. ,marie_Perth,,"Perth, Western..."
Traveling with my sons ages 18 and 21. Arriving from Kyoto 12/27 morning. Sight seeing in Osaka 12/27. Day trip on Shinkansen to Hiroshima 12/28. Osaka morning and then Shinkansen to Tokyo early afternoon. Was planning to stay at either Karaksa Hotel Osaka Namba or Hotel the Flag Shinsaibashi for great access to most of the places we will be seeing in Osaka especially for nightlife. Realized that we will be arriving at Shin Osaka station heading to and from Hiroshima from shin Osaka station and then going to Tokyo from Shin Osaka station. So… are we better off staying at the Marriott Shin-Osaka station for ease of the daily travel from that station and just travel into the tourist area of Osaka each day? Could also stay at The Royal Park Hotel Iconic Osaka Midosuji if that location would be in the middle and makes sense. Input and insight please. ,rydyl,Osaka,west coast USA

I am thinking of flying into Tokyo spending 4 days there then going to Kyoto for 3-4 days Osaka 2 days 1 day Hiroshima and back to Tokyo. I am trying to decide if I need to spend 2 days in Osaka is there anything to do there after Tokyo and Kyoto. I would like to spend a night in Hiroshima but am wondering if it is easier to do a day trip and not have to carry my luggage for 1 night. We are 2 adults and 2 tweens.  I would like to do a Sumo wrestling show/experience Ninja experience maybe cooking tea experience and I want to check out all the unique shopping places in Tokyo. Maybe the Pokemon place. I am trying not to travel too much in-between locations but yet make it a full experience since this is our first visit to Japan. ,Pearl G,,"New York City, New..."
Is 2hours enough buffer for a domestic flight that departs at 915pm? The bus will arrive CTS domestic terminal at 7pm from niseko ,cl7,Niseko-cho,
I think the Kansai Hiroshima pass along with a few single tickets will make the most sense for our Japan trip. I just want to confirm a few things I’ve gathered from this website - https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/kansai_hiroshima/    For this pass do I just wait and buy it from a ticket machine once in Japan? Or do I need to purchase the exchange order and then get the pass in Japan?    If the latter can I exchange it before actually beginning the 5-day period?  Is it possible to exchange it in Tokyo even though that is outside the area it will be used? We will be there first and it might be the most convenient.    Our itinerary is 2N in Tokyo (Shinjuku) train to Kobe for the afternoon with single ticket activate pass for onward journey to Hiroshima 3N Hiroshima (miyajima day trip) train to Himeji and onward to Kyoto 5N Kyoto single ticket back for 2N Tokyo (Akihabara). We are 3 late-30 year olds traveling February 19-Mar 2.    Thank you for your help! ,Melissa-Brad2015,,"Boise, Idaho"
My children 13 and 15 and myself have been to iwappara 2 times and to club med tomamu 1 time . We are probably lower intermediate ski . We dont like the slopes at tomamu as there are many sharp turns that look rather scary as we are afraid we fall off trhe cliff . And many of the slopes are too steep so it takes a lot of effort to ski . In Iwappara  it is easy ski run and we can practise turns on the wide slope with no fear and ride fast and have some speed and fun .    This December  I am thinking of exploring neaba and gala yuzawa but looking at the map  it seems that the wide runs are shorter than that in Iwappara  and neaba has longer runs but with sharp turns or narrow runs .    Please advise . Thanks ,chilloutenjoy,Yuzawa-machi,"Singapore, Singapore"
I'm a very young! 70 year old and will be going with my 35 year old son to Ishigaki for 4 nights during a 2 week trip to Japan in late January 2024. We have both been to Japan before and want to go to places we haven't visited before. Particular interests wildlife and nature. Advice please as to whether we should rent a car - we have a condo rented on Ishigaki - definitely want to spend a day at Irimote. Very little info about these islands in the standard travel guides - advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance ,Wildlife&naturelover,Ishigaki,"Witney, United..."
I have read in a post about 6 years ago here asking whether there is a luggage delivery service at Odawara station and the answer was no. Has the situation changed ?    We (2 pax) will be arriving HND and staying overnight at an airport hotel and make our way to our hotel in Hakone the next day which is Hakone Kowakien Ten-yu  which is south of Gora station.  We will be travelling with one large suitcase and a carry-on each. We don't want to be lugging our bags around after we arrive at Odawara Station and then transfer to the Hakone Tozan Railway to Hakone Yumoto Station and then change to a train which would take us to Gora Station as the hotel provides a shuttle from Gora station.  If there is no luggage forwarding service at Odawara station are there taxis available which can take us to our hotel in Hakone ? ,sagu,Hakone-machi,auckland

Hi! I am helping my brother and his kids on their first trip to Japan and was hoping to get guidance and tips.    They are flying into Narita and we have a transfer set up from airport to their hotel in Ginza. I am checking if someone can suggest a transfer instead of taxi from their hotel to the bullet train since they are going to Osaka for the 2nd part of their trip? (Medical limitations so we are in need of private transfer)    Also looking for a transfer from bullet train to their Airbnb in Osaka and a transfer from their Airbnb in Osaka to Osaka Kansai airport.

Hi all my husband and I will be headed to Niseko Grand Hirafu at end December. We are regular skiiers but would love to try snowboarding for the first time there.

We are a group of 16 travellers across 3 generations. Oldest is 75 and in reasonably good health. Youngest will be 4. July 2024 (only time we can all converge)    We are vegetarian (dairy is ok) not interested in Disney/universal want to explore the culture and history: the group doesn’t enjoy museums and some of the older folks will not walk long distances.    This may be our only trip to Japan. What are your suggestions if we want to explore Hokkaido (because of the summer) Kyoto Tokyo hakone/fuji? We are unsure about Hiroshima considering the group doesn’t like museums and it’s far but it’s definitely on a must do list.    Any advise will be appreciated. We may choose to stay in apartment hotels so we can prep some of our own meals. We are open to renting a car or van for such a large group (and comfortable driving or hiring a driver/guide) for short periods of time.    Could you please advise on the below?    Rough Overnight stays    Friday July 5 - arrive at 4.30pm Osaka  Saturday July 6 - day trip to Hiroshima with bags o/n Kyoto  Sunday July 7 - Kyoto  Monday July 8 - explore Nara Kyoto  Tuesday July 9 - Fuji / Hakone  Wednesday July 10 - Shinden to Sapporo o/n Sapporo  Thursday July 11 - Hokkaido exploration o/n Sapporo  Friday July 12 - Shinden to Tokyo  Saturday July 13 - Tokyo  Sunday July 14 -Tokyo  Monday July 15 fly out at 6pm from NRT    Thanks!! ,Indie_Explorer,,NY
Hello I Need to transfer from narita to haneda airport. ANA has advised me to take a train and then a bus to get there. However I read in one of the posts that there's a Limobus that takes you there with no transfers.    Please advise as to how and where to get the Limobus and how much is the cost.

Hi. We are travelling by rail from Osaka to Nagano this week and there are a couple of different routes. I was wondering if anyone could recommend the most scenic without being massively long? I am thinking either via Kanazawa or Nagoya if either of these is particularly beautiful? I am hoping via Kanazawa might show me some more scenery I have not seen yet. After Nagano we will go to Tokyo in the Shinkansen so I do not want to go via Tokyo for the first journey. Thank you so much! ,Kate B,,"Portsmouth, United..."
Doing some research on the various metro passes.    I note there are 24 48 and 72 hour passes that I think are for tourists only.    https://www.tokyometro.jp/lang_en/ticket/value/travel/    I may be confusing myself - but are these valid on all the lines that show on the broader metro map?    In particular the Keikyu/Haneda line? (and the Oedo line)    I know it won't cover the keisel skyliner.    Looking at using it to get from Haneda T3 to Roppongi station. ,foyleroad,Tokyo,"Perth, Australia"

Hi! Sorry if I’m about to ask a silly question. It’s my first time traveling to Japan and I’m quite the anxious person.    I’ll be staying in Japan for quite some time and I’d like to bring a lot of my cosmetics. I know I can easily get them in Japan but most of my makeup is unused— unboxed and swatched but still relatively unused.    The website for Japan Customs said you can bring 24 per item. So hypothetically speaking it would be okay if I brought 24 eyeshadow palettes 24 lipsticks 24 blushes 24 mascaras etc. with me to Japan?    Now I have like 20 eyeshadow palettes (relatively small) 10 blushes 10 lip sticks an eyeliner mascara etc. I wouldn’t need to declare them at customs right?    I know it sounds silly but I just want to stop overthinking this whole thing. Has anybody else had a relatively same experience? Please help! Thank you so much! ,KKPTKSO,,
Hello  we are a party of 2 and looking to visit Lake Kawaguchi and the 5th station at Mt. Fuji then onto Hakone for an onsen and the boiling valley. My first priority is I would like to wake up and be able to look out and see Mt. Fuji unobstructed during our 2-3 day stay in this area. I regret I can't stay at a traditional ryokan because of IBS issues I would rather have a private bathroom. Maybe it's too much to ask but a view of Mt. Fuji while soaking in an onsen would be even better. Any suggestions for accomodations would be greatly appreciated. ,TravelGodsworld,Fujikawaguchiko-machi,"Morganton, North..."

Hello does anyone have any insight as to whether it is likely that the new Sapporo Stream Hotel in Susukino (Tokyu Hotel Group) will open as scheduled on 16 January 2024? We are staying from Feb 4 to Feb 7 2024 and have booked it - no payment required until check-in but am wondering on whether back up plan is required ( though this might be difficult as many are non refundable on booking or would be subject to cancellation costs if cancelled late Jan).

Hi looking for the best transportation option from HND to the Hyatt Regency Yokohama. Would prefer reasonable prices - so I've ruled out a private car service. I wouldn't mind taking the train but after a tiring long plane journey I'd prefer to not have to think about changing trains and the inconvenience of it.    Would a taxi direct to the hotel be expensive (for me that'd be over $40-$50 CAD or USD)? I went to google the cost but a lot of the taxi sites are in Japanese no translation to English or the cost varied so much.    Thanks in advance for any advice! ,CC,Yokohama,British Columbia...

Hi I'm planning a winter trip as such :  1) 2 nights otsu  2) 2 nights gujo Hachiman  3) 2 nights Hikone  4) 3 nights Takamatsu  5) 2 nights kyoto train station area but day trip to ine    I notice the passes are all 5 days but I prefer slow travel/ as I am mainly there for strolling sketching reading food and nice ryokans/guesthouses. Is there a way to get 2 passes or? Wondering how I can maximise it plus add ons otherwise I might be better without the passes    I'm considering Wakayama. Or kinosaki onsen. Is Gujo Hachiman worth the detour?    I've been to Kurashiki Uno Naoshima Takayama etc before hence shortlisted the above. ,SnowQueen85,Osaka Prefecture,Singapore

In December and after my Tokyo business meetings I will have four full days for sightseeing. I will be staying in Osaka. I am thinking of dedicating three plus days to Kyoto and one day or a half a day to Osaka.    I have been to Kyoto six times before and have seen the most famous places several times (Kinkakuji Kiyomizu Dera Fushimi Inari Ginkakuji Gion etc).    I am thinking of trying to see some things I have not seen before. Arashiyama is one place I have not been to. My list includes Nijo Castle Imperial Palace Gardens Nishiki Market Samurai and Ninja Museum.    Any other suggestions for my list as I continue to do research.    In Osaka I have seen Dotonbori Osaka Aquarium and Osaka Castle. I might just return to Dotonbori and Osaka Caste and visit Umeda. But I will do further research.    How is the weather in Kyoto and Osaka in December?    Thank you in advance. ,Traveller,Kyoto,"New York City, New..."
I'm headed to Tokyo in April and would like to do one day trip. I'm traveling alone and wondering which day trip would make the most sense: A day trip through a travel company to Mt. Fuji or taking the Shinkansen by myself down to Kyoto and joining a day bike tour around the sights of Kyoto. I understand the Kyoto trip would be a fair amount of time on a train but I'm always happy for a day in the middle of a trip that allows for some forced sitting! I also understand that weather could potentially make Mt. Fuji a bust.  Thanks! ,mercerbleecker,,

I am a US citizen taking my 84yo mom (India citizen) from Los Angeles to India by JAL flight. We have overnight layover at Haneda. I had inquired over email with JAL and Japan Embassy in India if my mom will require a transit visa. Both emailed me back that she will not need a visa. But i found that hard to believe so i called Japan Embassy in Los Angeles today and i was informed that she will need a Transit Visa but it cannot be issued and hence I should call JAL to change the flight.    I called JAL and after 2 hours hold/conversation they informed me flight cannot be changed. They offered to give me refund (flight fare allows) but the agent did not know how to process and asked me to call in evening as it will connect me to Japan.    I called in the evening and i am getting office closed message. I am unable to connect to JAL Tokyo. Since the tickets were purchased in rupees I tried calling JAL India but their website has wrong number listed. (as is evident they have listed Chinese New Year as a national holiday for India).    i stand to lose $3000 (1 business class ticket and 1 economy tkt). I am quite disappointed as i thought JAL service will be top-notch.    JAL agent has suggested i request for Shore pas during checkin but it is not guranteed.    So my question is..... does anyone have experience in getting a shore pass? Is it only for emergency and unexpected flight cancellations or can that be requested in my situation? ,IMDucatista,,so california
Hi    I am not sure if this was asked before but I am not able to find answers to clear up my confusion on what to expect and do for my upcoming first trip to Japan and hope someone can help advice and enlighten me.    I am planning to purchase the JR regional Hokuriku Arch Pass for this trip. I understand that the Pass covers certain train types & routes (JR Lines) and purchasing/reserving seats on the covered train routes is straight forward where I can do it at the JR station office/machines.    What I am worried/confused about is on journeys that I need to do transfers between covered JP train route as well as non-covered train routes.    How do I go about purchasing/reserving tickets for both the covered as well as the non-covered portions of a particular day's journey?    Do I need to exit the station during the transfer and purchase the tickets from the station office onsite?    Example:  Trip for Tokyo to Narai-Juku  1) Take Azusa Limited Express from Shinjuku Station --> Shiojiri Station (Covered by Pass) which I assume I can reserve seats at the Kansai Airport Station office on the day I get my pass in Osaka using the Klook Exchange Voucher.    2) Transfer to JR Chuo Main Line at Shiojiri Station --> Narai Station (Not covered by Pass) This is the confusing portion. How and were can I purchase this ticket? Do I need to exit the Shiojiri station during the transfer and purchase the tickets from the station office?    Any advice is greatly appreciated    Thanks and Best regards  Wu ,MYWU,,
Hi all    We hare flying into Tokyo Haneda airport from London Heathrow and will be landing at 05:35am on the 21/10. We're flying out the next day from Haneda to Ishigaki so will need to stay in the area that night but as we land so early and won't be able to check in til much later is there anywhere in the area you could suggest to take a little nap and gear ourselves up for the rest of the day?

Hi all    As the title states I’m wondering if it’s possible and worth doing a half-day trip in Otaru coming from Sapporo. Planning to visit within the next two weeks.    Our choices are:    Option A) Once our meeting finishes in Sapporo at 2:30PM we head straight to Otaru by train.  Option B) On our last day in Sapporo we have a flight at 5:45PM visit in the morning like on train by 8 or 9AM latest then back by 3PM get our luggage from hotel and back to airport.    Which option would be best in these two situations and what can we expect? Since it is winter for Option A unsure if it’ll be too dark that time when we arrive or nothing to do but at least not in a rush. Or Option B time would be against us and a bit harder to enjoy since we have a flight that same day.    Places planned to visit or do: see glassware visit Canal street eat seafood / snacks Sakamichi street. Let us know if some of these are worth / not worth going at all or if we should change / add to this list for a half-day.    Any help is appreciated ty! ,JV,Hokkaido,"Brisbane, Australia"

Anybody has an idea for a company we could contact to book with english speaking driver who can take us along with some nice stops in between the two airports?  It will be for two people.    I found one company so far (japanholiday) who seem to do that but got no answer on my request.  Most other companies seem to have fix tour schedules only so that wont work.    Any idea ?

Hi all    Noticed that most tourists buy tickets to Ghilbi Musuem on the english website (https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/tickets/) and the tickets are all usually sold out within a few hours.    Since the Ghilbi Musuem tickets are still available on the japanese website (https://l-tike.com/ghibli/) I went ahead to buy the tickets on the japanese website but now I'm not sure if I've done something wrong or if there's something that I am not aware of.    When I set up my profile on Lawson I provided the details as such: for address - Hotel's address; for phone - Hotel's phone; for my name in katakana - i used google to convert my name from English to katakana.    Can anyone advise if I'd still be allowed to collect the tickets at the convenience store and granted entry into the museum?    Thank you ,BenB,Tokyo,
Greeting to fellow travelers and wish to seek your advice. We will be driving in Kyushu in March with accommodation booked based on a rough route we have. Being seniors we do not wish to be on the road more than 3-4 hours (excluding time spent on sites + No hiking). But I am stuck in planning a suitable driving route. Based on the information below please do share with us your recommendations :  Day 1 - Late afternoon collect car from Fukuoka domestic airport & drive to Yanagawa [1 night]  Day 2 - Yanagawa canal ride + what else to do? Then drive to Kumamoto. Target to arrive late afternoon. If arrive early possible to visit Kumamoto Castle? [1 night]  Day 3 : visit other sites in Kumamoto then head out for 1 night in Aso. Is it practical to visit Takachiho Gorge as I understand the drive is around 2 hours/way before check-in in Aso? Or better to spend more time & focus on Aso via Aso Milk Road e.g. Daikanbo Kusasenri Aso Shrine?  Day 4 : Continue visit Aso (if unable to do all in Day 3). Head towards Beppu for final 2 night stay. The drive from Aso to Beppu is long. Considering visit Yufuin from Beppu on Day 5  Would like to include Kokonoe Yume Grand Suspension Bridge but is it better to do it along the drive from Beppu back to Fukuoka OR include with visit to Yufuin?  Day 6: Drive back to Fukuoka & spend a few days there. Car to be returned on day 6.    Apologies for the long message above and sincerely looking forward to your kind recommendations.  Cheers & thank you. ,DaphneTA,Kyushu,
We are in Tokyo now and wondering if we need to book train tickets from Tokyo to Kyoto then onwards to Osaka. Can we just show up on the day of and purchase on site?    Secondly we will spend 3 nights in Kyoto then one night in Osaka (want to catch the local culture in the evening) and then plan to go to Hiroshima for one night. Is that the best way to do it or should we got to Hiroshima as a day trip from Oaska?    Lastly we will take the train from Osaka back to Tokyo for four nights in Tokyo.

Also in planning to buy tokunai pass(i will just use yamonite line). Can i find it at every yamanote line station? My hostel is close to uguisudani station so can i find there?    Thank you for your answer ,Melike O,,
We are a family of 5. How easy is it to hail taxis for a party of 5? I'm also trying to decide how to get from Haneda to Ueno when we arrive. When considering time/efficiency cost and ease I think we prioritize ease (minimize walking/transfers) then time then cost. Each person will have 1 carry-on sized bag only and we are scheduled to arrive on a Thursday at 4:30pm.    If roads are pretty open in the direction of Haneda to Tokyo at around 5:30-6pm when we are actually driving I'd prefer the car service.    But if it's insane traffic then I'm thinking monorail to Hamamatsucho and then taxi from there. But not sure if it's hard to catch a taxi for 5 + luggage and then we are losing time and comfort in doing so too. Thoughts? ,ektk,Tokyo,Menlo Park...
I have used a Suica card in past travels and it has been convenient for buses even outside of Tokyo. I will be in Fukuoka 12/25 to 1/8 and plan to use the subways in Fukuoka but also buses in Saiki Oita and Beppu. Is there one card that covers all 4 areas? ,John K,Fukuoka,honolulu
Hi  Planned on going to Japan this winter but having problems deciding on when would be best to go.    I am used to cold and snow we have had around -15*C lately and possibly 50 cm of snow on ground so far.    I have been to Japan once in late March-early April visiting Yakushima as well as enjoying Sakura in Kansai and Kyushu areas.    Went to Ishigaki and Okinawa twice in May and August respectively. Never been to Japan in winter though.    I would like to return to Okinawa again possibly doing some exploring on Miyako-jima islands or Iriomote near Ishigaki since the temperature is a bit lower.    Not sure if there are any kayaking or hiking tours in Iriomote in winter.    How long would sakura be blooming in Okinawa?    I would also like to visit onsen in snow. But not sure how long snow will stay in mainland Japan. For instance Zao onsen Ginzan onsen Kinosaki onsen as well as Shirakawago    I was thinking of possibly going in late February to early March or late January to mid February. ,Getaman,,
My husband and I (seniors) usually prefer independent self drive trips but for Japan we are considering a TripaDeal 13 night tour or else a 12 night cruise.    Has anyone used TripaDeal before for Japan? Or alternatively a cruise? ,jane56,,"Sydney, Australia"
Last week my family and friends spent several days on Miyakojima which is located in Okinawa Prefecture. Miyakojima is part of the Ryukyu Islands quite far south of the main islands of Japan and on the edge of the tropics. It is close enough to Taiwan that there is a regular cruise ship bringing Taiwanese visitors on a bi-weekly basis.    My wife though a Tokyo girl loves the beaches in Okinawa and Miyakojima has the reputation of having the best beaches in Japan. But despite its beaches and the tourism from Taiwan Miyakojima remains a rather quiet and out-of-the-way place largely supported by agriculture rather than by tourism.    Our visit was during the month of July which is probably one of the worst times of the year to visit. This is because being a tropical place summers are very hot and humid. The seas around Miyakojima are very warm which sounds pleasant and indeed is if you plan to spend a lot of time in the water. But the warm seas make the summer weather in Miyakojima terribly hot and humid.    The peak months to visit are March and October which are the coolest and driest months. Another issue with visiting any of the Ryukyu islands in the summer is the possibility of typhoons which are very frequent and can cause delays to your arrival or departure.    However our friends had never been to the Okinawan islands before and July was the only time they had available so we booked the trip.    The flight from Tokyo is a little more than 2 hours the airport on Miyakojima is very small. Domestic travel in Japan is very painless compared to flying in North America or Europe. There are never more than two airliners at Miyakojima at any given time so no crowds and no delays.    We felt the heat as soon as we left the airplane.    At the airport we were greeted by car rental and taxi agents renting a car is not difficult so long as you need a small car. Large cars (big enough for our group of 6 travelers and luggage) are almost impossible not just in Miyakojima but everywhere in the Okinawan islands. We saw the shuttle bus for our hotel (Hilton Miyako Island Resort) but it was not scheduled to leave for another 45 months. We put our suitcases on the bus but took two taxis to get to the hotel.    The Okinawan islands are the Mississippi of Japan. They are rather impoverished there is no industry aside from growing sugar cane and mangoes. Though there is a tourist industry it is not yet a great source of income for the islands.    Our taxi was a good example The taxi itself was beat up and falling apart but then so was its driver. The car reeked of cigarette smoke the driver had to be at least 80 years old and had only one tooth which he proudly showed to all of us. However he was very friendly and told us a lot about the island and the things we could see or do there. He had a number of kids grandkids and some great-grandkids all of whom had left Miyakojima for better opportunities in Naha on the main island of Okinawa.    The architecture of the Okinawan islands is plain ugly. Due to the frequent typhoons nearly all buildings are made of concrete and look like boxes with a deck on top. Most were painted at some time in the past but the bright sun fades or burns off the paint revealing the concrete underneath. The tiles on the roofs of the shrines and some of the homes are held on with lots of concrete very different from the main islands of Japan.    On the positive side the roads are good being largely built by American engineers after the war. Traffic is light and if you are going to drive in Japan for the first time the Okinawan islands are the best place to do it.    As we drove along we got to enjoy see some views of the ocean which was wonderfully colorful. The water varied between pale turquoise to dark emerald green in color the beaches were bright white. There were no tall trees as these tend to get knocked down by the typhoons.    Our hotel was right on the beach with a wonderful ocean view and a great view of the sunset. On our first walk on the beach I thought the sand was artificial or trucked in like the small beaches near the Aulani and Four Seasons hotels on Western Oahu in Hawaii. But I learned the sand was natural and looked the same everywhere around the island. It was wonderfully clean and soft very different from the brown and mucky sand you see on the main islands of Japan.    Despite the heat and humidity I and my friend decided to tour the island using the rental bicycles from the hotel. This turned out to be a great way to see the place. We found small and secluded beaches with nobody no them. We got to see the flora and fauna beautiful butterflies banana trees full of fruit and large banana flowers. We also got to see some of the most impressive spiders which spun huge webs which looked strong enough to catch birds.    During the heat of the day people and animals hide from the sun but in the evening they all start prowling. I saw lots of very large hermit crabs on the beaches a large variety of frogs and something I never thought I would see which were coconut crabs. These crabs can get as big as a house cat and are quite alarming unless you know they just eat coconuts.    On our rides around the island we stopped at various small shops and restaurants to get water or an occasional beer. The people were friendly and though my friend and I can get speak Japanese (which was shocking to the locals when we used it) we usually tried to get by in English. The food was okay the beer was ice cold and excellent.    For moving our families we made arrangements with one of the taxi companies to hire a van and driver to take us around. The van was spacious the driver very competent and polite. She took us to the list of places my wife had given her which included a good cafe some spectacular beaches and a store at which to buy souvenirs. The driver was able to tell us some of the local lore and we had a good time.    Speaking of shopping you won’t find much on Miyakojima. The number-one item on people’s souvenir list is mangoes for which Miyakojima is famous. In Tokyo they sell for up to $100 each they are much cheaper if you buy them at the local shops. The stores we visited were old closed early and sold mangoes t-shirts and a few local crafts.    Overall we had a good time during our stay and we are planning on visiting again when the weather isn’t so extreme. If you are looking for a real “tropical” experience in a safe place where you can drink the water enjoy good beer and walk on creamy white sandy beaches without Jimmy Buffett music playing in the background Miyakojima is probably for you. ,Sangetsu03,,"Tokyo, Japan"
hi there.  it's our first time to Japan & not sure in which area to stay for a week.  We're from Melbourne Australia so looking for a funky happening area with good food & shopping but not too touristy / noisy or expensive.  there's just 2 of us twin share.  hoping to pay no more than $150 per night or is that unrealistic? I have no idea!    open to Air BnB & places where we can make simple meals & breakfast.  all suggestions welcomed  thanks ,LJCamby,Tokyo Prefecture,"Geelong, Australia"
Will be travelling on a cruise with my family (wife two kids 15 and 13 y.o.) stopping at Shimizu for a day (7am to 7pm).    My plan is to get off the ship visit the Shimizu fish market (Kashi-no-ichi market) which opens at 9:30 and then go by bus to Nihandaira park (Kunozan Toshogu Shrine) and the Sumpu castle/Sengen Shrine. Then back by train to the port to spend whatever is left of the day at S Pulse.    Is this too aggressive of a timetable? Can we do all of this if we are travelling by bus/train?    If not which one would you visit? Nihandaira park (Kunozan Toshogu Shrine) or the Sumpu castle/Sengen Shrine/Shizuoka? I am leaning owards Nihandaira but not sure.    The other alternative is a taxi from port to Nihandaira and then another to Sumpu. But I have not been able to find a rate estimate (the rate finder I have does not include this destination).    Thanks! ,Samy G,Shizuoka,

Hey everyone!  My friend and I are going to Japan next year.  We are traveling with Qantas from Sydney to Haneda and then with JAL from Haneda to Itami.  I was wondering if our bags would automatically be transferred from one flight to the next or do we have to pickup our bags at the International Terminal and then check them in at the Domestic Terminal? Both flights were purchased at once and are on the same E-Ticket Flight Itinerary.  Thank you! ,Roman,Tokyo,"Newcastle, Australia"
Can someone give advice on any of these hotels & locations. We have misleading info from our tour operator i think cuz he wants to sell us whats available. all are expensive so we want to be closer to the action & ski slopes. Does anyone know if there are shuttles to main niseko village from these hotels. Is that where all the restaurants will be. we have no car. Do we need a shuttle every morning to get to the gondolas? ,btsunami,Niseko-cho,Los Angeles...
Our cruise ship docks at Tokyo International Cruise Terminal Aomi 2 Koto-ku Tokyo 135-0063. We will have depart the ship in the morning - I have not yet heard how early but usually it’s around 8 or 9. Our flight leaves Haneda around 5 pm. We’ll have checked bags and carryon luggage to manage. Any suggestions for something to do? I was wondering about the JAL museum near the airport. The ship’s tour/transfer is a driving tour of Tokyo. We really do not want to have extra sit time before a long flight. We will have had 5 days in Tokyo before our cruise. ,cs9999,Tokyo,"Kingsport, Tennessee"

Hi all    As the title suggests I’m curious how sim card pickup works if I am landing in Terminal 3? The only pickup options available that I’m seeing through Klook now is from Nairta Terminal 1 or 2. Is 2 the best bet and just go to there?

We are arriving on 26/12 at 7. 30 and need to take the Narita Express to Shinjuku.  We have a 7 day JR pass that we need to exchange by the 28/12 but we won’t use it until 7/1 as we are flying to Kyoto and will activate for the last week cheapest option.  I’m confused on the trains a bit. Where do we buy a ticket at the airport for the train to Shinjuku and is it the same place as to exchange the voucher for the JR pass?  If it’s not we can sort the pass out the following day when we have a private tour guide who can help or else we can do it ourselves on arrival and save that time. We don’t want to miss the last train to Shinjuku trying to sort it and you never know if your plane will be delayed  Thanks for any advice on best way to do this ,RPtravel22,Tokyo,"Takapuna, New..."
Hello in my recent weeks in Japan I have had both a very hard fall on tailbone while climbing and serious reaction to gluten (both cases resulting from being over-excited and relaxed).

5 of us are planning a 3 nights trip to Izu Peninsula end of March 2024. 2 nights at Shuzenji Onsen then 3rd night at Mishima. Probably taking public transport but also will check out car rental. If we want to stop at Izu Panorama Park on our way from Shuzenji to Mishima (taking public transport) is there any locker either at Izunokuni Shiyakusho-mae bus stop the cable car station or up at the Panorama Park? We should just be carrying cabin sized trolley bags or duffle bags. ,Meowwww1968,Izu,Kuala Lumpur...

Hi I'll be traveling from Kyoto to Tokyo on December 30th and am wondering how soon I'll need to reserve my JR/Shinkansen tickets.    I reserved online via Klook so I wouldn't even be able to reserve until December 22th when I arrive in Japan right? ,Audrey C,,
I am looking for a hotel for 3 adults (wife 22yo son myself). the portion of our trip that we are staying in Tokyo will be June 7 - June 12. First time to Japan but have made several trips to other countries. I'm still having trouble picking an appropriate hotel in Tokyo.    I have read many posts about other suggested hotels and always find something that I am unsure of when I look into those. I know Shinjuku is top suggested for first-timers followed by Harajuku/Shibuya. I am leaning more towards Shibuya area.    I would like to get something with a good view overlooking maybe some traditional area like a temple or if by slight chance there is a clear enough day we could see Mt Fuji. Just something visually unique exciting or special to see when in the room - not just a bunch of tall buildings. Something with character. I would also like to have the ability to walk right out and within 2-3 minutes be around a convenience store restaurants vending machines etc...    Is there anything that stands out to anyone that fits my search? I just can't seem to find something that clicks with what I want.    Would love to stay around 36000 yen but would go up to 60000 yen per night. ,gsgman777,Tokyo,"Columbia, Illinois"

For the people who have hired a car and have driven in Japan: what are the downsides/chalkenges?  To pur a bit of context: we will take a train between Tokyo/Hakone/Kyoto/Nara but we also wanted to explore the more rural areas near Nagano (jigokudani etc) and Shirawaka-go for 2-3 days. Exploring those rural areas on public transport is a bit more limiting and takes a lot more time. We are 2 middle aged adults travelling with one 10yr old and an elderly adult.  Do you think it is a good or bad idea from your experience? It may be snowing in some areas and I am not sure if the car rentals offer winter tyres? Snow chains are a no-no for me.  Thanks in advance! ,marc,,
We’ve booked a holiday to Japan for November 2024. Itinerary is totally open so a one way ticket for now. We are thinking of 12 days in Japan and 5 days somewhere warm maybe a beach vacation to relax before heading home to the U.K.  Any suggestions for the second part ? Hawaii seems so far away. South Korea and Okinawa are options but not sure whether it’s suitable for relaxing on the beach in late November. Any advice from someone who’s done something similar? Thank you. ,ranoutofaliases,,Partridge Green...
Hi coming from Tokyo tomNagano for 2 days and then to Nozawaonsen. Does Nozawaonsen have atms (711) or should I get cash out from Tokyo or Nagano before I arrive. I am guessing most casual restaurants cafes in Nozawa take cash only. Rental shops and ski lifts I guess can be paid by credit card? Appreciate any advice on this and any tips on restaurants in Nozawaonsen. Thanks in advance. ,missyperu,Nozawaonsen-mura,queensland

Hi all    As part of a Japan visit we (group of four adults) will be spending a few days in Alps region travelling from Kyoto via Nagoya and Takayama.    From Kyoto we are thinking of heading straight to Okuhida valley either Hirayu Fukuji or nearer to Shin Hotaka for an onsen ryokan stay. We are willing to pay for a premium experience though what that may mean exactly I'm unsure. Following day we would visit Shin Hotaka ropeway and later will travel back to Takayama for two nights before moving on to Toyama prior to crossing Alpine route.    Can anyone recommend a ryokan / ryokans based on real world experience over fairly recent times in the Okuhida region?

Hi guys    I have a few unique questions.  I know my travelling itinerary is weird as I prefer slow and easy way of travelling compared to most travellers here who seemed like rushing from one point to another. I am not like that as I like to stay in one place for weeks without moving an inch! I felt this is the only way to enjoy what the locals do and not what the tourists do. I do not like changing hotels often preferably the same when I arrive and depart as dragging luggage is a chore in my opinion. Hence my question is I am planning to go Lake Toya end of February and was thinking without a car can I explore the woods forests and lakes around the vicinity? I have Hotel Cocoa in mind which I know it is located in the suburbs.  I might be travelling from Hakodate and take the JR Hakodate line to Toya JR. I only plan to visit the outskirts no city sights for me. And I also work online a lot how stable are the wifi in both Hakodate and Toyako.    Thanks a lot guys. ,Raymond H,Hokkaido,Malaysia
Hi there solo traveller here planning to do this trip early October 2024 for approx. 12 days and renting a car at New Chitose Airport  Roughly heading to Ashikawa to Abashiri Shiretoko National Park Akan-Mashu National Kushiro and back to New Chitose Airport. I then do a one way car rental down towards Hakodate taking three days to get there and get on the Shinkansen to Aomori for a two week road trip ending at Narita - but will ask about the Tohoku trip in another thread thanks.  Would there be a recommended direction to travel? Clockwise or anti-clockwise for coastal views etc. Also any hidden gems/off the beaten track sights/places to visit that Google doesn't often list.  I prefer the back roads staying off the highways and toll roads and away from the cities visiting small towns and villages etc and I travel fairly fast paced.  Appreciate any advice received thanks. ,Clevedon24,Hokkaido,"Auckland, New..."
This trip (April 2024) will be our 1st time to Kyoto 2nd time to Osaka.  There will be 3 of us and 2 suitcases.  We are flying into ITM via NRT (7:30p) and will take the Limo Bus to Kyoto Station then taxi to the hotel.  We will be in Kyoto for 8 nights then going to Osaka for 3 nights 1 night in Tokyo then flying home from NRT.    Kyoto: staying at the Tokyu Stay Kyoto Sanjo because of its easy access to the subway in room laundry & kitchenette and foods nearby.    Can a regular taxi found outside of Kyoto Station easily take us and our luggage to our hotel? The number of people should be OK but what about the luggage?    I really want to go to Costco.  It is more convenient to go to Costco in Kyoto or Osaka? Which is easier? At either location we will take the train+taxi; since the train stations are not that close to Costco. Which would be easier to navigate catch a taxi from Costco to the train station & return with some purchases?      Thanks Everyone!  -f ,farmerj,Kyoto,"san jose, ca"

We are planning to travel from Shinagawa to Odawara by Shinkansen and then buy the 3 day Hakone Freepass from Odawara station for our stay in Hakone.    For our journey back to Tokyo we have already bought the romance car tickets from Hakone Yumoto to Shinjuku station paying the limited express surcharge of 1150 yen each online.    I'm now questioning whether we need to purchase a normal fare in addition to the limited express surcharge for the romance car since I have read on the Odakyu website in the FAQ section that the Hakone Freepass is only valid from the departing station and back.  However the Hakone Freepass departing from Odawara does not include a ticket on the Odakyu Lines and therefore a ticket must be purchased separately to ride the Odakyu Lines    So in this situation do we need to buy a regular ticket as well for the romance car at Hakone Yumoto station ?    Thanks. ,sagu,Hakone-machi,auckland
Hey guys    I will be in Japan for 10 days visiting Kyoto (2 days) Osaka (1 day) Nara (daytrip while in Osaka) Tokyo (4 days) and Hakone (daytrip while in Tokyo). Having said this what are the best passes that you can recommend for me to get to save on public transportation? I already ran a JR pass calculator and figured that it won't pay off for me. Thanks! ,sgt_sid16,,"Dubai, United Arab..."
Hi there!  We are 3 friends coming to japan and this is our itinerary thus far    Land in Haneda and stay with family in Kamakura for 2 nights head to hakone for 2 nights 4 nights Kyoto (day trip nara while we are there) 2 nights takayma and then 4 nights tokyo and fly out.    I am wondering your thoughts on this itinerary? We are young and avid travelers and know there are a lot of places we are trying to hot but this seemed to give us a nice overview of different areas.    Lastly in Tokyo we are looking for a place to stay that has 3 beds or connecting rooms and is 5 mins or less from a JR and subway line. We are okay to pay up to 400$ a night for the room. I know Shibuya Shinjuku and Ginza are all desirable. I am fine staying anywhere as long as we have good access to transport to see as much of the city as possible. Thanks! ,elisearndt321,,"New York City, New..."

I plan to take the Hokuriku arch pass and travel Kyoto osaka Kanazawa before returning to Tokyo. There is no clear information on whether or not the scenic trains are covered by this pass. All i can see is that JR pass covers the scenic trains Hanayome Noren and belles montagnes et mer. Can someone please throw some light on this. ,UrbanXplor,,"Bengaluru, India"
Hey!    My wife and I just booked our first time in Japan and we will be there from June 10-24 2024. We are hoping to see Tokyo Osaka Kyoto and Hiroshima.

Hi All    I am bringing my parent to Tokyo.  There are total 10 pax and my mother is on wheelchair.    We will be in Japan from 25 May 2024 to 31 June 2024.

Will like to ask how can I get to Hakone from Haneda airport and which hotel should I stay in which is convenience?    Thanks. ,so_nice3,Tokyo,Singapore
Hi! I will travel to Japan from May 17-29 and I appreciate some feedback on my itinerary. I will be landing at Haneda on May 18 and fly back on May 29 from the same airport. So I have effectively 11 days at disposal. I am a bit overwhelmed about the amount of attractions and since I don't like to rush I need to prioritize some destinations. I like history old architecture food beautiful sceneries like mountains forests and coasts. I don't mind spending a few days in a modern city like Tokyo though.    18. Arrival spending day in Tokyo  19. Tokyo  20. Tokyo  21 Tokyo day trip to Nikko  22 Tokyo day trip to Hakano  23 Train to Kyoto  24 Kyoto  25 Kyoto day trip to Nara  26 Train to Miyajima (via Himeji)  27 Miyajima  28 Train back to Tokyo    Is this a realistic plan regarding the amount of days at each destinations? Am I missing a must-see place? Since I want to go to Miyajima I could also go to Hiroshima. Though it is a very historic place it does not look very aesthetic to me. Is it worth it to travel there?    I am also wondering if I have too many days in Tokyo though and that I should add one more day to Kyoto. Kyoto looks more beautiful and more ancient in the pictures to me. On the other side there are so many attractions in Tokyo and I am bit worried that I need to rush through the city in that case. I want to see some ancient temples gardens some views over the skyline maybe the National Museum and spend 1-2 hours in the manga district. I'm not so much into modern architecture though. What do you think? How many days should I use in Tokyo?    Thanks in advance    Best regards  Nicolas ,Nicolas S,,

Hi:    We’re a family of five (age ranging from 25 - 55) planning our first trip to Japan from April 10 to 24 2024. Mostly interested in nature culture and history. Crafted a 14 day itinerary based on information that I could gather but insights and recommendations would go a long way as just overwhelming for me to start with.    The itinerary I have in mind:    Tokyo - 3 Nights  Hakone - 1 Night  Kyoto - 3 Nights  Miyajma - 1 Night  Kanazawa - 2 Night  Tokayama or Matsumoto - 2 nights  Tokyo - 1 Night    Not sure if the above is a overkill in some of the places and I also feel if am I missing not staying in Osaka.    Considering the vastness and diversity of the country would like to get a feel of culture history city life nature etc.. Also I want to explore my stay with Hotel ryokan Homestays if its there Airbnb etc.. More importantly not to miss out on the Cherry blossom when there..    Any help on the itinerary number of days to stay (side tours) and nature of accommodation would be really helpful.    Ravi ,Ravi S,,"Bengaluru, India"
Hi    I’m planning an upcoming trip and this is not my first time to Tokyo / Osaka area however it would be my first time using the Shinkansen. In my research it looks to be cheaper to fly and out of Tokyo with Shinkansen round trip between Tokyo and Kyoto than flying into KIX and out of NRT/HND.    With that I am trying to spreadsheet out pricing and maybe if possible pre-purchase necessary tickets in advance of arriving. If I need to do round trip Shinkansen from Tokyo Station and Kyoto Station do I purchase that using the Smart EX app or Smart EX online for myself and traveling parties coming with me on a single account or it is fairly simple and fast to just buy it when I arrive at HND / NRT. There will be about 5 of us. If using Smart EX do each of them need their own accounts or I can purchase 5 tickets? If purchase in person at the airport is it cash only or can be purchase using a Visa Credit Card?    I think if I am flying into HND I will monorail to Tokyo Station and if I fly into NRT I will use N’EX to Tokyo Station. If I were to buy the Shinkansen on arrival I would by it at the airport upon arrival?    I am estimating the arrival time to either airport around 3:30 PM Japan Time. I am estimating the time through custom and arriving at Tokyo Station I should be buying the ticket to leave Tokyo Station around 7:30 PM Japan Time to arrive in Kyoto before 11:00 PM with our hotel within walking distance from there.    Any suggestions or your thoughts are greatly appreciated.    Thanks ,Kevin N,Tokyo,"Ontario, California"
Hi    I'm travelling in Tokyo from the 28th of Dec to the 12th of Jan.  Does anyone know if either Nihonbashi (more specifically Pokemon Center DX in Tokyo Chuo) or Sunshin City in Ikebukuro will be open on the 1st of January?    If not can you suggest any activity/place I should visit on that day? I was thinking Imperial palace but that neighborhood doesnt seem to have so much to visit (Maybe I'm wrong).

Does anyone know if I can exchange my JR Kansai Wide Pass and have help making seat reservation for Osaka- Kinosaki-Kyoto-KIX at the Haneda Airport? I fly into Haneda Airport and depart Japan out of KIX 2 weeks later. I just want to make sure we book earlier enough to get seat reservations for specific trains/time since I am traveling during the xmas/new year holidays.    I looked at the JR website it feels like I can only book JR east trains at the Haneda Airport. Can I book JR west train using my Kansai pass anywhere while I am in Tokyo?

Hello! I’ll be staying in Tokyo for 10 days and have these three places on my list. It occured to me that I couldnt find guides online on grouping these together (since theyre pretty close by).

We will be visiting Japan for the first time from mid-March to the end of the first week of April and will be flying to/from Osaka. From there we hope to travel to Kyoto and Nara Hiroshima Tokyo (not in any particular order) and to spend some time in Kanazawa and the Japanese Alps.    Please could someone tell me how the train runs from Kanazawa into the Alps? Is there a route that we might be able to stay along and return to Kanazawa or even Osaka? Are places open in late March/early April?    We are primarily interested in culture and landscape but are not looking to do long walks or to hike. Looking at possibly staying in Shiragawa-go Tateyama and Takayama and seeing the snow walls if that's worth doing. Do you have any suggestions for good places to base ourselves? ,asdfjkl,Kanazawa,"Aberystwyth, United..."

We have a 3 wk + trip coming up. I'm a little concerned at keeping things like down/ puffer jackets clean with my 10yo who can still be messy despite everyone's best efforts... :(  In the event the need arises and I'm sure it will is it easy to find dry cleaners/laundry services with fairly fast (24hr or under) turnaround times - are they often found around stations?  We're mostly staying in business hotels with self-serve laundries which is fine for nearly everything. I doubt these places will have onsite laundry services that can take jackets and return them the same or next day. Any hints appreciated. ,Renee1901,,

Hello there! I am going on a very special trip to Japan with my 77-year-old mother 45 sister husband and two boys ages 12 and 13. We are a group that is adventurous and unique local authentic off the beaten track experiences and are huge foodies. I prefer to stay at ryokan style hotels.    We have 13 nights and are currently planned to travel as follows:  3/17-3/21: Hoshinoya Tokyo  3/21-3/23: Kaga Onsen Beniya Mukayu (or Kayotei) OR Kanazawa Korinkyo?  3/23-3/24: Takayama Wanosato (could add on second night)  3/24-3/28: Shinsho-An (or Celestine or Nazuna Tsubaki)  3/28-3/30: Open  We fly out of HND on 3/30    I have a couple places reserved  Hakone-Shuishoen  Hiroshima-Setoda Azumi  Kawaguchico-Fufu  Additional 2 Kyoto nights: Suiran or Roku LXR    Which area should we stay in? This is our first trip and we may not get back to Japan so I would love any insight on which area you think that we should head to? There were no openings in Naoshima.    Also love your thoughts on the places I have chosen to stay in if you have any better recommendations for a great experience.    Thank you so much. It is much appreciated as I spent many hours researching and unsure what to do. It is my mom’s bucket list trip to show my children the cherry blossoms. ,Lauren J,,
On arrival at New Chitose Airport there appears to be only one place to change cash - no banks only Travelex. They offered about 134 yen when the mid-rate was about 147.5 i.e. a pretty awful rate. Some searching on Google revealed World Currency Shop near the clock tower. Very difficult to find in fact it has a different name but no sign in the street. You have to go inside MUFG building and there you will see a sign. There the rate was about 143 so much better than Travelex but for most people I think using your bank card in the ATM will give you a better rate. ,Paul F,Sapporo,

Hi everyone    My daughter and I had a lovely visit to the Metropolitan Building observation deck a few days ago. My husband and son will be joining us in Tokyo for a couple of days next week and they would enjoy seeing Tokyo from above.    I'm wondering whether we should go back to the Metropolitan Building or try the Tokyo Tower or Skytree. Is there much benefit in going to the Skytree or Tokyo Tower? Are the views any better or is there more chance of seeing Mt Fuji for example? I'm happy to pay the money for one of the taller towers if ot's worthwhile but the Metropolitan Building was great (and I enjoyed the atmosphere created by the piano playing).    Thanks in advance for your thoughts. ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi All    I will be traveling with two small children over Christmas and New Years and looking for advice if any pass is worth it.

Day 1 - Osaka arrive  Day 2 - USJ Osaka  Day 3 - Osaka sightseeing  Day 4 - Osaka Sightseeing  Day 5 - Kyoto sightseeing  Day 6 - Kyoto sightseeing  Day 7 - Mt. Rokko snow park  Day 8- Nara  Day 9- Himeji  Day 10 - Osaka  Day 11 - Depart    Is there a pass that would be worth it? Kansai thru pass? Osaka amazing pass?    Do I need to book train seats head of time?    Are there any attractions in Osaka Kyoto Nara that j should book ahead of time? Or just go the day of?    I've seen perhaps Legoland in Osaka you need to book ahead but not sure about other sites - sky bridge Osaka castle Kyoto temples etc.    Thank you in advance! ,Joshua L,,
Our family will be in Yudanaka/Shibu Onsen for two nights from 26 December.  Three of us have never experienced snow so plan to spend a day at a ski resort with the aim to try tobogganing tubing throwing snowballs etc.  I was quite taken by the Sora Terrace view at Ryuoo but I haven't found much information on their snow play area.  It looks like Shiga Kogen is also easy to get to and the snow play area looks good.    We don't have any snow-friendly clothing so will need to hire/buy what we need at the resort.

We are travelling from Tokyo to Hakone in the first week of Jan 2024  Even though it is going to be a very short journey we would like to experience Green Car on the Tokaido Shinkansen from Shinagawa to Odawara.  Do we need to make advance reservation on Smart-EX website given it is going to be New Year holidays ?  Also I have an iphone so planning to add Suica IC card to my Apple Wallet so I can register the Suica card on Smart ex website before making Shinkansen reservation.  But my partner has an Android so he cannot use an IC card on his phone. I have read that buying tickets on the Shinkansen charges the credit card registered to the account rather than the IC card is that correct ? In which case I will be able to buy both our tickets using my credit card but at the station I would use my IC card to pass through the Shinkansen gate and my partner would need the physical ticket picked up at the station ?    Thanks. ,sagu,,auckland

I understand that robot waiters are now being used in some Tokyo restaurants. The Jonathans restaurant chain was mentioned in an article I saw. This is a chain that I often visit on trips to Japan.  Does anyone have tips for English speakers? I expect you can choose your meal using a tablet that allows you to set the language to English.  Then when the meal arrives you take the plates.  But how do you dismiss the waiter summon the waiter and pay your bill?  NOTE: This post is not about the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku. ,mikem004,Tokyo,"London, United..."

Hello    I’ve been to Japan three times before but never prioritised seeing Mt. Fuji so would like to spend a day doing this on my next trip in a few days time.    The places I’d like to see are:    Fujyoshida Honcho St (not essential)  Chureito Pagoda  Lawson Kawaguchiko (not essential)  Kawaguchi Asama Shrine  Momiji Tunnel    I know some are a bit cliche/Insta hotspots if anyone has other suggestions I’d be happy to take ‘em!    My question is this plan feasible?    We plan to get the bus from Shinjuku do some walking and a train between location 1 and 5 and then wondered if we could hire a bike and cycle to the last two locations? I read the public transport can take a long time and people advised not to rent a car so bike seems like next best bet if it’s possible.    1. Early bus from Shinjuku station  2. Get off at Shimoyoshida  3. Walk to Fujyoshida Honcho St  4. Walk to Chureito Pagoda  5. Train from Shimoyoshida to Kawaguchiko  6. Walk to Lawson Kawaguchiko  7. Walkable to the Ropeway if we feel like it/if the queue isn't crazy  8. Bus from station to Kawaguchi Asama Shrine or could we rent a bike at this point?  9. Momiji Tunnel no idea how to get here from the shrine it's a short drive but a crazy bus journey. Could we cycle here?    I tried to check timings using Google maps but it doesn’t seem to work :( so I have no idea whether it’s a cycle-able route.    Thank you! ,Rosie A D,Fujikawaguchiko-machi,"London, United..."
Hello everyone    I’m in Japan and struggling a bit without enough time and easy facilities and would appreciate your advice on bicycle hire and luggage transfer.    My plan is to cycle from Imabari to Onomishi via Omishima (where we’ll stay one night). Prior we are in hotel in Matsuyama then apartment in Osaka (will not accept luggage delivery) and cannot cycle with heavy luggage on backs.    I’ve had this advice from Matsuyama hotel:  I remember that unless you rented a bicycle from Imabari you could not return it mid-way.  There is a bus from Omishima to Onomichi but you cannot ride from Omishima. (Setoda PA which is just across the Tatara Ohashi Bridge seems to be the closest bus stop)  We have confirmed this with Kuroneko Yamato the delivery company we have a contract with.  The answer was that it was not possible to use a convenience store as the receiving address.  ★If you subscribe to Kuroneko Yamato's Kuroneko Members service you can pick up your order at a convenience store.    I have not had an easy time getting help from Yamato via online form.    Is anyone able to readily comment on logistics of bikes luggage and buses. It will be middle of this month and good to have backup of bus option.    Thanks for reading. ,Kath W,,"Hobart, Australia"

Hello! I just returned from a 10 day trip from Japan and wanted to share my experience at Shima Onsen. I haven't heard of this place at all until I googled off the beaten path Japan on reddit and read one post about it. It was really hard to find much info so I wanted to share this gem! If you are looking for a place where the only thing you can do is relax Shima Onsen is worth consideration! It is so scenic and beautiful - you are surrounded by nature and the leaves were changing colors while I was there and it made it even more picturesque. The only thing is there is nothing to do most of the shops were closed - except for several restaurants a pottery place some snack shops a sake shop - and enjoying the onsen at your ryokan. But that is exactly why I loved my experience here - I had a jam packed itinerary in Tokyo Kyoto Takayama and Kanazawa .. it was really a great way to completely relax and not think about did I make the most of my day?. I took a direct bus from Tokyo Station which took about 3.5 hours. Here is a map link from direct Kashiwaya Ryokan website for detailed instructions on how to get there: https://www.kashiwaya.org/e/map/map.htm  If you want more info I wrote about my experience here: https://sunnytravelsblog.wordpress.com/.../shima-onsen.../  I love Japan so much and got so many great tips from this group so thank you so much! ,sunnytravelgram,,
Hello I previously asked for advice for my upcoming trip but the plan has changed quite a bit so I thought I'd ask for input again.    We are a family of 3 (40+ couple 8-year-old daughter) visiting my sister and her family of 4 (40+ couple 10-year-old boy 8-year-old girl). She moved to Sasebo a few weeks ago. She's been to Tokyo and a few other places in Kanto but hasn't yet explored other prefectures. I would like to do a family-friendly best of itinerary but my sister will be busy working for part of the trip so my goal is to save the best of the best for her days off.    A little bit about us: I'm eager to see lots of temples and shrines but I'm pretty much the only one. The girls like making art and shopping for cutesy souvenirs. The boy has a very short attention span but enjoys animals. I'm wary of visiting unethical animal cafes but I'm interested in supporting one that prioritizes animal welfare (such as Neu Cat Cafe).

Hello    I know this question has been asked many times but mine is a bit different. We currently have 4 nights in Kyoto and planned just a day trip to Osaka. Problem is we also fly out of KIX Osaka after the 4th night.    I wanted to setup homebase in Kyoto for the 4 nights but now looking at the prices for the Shinkansen it will cost the 4 of us roughly $160 total for a round trip ticket. Then another one way to Osaka two days later to catch our flight ($86 for the 4 of us).    I wanted to eliminate packing up and going to another hotel and wanted to knock out Osaka with just a day trip. But now looking at prices I'm wondering if it's worth it to do 3 nights in Kyoto and one night in Osaka before our flight.    Our first trip to Japan so I would appreciate any advice on this from some of you Japan experts.    Thank you! ,RickGee,Kyoto,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
I will be coming to Tokyo from Australia 4-13 July. It will be myself and two teenage sons.  I have been looking for a hotel room with three beds. Priced around $350 per night in probably my max budget.  I found the Tobu Levant hotel. It seems like a good fit. The airport limousine bus stops there from Haneda airport plus they have a Disneyland shuttle bus as well.  Are there any other hotels of a similar price that I should consider? I am open to suggestion as I don't have any particular area in mind to stay. This is my first time in Japan.  Would this be a suitable area to stay in with my boys?  Thank you for your consideration. ,Tracey T,Tokyo,"Brisbane, Australia"

I've been trying to put together a work around for us to get from Shin-Osaka to Nagasaki on 29 December.  Unfortunately we can't make any reservations on our JR Passes (bought under the old ticketing price) until we arrive in Japan. I see how busy this will be.  I have worked out an option for us to get from Shin-Osaka to Shin-Tosu with reserved seats.  From Shin-Tosu onwards I am a little uncertain.  I won't be able to get any reservations on the Relay Kamone or the Shinkansen Kamone until after we get to Japan. It looks like some are already fully reserved.  Could someone kindly please confirm to me that there are unreserved cars on both the Relay Kamones and Shinkansen Kamones? If so it might just be easier for us to line up for unreserved cars than try to get reservations in a couple of weeks time (if any are still available).  Thank you! ,Renee1901,Fukuoka,
On 29 Dec we are using our JR Pass to travel from Shin-Osaka to Nagasaki. Unfortunately I can't reserve anything until we arrive in Japan (I got the pass at the cheaper price). I'm hoping for the following journey:  9.20am depart Shin-Osaka --> Shin-Tosu --> Takeo-Onsen --> 13.24pm arrive Nagasaki  Otherwise the second option would be:  8:04am depart Shin-Osaka --> Shin-Tosu --> Takeo-Onsen --> 12.29pm arrive Nagasaki  Would my second option be the better time to travel? I don't want to have to leave my hotel too early on a holiday unless it's necessary in which case we will!  If I manage to get the reservations I'm after should I still expect it to be a hectic journey seeing it coincides with the busy new year travel period. Or will it be not so bad in the morning if most workers are still at work and children still at school? Maybe it only gets really busy later in the day.  Would getting reservations overcome the benefits of using luggage forwarding for this leg of our travels? We'll have 2 medium suitcases and 2 small suitcases 2 adults and a 10yo and 14yo. Kids are used to pulling their suitcases around and we're ok with it ourselves including lifting them and coordinating it all if it means the cost of luggage forwarding outweighs the benefits.  My main concern would be the fact we change trains twice - can I expect it would also be hectic at Shin-Tosu and Takeo-Onsen in which case moving the luggage so many times between different trains amongst crowds will be ridiculous?  Thank you. ,Renee1901,,
Will a transfer time of 14 minutes be sufficient if we arrive at platform 16 and depart from platform 11?  Thank you! ,Renee1901,Fukuoka,
Hi    I like to clarify on the tax refund procedure in Japan after going thru a very bad experience processing the tax refund and getting the customs stamp in Europe.    1) You can get tax refund immediately from large department stores with tax-free counter like Global Blue?    2) For those stores without tax-free counters can I go to those that have counters and process the tax refund?    3) Where do we get the customs stamp? Before or after security / immigration clearance.    4) Will there be different custom counters for check in luggage or hand carry luggage? ,trustsome1,,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hello  I bought taxe free goods bit i opened the plastic bag where they gave them to me and used some of them.  Will i be in trouble? Do they verify these things in airtport (knowing it will be not be in my carry on)  Thanks for your response ,Rrania,,
We have JR Pass exchange order which we will pick up in Tokyo on Dec 23. On Dec 29th we need to get back from Hiroshima to Tokyo. I have two questions. I have looked there seems to be plenty of space on the Nozomi Shinkansens. As we bought the old JR pass can we still upgrade this like the current JR Pass can or is there literally no difference to the pass other that the price hike? If we need to use the Sakura Shinkansen it seems much more booked out (as it is cheaper I guess) would this be anticipated to be sold out by the time we pick up our passes in a few weeks? ,Anthony E,Hiroshima,

Apologies for asking yet another transit card question. I see these 3 options in my Apple Wallet. Does it make any diff which one I choose while in Tokyo and Kyoto. And do I need to take any additional steps after adding one to my Apple Wallet? ie: transfer a balance onto it? Or does it just charge the credit card associated with my Apple Wallet each time?    Also is there a reason I should be obtaining a physical version of one of these cards over using the Apple Wallet feature? Thanks in advance. ,ektk,Tokyo,Menlo Park...
We we’re planning to visit Japan in July 2024. 1st question where do you guys suggest the best part of Japan. Do we avoid Tokyo?

Do we book our flights through Expedia or Kayak? ,154Kathy,,"Richmond, Virginia"

Please compare my itineraries below. I’m travelling to Japan for the first time in March 2024. One is Central and East Japan and the other is towards North both starting and ending in Tokyo. The second one was made after very extensive research because I’m trying to avoid very crowded places but still want that authentic rounded Japan experience. I know Japan’s tourism is coming back online nice and strong maybe a little too strong but at the same time I fear I might be overdoing it with the second one almost entirely avoiding all the touristy spots but i’ll let you be the better judge of that.  Please compare these two in terms of do-ability cost and range of things i’ll see. I’m trying to get the best of nature and authentic Japan trying to weed out extra-touristiness. Thank you in advance!    Itinerary 1 (Central and West Japan):  Day 1: Land in Tokyo and explore  Day 2: Explore Tokyo  Day 3: Explore Tokyo  Day 4: Tokyo to Osaka by train  Day 5: Explore Osoka  Day 6: Day trip to Nara/Kyoto or both (but probably just Nara)  Day 7: Osaka to Yakushima island by flight (direct flight to there are only from Osaka Fukuoka and Kagoshima)  Day 8: Rent a car and explore Yakushima  Day 9: Relaxed do-nothing day in Yakushima  Day 10: Yakushima to Fukuoka by flight in the afternoon. Going out eating at the yatai at night.  Day 11: Fukuoka to Onomichi by train  Day 12: Spend the day cycling doing the Shimanami Kaido  Day 13: Onomichi to Tokyo  Day 14: Spend the day shopping in Tokyo  Day 15: Fly back home on a morning flight        Itinerary 2 (Mostly North Japan):  Day 1: Land in Tokyo and explore  Day 2: Explore Tokyo  Day 3: Explore Tokyo  Day 4: Tokyo to Hakodate by flight  Day 5: Explore Hakodate  Day 6: Hakodate to Hachinohe by train  Day 7: Hachinoe to Miyako (spending the day trekking on the Michinoku trail as far as my legs will take me and the rest of the way by train). Maybe stay at a Ryokan for the night at Miyako.  Day 8: Miyako to Morioka by train  Day 9: Explore Morioka  Day 10: Day trip to Kakunodate  Day 11: Morioka to Hiraizumi. Cycle around and explore. Stay the night there.  Day 12: Hiraizumi to Nikko. Explore the place and stay the night.  Day 13: Nikko to Tokyo  Day 14: Spend the day shopping in Tokyo  Day 15: Fly back home on a morning flight ,Rhiju Talukdar,,"New Delhi, India"

Thank you for all the help and pointers to this point. Did I do this correctly? I looked at this website on JR-East and it says Fuji Train 3 7 and 11 depart from Shinjuku to Otsuki and then it will go to Kawaguchiko.  https://www.jreast.co.jp/hachioji/fuji_excursion/en/    I booked Fuji Excursion Train 11 at 9:30am Seat 1C and D from Shinjuku to Otskui.    Is this how you need to book it so that you can continue on to Kawaguchiko? Do I need to exit the train to catch the Fujikyu Railway? If I read correctly the are no reserved seats on that portion so I need to get a seat asap and claim it. If I got this all confused I am so sorry. Any help is appreciated. ,DallasFashionista,,"Dallas, Texas"

The hotel I'm at (in Higashiyama) has a street address of the large street (Ebisu-cho) where the main entrance of the hotel is. Twice now taxi drivers have tried to access that address by driving down a small alley behind the hotel instead of staying on the main street. I can't figure out how to fix the problem. (I speak no Japanese but am showing them the business card of the hotel which has the address written in Japanese script and Romanji.)  The hotel suggested using the address of a nearby conbini but it's simply a different house number on the same street. I don't know why that would work but not the hotel's address.  Any thoughts on how to give better directions? Thanks in advance! ,SFSusan,Kyoto,"San Francisco, Ca"
I am planning a three day trip to Hokkaido in September 2024 and would like to hike Mount Meakan but will not have a rental car or other private transport. I plan to fly from Tokyo to Kushiro and likely stay in Kushiro (City) and take the bus to Lake Akan. This seems pretty straight forward but the part I am having a hard time with is the last leg to the trail head. How difficult would it be for a non-Japanese speaker to arrange for a taxi from Lake Akan to the trailhead @ Yamanoyado Nonaka Onsen and then arrange for a pick-up some hours later from the same location back to Lake Akan?

I would like some tips on what might be open on 31st and 1st Jan in Kumamoto both things to do and restaurants.  Do people recommend aiming to have street food and 7/11 or will there be any restaurants taking bookings? Struggling to find any that are accepting reservations as I assume they are closing.    Same for things to do we would like to:  -Drive via Suitengu shrine in Kurume on 31st before we drop off hire car will it be busy before 12pm?  -visit Sakuranobaba Johsaien at some point  -do a Kimono experience  - get the train down to Misumi West Port    We are in Kumamoto from 31st until 4th so hopefully theres something we can do other than sit in our teeny airbnb!  thanks!!! ,Rosie,Kumamoto,
I’ll be in Tokyo with 3 others on New Year’s Eve and we want to do our own pub crawl. My first concern is how feasible this idea is on New Year’s? Will it be impossible to walk around and find somewhere to drink/too busy?    We want to be in an area where we can walk with plenty of options. Ideally without needing to hop on a bus or train. From what I’ve been reading Shinjuku Shibuya and Roppongi seem like the places to be but I want to avoid tourist traps like Golden Gai - I hear their entry fees kill the pub crawl idea anyway. We also know about 'Tokyo Pub Crawl' but again it seems very touristy. It doesn’t feel right being in Tokyo on NYE just to spend it in a large group ‘Contiki™ tour' of pubs.    I’d love to include an Izakaya and share a booth among the four of us. Would we need to book this?    I’ll mention I found this itinerary posted 4 years ago. Lots of cocktail bars. It looked great.

As I am going to Japan in December I was considering buying a JR pass since I was told that it will save me money but after having done some research I can't deny that I am even more confused and perplexed about it than before so I am seeking some clarity on this forum....    1) it appears that the current price for a 14 days JR pass is 80.000 YEN which seems outrageously expensive    2) I found out that JR pass is not valid on any of the local subway networks such as Sapporo Kyoto and Osaka or on local buses and trams so that means I have to pay a separate ticket for that!    3) Even when in possession of JR pass apparently I have to book my seat if I have a luggage and I have no idea how and where to book my seat and how far in advance. Anyone who can shed light on this?    4) The only reason I was thinking of buying a JR pass was to:  -Cover my day trips from Sapporo to other towns/cities  -Take the train from Sapporo to Hakodate  -Take the train from Hakodate to Kyoto  -Take the train from Kyoto to other cities for day trips such as Hiroshima and Kobe  -Take the train from Kyoto to Osaka airport  Is it still worth buying the JR pass considering my itinerary above? or is it cheaper to buy individual tickets?

For our early march Japan trip we plan to take a daytrip to Enoshima/Kamakura from Tokyo.    We will arrive at Enoshima about 10 (although we can do earlier if need be) and imagine leaving for Kamakura about 12:30/13:00.    The sights we are particularly interested in is the Iwaya Caves and the Sea Candle tower. I've been to Enoshima some years ago and did the tower but not the caves.    I recall the tower being a long walk from the station and see that the caves are even further. So I think it'd be an idea to take the Bentenmaru boat one way if it is running.    I'm trying to get an idea of timescale and order of visiting the events. If we arrive at the station and see the boat is running near the bridge should we take it do the caves first then work up to the Sea Candle/garden?    Or just head from station to sea candle then walk down to the caves then hope the boat is running back?    Anyone know much about the boat intervals? Or which order is easier/best?    Thanks ,Steptoad,,United Kingdom

Hello! We are excited to finally be returning to Japan and this time we have two weeks (4/9-4/25) to see the cherry blossoms (our first time!). I've done some research and realize that our timing may be the tail end of blossoms in Tokyo/Kyoto and potentially the beginning of blossoms more north. Our plan is to visit Tokyo Osaka Kyoto (flexible with this region) Sendai (flexible with this region) Hakodate and Sapporo. I would appreciate your advice on where to start and end our journey for the most optimal viewing of the blossoms.

Firstly for mods re the sticky in the Japan forum about specific sub forums: this qn is about Tokyo but Tokyo isn't listed as a sub forum - you had to go via Kanto first to find Tokyo prefecture. And even then I had to discover this by searching for other Tokyo topics and seeing where they were nested. I'm sure that's technically correct but for travellers it may be more obvious to have Tokyo as its own sub forum in the top level of the tree :)    Anyway I'm hoping to visit the TNM and then head straight to Narita airport. Have been looking on the website and contacting them for info on luggage storage options but no luck. Would this be possible? Cheers ,Ossie1972,Tokyo,"Sydney, Australia"
I'm surprised to see lots of people here in Sapporo including some old people not wearing a hat or a hood in -4 degrees. When I lived in Norway over 20 years ago I seem to remember that almost everybody would be wearing a woolen hat in temperatures like that and parents would tell their children and teenagers that it was bad for your ears if you didn't wear a hat. Maybe that's wrong and maybe Japanese parents only say that to their teenagers when it's -10 or -15? It would be interesting to hear what the Japanese think about this... ,Paul F,Sapporo,

Hi guys    The trip to Tokyo is coming up soon and as we're on a bit of a world tour we've all got WISE (international debit with VISA branding) cards. We'll be landing in Haneda and taking the Limo Bus and also buying Welcome Suica cards (thanks to this forum for these suggestions).    I understand we can do both using our WISE card? But we understand we'll need quite a bit of cash too - just wondering has anyone used a WISE card in an ATM at the airport? Preferably one that is between immigration and where we get the Limo Bus :)    Many thanks  Mary ,Violetsmum,Tokyo,"Wellington, New..."
Having trouble deciding between the two. Both are Superior Twin Room (Okura is a river view). Both are around the same price (Okura very slightly cheaper). Okura does seem a bit dated but rooms seem more spacious than the Cross hotel. Does anyone have experience staying in both and have a preference between the two? I am a very indecisive person. ,Sarah H,Kyoto,

I am going to Thailand and I have a stop in Japan with an internal transit which makes me have to go through customs.    This is a long trip and I have my prescribed Wellbutrin / Burpropion I have bought 7 units of 150 XL for my whole trip since it can be really difficult to get by in Asia. Can I bring them in without issue? Is there anything I need to do beforehand or I definitely can't bring them with (which would be a huge issue).    Thanks beforehand! ,Felipe Navarro,,

Hi there    Just wondering if anyone had a recommendation for a driver from KIX to the Gion area? My husband has a bit of a handicap so the most direct way we can get to Kyoto the better even if it's a bit of an expense. I see a few options online for around $225 US dollars but not sure if it's trustworthy to just book online?    Thank you! ,Beth K,Kyoto,

From what I have read if you are on a busy road in Sapporo it won't take long to get a taxi. But what about a large (ogata) taxi? Will you maybe have to wait 15-20 minutes or more?  Specifically we are a group of 6 adults and children and when we leave our apartment to go to the airport I see the taxi fares all the way are horrendous. So I thought it would be better to get a large taxi to the station and take the train. Either (a) by standing on the nearest main road to our apartment and waiting for one to come along (I would wait by myself in the cold and ask the driver to pick up the others and then take us all to the station) or (b) by making my own way to the station and standing in the taxi queue where I imagine it wouldn't take long to get a large one and again ask the driver to pick up the others and take us all back to the station.  This will be at midday and we won't be in a hurry. Of course I will have the address of the apartment and the name of the station written in Japanese to show the driver. Very grateful for any suggestions! ,Paul F,Hokkaido,

1. How can I easily pay in Japan without using cash? Is there any app or card?    (I already know u can use your credit card at most places but I'm not a big fan of that)      2. can you use your own mobile data? do you need to buy a Japanese sim card of something to stay connected 24/7?      3. Are the subways etc in Tokyo doable? Not too confusing? I'm a bit worried about this lol    If you have other tips let me know! I'm new to everything!!! thanks:) ,Loïs G.,Tokyo,"Amsterdam, The..."

I have researched for a week on how to get from Tokyo to Fuji (shimoyoshida and Kawaguchiko) and it is HARD! . I finally found this guide for tips on how to book but I still could not make it happen. Then the full lifesaver is klook which shows the dates times and sold out! Lifesaver! After seeing so many posts and videos on Fuji I am not going to risk going there for a day trip and the guides clearly say that the best time to see Fuji at Chureitta Pagoda is at 6am before the clouds take over (I watched this happen today) or at 4pm by Kawaguchiko Lake / Oishi park. I wanted to share in case anyone is struggling with this for their travels. Also another tip I got from a hotel partner is to not book a Mt Fuji view room which could cost $500 and you really only have a 20% chance to see Mt Fuji. One guy went so far as to say that he has visited 7 times and only once got the iconic photo at Mt Fuji. Hope this helps for anyone planning this and it is your first time!

Is there any bus or public transport that can reach until Kamikochi River Spot? ,panks,Kamikochi,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
I wanted to post my recent Japan trip travel tips in case they are of use to anyone.    Firstly money: yes everyone is right when they say that outside the big cities you need cash. We used the ATMs in the convenience stores.    Credit cards: take more than one credit card so you have both visa and mastercard options. Inexplicably you will find that sometimes your credit card is not accepted. This often happens at a critical moment ie in a taxi on the way to the airport so it makes sense to have a backup.    JR Pass. What nobody tells you is that if you are planning to fly in late and then exchange your voucher and continue your journey then the office which handles this will be closed. The one in Osaka main station shuts at 5pm. Also you cannot use Nozomi shinkansen trains on an ordinary JR pass You cannot even pay a supplement when on the train. This happened to us and we were asked to leave the train. Making reservations: whenever we passed the office to make train seat reservations it was absolutely heaving with people. So we didn't bother. Not a problem for us however I wouldn't do this on a public holiday.    Luggage forwarding: recommend this service. It makes train travel easier. However some hotels refuse to help you with the form which needs to be filled out in Japanese. Convenience stores also send your luggage for you however it is pot luck getting someone who speaks English.    Mobile WiFi - rental. This is a must. We didn't get the mobile translator that was offered as we thought Google translate would be fine. It isn't. The speech service for translation on Google translate is rubbish but it is ok for short typed in phrases. I saw the translation device being used and it is really good. We also had a subscription to Red Tel so we could make calls over internet. This was invaluable when we had problems with our hire car.    Hotel Rooms: unless money is no object these are going to be small - without stating the obvious! We took a pegless washing line for hanging up hand washing. Also take long leads as often the sockets are not near the bed if you want to sit in bed using your mobile while it is charging. I wouldn't bother with a hairdryer - it was supplied in all the hotels we stayed in (3* and above)    Driving: motorway tolls are very expensive and you should avoid them if you can. This does mean that your journey will be longer on the smaller roads and you should factor this in. Do not trust the Sat Nav that comes with the car we found this very unreliable and preferred to use google maps instead which had a much better interface. Driving is easy from a point of view of road manners.    JAL: literally impossible to get through to anyone via their customer service. Shocking. We were on hold for HOURS. Finally managed to get through to the Japanese language desk. If you have an issue such as we did (they changed our flights but we could not log on to the website to accept the change) this caused us an immense amount of stress. The website for JAL is very very user unfriendly. This would be fine if you could speak to a real person easily but you can't. They eventually reply to emails after a long delay but with a standard response that doesn't help. Really infuriating. Flights themselves were ok however exceedingly hot on board and there is no way of individually adjusting air flow above your head. ,liz,,
Hi we (our family of 5) will be going from Kyoto to Hakuba for a few days then onto Nozawa Onsen in January. We are trying to work out how to go from Hakuba to Nozawa Onsen ideally via the snow monkeys. We would rather do it all in one day to reduce time off the slopes. We would love any suggestions please. Has anyone heard of being able to hire a car at Hakuba and return it at Nozawa? We only really need a car to get between the 2 places and be able to stop by the snow moneys en route. Or any other suggestions appreciated. Thanks so much ,jane m,Nagano,"Brisbane, Australia"
Hi    I will be in Tokyo for 4 days and likely to use the subway quite a bit so looking at getting the 24/48/72hrs subway pass. It is not clear from different website the information about the starting date/time.    On Tokyo Metro Website FAQ https://www.tokyometro.jp/tst/en/index.html it stated:    “It is valid for 24 48 or 72 hours after it is first inserted into an automatic ticket gate. You can check the valid period on the back of the ticket.“    But on its main page https://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/travel/ it says:    Valid period or Effective Time  Tokyo Subway 24-hour Ticket: Valid within 24 hours of the time of purchase  Tokyo Subway 48-hour Ticket: Valid within 48 hours of the time of purchase  Tokyo Subway 72-hour Ticket: Valid within 72 hours of the time of purchase    As I will be in Tokyo only a few days later after arriving Haneda Airport I wonder I can buy the pass at the airport and start using it only when I return to Tokyo later?    Thanks for clarification. ,Goldenbear1980,Tokyo,Bukit Fraser...
There seems to be mixed messages as to whether Welcome Suica vending machines are available at Narita? Can anyone confirm that? The Suica website mentions machines at Haneda but not Narita.    My wife and I are arriving rather late on an international flight at 19:40 after the JR East Travel Center has already closed. Hotel is Prince Gallery.    Once through customs I think I have a handle on getting our Yen (7Bank Machines) N’EX tickets (JR ticket counter but only one more train running that late).    Will shops still be open to either get a SIM or a pocket Wifi at that late hour?    I don’t think I need a separate JR pass since the only other train trip planned is the Shinkansen to Kyoto and then the return to Narita from Tokyo after seven days. Is there a more economical ticket that includes all that?    Thanks in advance. ,dw732,Tokyo,Chicago

Hello    My friends and I are planning to visit Hakone on December 29th. We will depart from Shinjuku at 7:37 AM on the Romancecar. On the same day we'll complete the Hakone loop and then stay at a ryokan in Hakone Yumoto. On the 30th we'll head to Kyoto.    I'm wondering whether I should purchase the Hakone Free Pass and which kind or just buy regular tickets. Also I'm a bit confused about the Romancecar tickets. I've reserved a seat in the rear observation deck but the confirmation email stated To ride the Odakyu Limited Express Romancecar both a regular ticket/freepass and a limited express ticket are required.

Hi everyone    My family and I are planning to go to Japan this December (2023). We will be there for 14 days We've created a list of places we would love to visit and to keep things short basically they're spread in these areas:  1. Tokyo (3 Days) - including arrival in Japan (NRT)  2. Nagano (2 Days)  3. Kanazawa (1-2 Day(s))  4. Kyoto (4-5 Days)  5. Osaka (3 Days) - Including departure from Japan (KIX)    Looking at that list We're currently thinking of buying JR Hokuriku Arch Tokyo Osaka Pass (7 days) and Wide Kansai Area Pass (5 days). We will activate the Hokuriku pass from the first day until the seventh day and then we will wait 2 days to activate the Kansai Area pass. Keep in mind that we will also buy SUICA/PASS MO for our daily transactions and uncovered transportation. My question is should we go by this plan or just buy 14 day nation wide pass? Thanks in advance! ,panks,,"Jakarta, Indonesia"

Hello trying to bet on which day I might want to go from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko to try to see Mt Fuji. Checking accuweather it looks like Dec 7 and 8 could be sunny. Any recommendations on best place to check for weather. I don't think we will get there early enough to walk up to Churreito Pagoda since that is a bit further from Lake Kawaguchiko.

Well Visit Japan Web is not exactly a walk in the park but I've done it for the whole family (almost!)  I registered the children as family members under their mother and they all got customs declaration QR codes but when I try to get the immigration code (have tried several times) it just goes back to their mother's information. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or there's something wrong with the system because searching here I found the post Questions before we land in 3.5 weeks which says: We're a family of 4 (two young kids) going to Tokyo in just over 3 weeks and we want to a few things before we land  - Visit Japan Web – We already uploaded our proof of vaccination and it was approved within minutes However kids are not vaccinated. I can see all 4 QR codes for immigration and customs declaration.  So it seems others have got immigration codes for their children and as those children were young they were presumably registered as family members.  Our oldest child is 14 and has an email address so in theory he could have done Visit Japan Web by himself and got his own QR code. But the others are too young but not babies and infants.  It says Those who are unable to complete procedures alone such as babies and infants can be registered as family members traveling with you.  Anyone have experience of registering children as family members? Did they get an immigration code? Can we just go to immigration in Japan and show them that we've completed all the details for the children and that the parents have immigration codes? ,Paul F,,

If I buy the thunderbird limited express train tickets from Osaka to Kanazawa are we allowed to exit in Kyoto and re-enter? If not I need to buy separate tickets for each leg of the journey? Thank you! ,Jem,Osaka,
Our flight arrives KIX at 16:30 and we want to get to Hotel Gracery near Sanjo and Shiyakusho Mae. I believe in the past there was a direct transportation method (limousine bus) that go from KIX to Sanjo; but seems like not anymore. What is the easiest way now? Thanks!! ,Mavis P,Kyoto,San Francisco...
Hi there we are a group of 7 (2 parents 5 adult kids 15-22 yrs old) and we have 3 nights in Tokyo in mid Feb before flying up to Sapporo for 5 days in Niseko  Would love recommendations for which part of Tokyo to stay and any specific hotel recommendations would be appreciated.  Nightly budget will be up to max $1000 aud for any combination of rooms. Happy to be all bunked together or in 2 rooms or in individual capsules even!  We fly from Australia into Narita Tuesday 13th Feb arrive 6.30pm.  And then fly out of Haneda to Sapporo at 8:25am on Friday 16th March.  The teenage boys would love to go to a night time car meet. And the 20-22yr old girls will just want to go shopping!  We love to be in the heart of all the action and keen to eat as much Japanese food as possible!  Thanks for any advice ,TwdCoastFam,Tokyo,"Casuarina, Australia"
Hi    I will be staying in Kanazawa and take the bus to Shirakawa in the morning. I'm considering to take another bus from Shirakawa to Takayama around noon and toured Takayama for 3-4 hrs before taking the last bus back to Kanazawa. Do you think it's worth a short detour in my case? I will already have visited Kyoto by that point. So I'm also wondering if I'd find the historic area of Takayama too similar with Kyoto. I am interested to try the Hida beef though. ,Jeff C,Shirakawa-mura,Walnut Creek...

I have registered on both JR East and SmartEX App and wish to purchase tickets for the trip Nagano to Kyoto on 2 January. I can’t find the link to book on the JR Central website though I can see the timetable for the journey there with Shinano for the first leg Nagano to Nagoya and then Shinkansen for the second journey. It seems the SmartExApp only covers Shinkansen trains? I’d appreciate if anyone can provide me with a link to the page where I can book the journey when these seats are released (2 December at 10am Japanese time). Thank you! Sandy ,Sandy H,,

In all the research I did for our Japan trip I never read to avoid flying out of Kansai so I decided to post. I don’t know what Haneda or Narita are like for departures but Kansai/Osaka was an absolute nightmare. 90-120 minutes in security line. I’ve never seen such a thing. Avoid if you can.

Hi all during my research I found out that tattooed people are generally not allowed into the public onsen.  As I spot two tattoos I guess I am left with private onsen or none at all.

I would love to stay a night at a onsen hotel with private onsen but it is next to impossible to find one that has smoking room (yes I am a smoker so I want a smoking room).

Hi everyone  I've been searching for quite a while to get a good idea of how to buy ski lift passes for Furano but am just getting confused by conflicting information out there.  Can anyone who has been to Furano tell me:  Is it possible to purchase day lift passes in advance online if you are not staying at a Prince Hotel? We are staying at an air bnb style apartment. I have found a site called Wamazing.com which seems to sell them does anybody have any experience with that?  If you can't purchase online can you purchase a lift pass the afternoon before at the ticket offices so you can get straight onto the slopes the next morning?

I have been looking at the rules of this pass from the various online companies that sell it and I was tempted in particular by one description which mentions Osaka to Koyasan: The pass allows you to use trains buses and subway lines in the region with the exception of JR trains.Here are the lines you can use this pass on (a list follows among which is Nankai Railway (Osaka - Kansai Airport - Koyasan). However on another site this statement is made: Note that the NANKAI trains do NOT accept the Kansai THRU pass.    I expect that one of these conflicting statements is current and the other obsolete but of course the sites don't tell you when they were written. So can someone please enlighten me: can one visit Koyasan from Osaka on the Nankai line with the Kansai THRU pass?    Thanks for all help! ,AlanJ,,"Glenbrook, Australia"

Hello. Traveling with my 2 sons (ages 18 and 21) in December and will be in Hakone for one night staying at a Ryokan. I have multiple options and can't decide which to choose.    They are located in 3 different areas of Hakone and the prices are also a huge difference. I am interested in the onsen experience but my boys will likely not go in (maybe if private). Want a great dining experience and food. Will be visiting the open air museum either the day of arrival or after breakfast before traveling on to Kyoto. Will be doing the loop either the day of arrival or after breakfast before traveling on to Kyoto.    Looking for recommendation from those who know the areas and ryokans. Want a great experience but is the significantly higher price is worth it or is the bargin ryokan (reserved months ago so got a great price) great as well? Much appreciated as I need to decide in the next week.    1. Mount View Hakone: 2 rooms sink and toilet in room (showers only in public or private onsen) kaiseki dinner in dining room $388 including dinner and breakfast. Public bath with open air natural hot spring. Indoor private bath.    2. Matsuzakaya Honten: 2 rooms bathroom with shower in room kaiseki dinner in dining room. $926 including breakfast and dinner. Public bath and open air bath private bath.    3. Hananoyado Fukuya: 1 room with private open air bath in room. Private bathroom and shower in room. Also have hot spring bath and open air bath public. Kaiseki dinner served in room. $947 including breakfast and dinner.    4. Hakone Fura: 1 room with sink and toilet in room no shower (only in onsen) kaiseki dinner in dining room. $475 including breakfast and dinner. Hot spring bath.    I would really appreciate input! Thank you very much. ,rydyl,Hakone-machi,west coast USA

Ideally we would like to catch a taxi from Kawaguchiko station to the Pagoda. But is it easy to catch a taxi? Any long queue issues if we arrive at Kawaguchiko station around 9.15am on a weekday?    Alternatively my next option is to book train tickets to Shimoyoshida Station and walk to the Pagoda and I think I also need to pre-book this ticket online just in case the train tickets are sold out??

I really want to do to Shanghai and Tokyo Disneyland. But I hear they are very busy and overcrowded most of the year. I hear that January after the Christmas and new year celebrations are over the parks are kind of quiet for  a few weeks. I also found out that it’s very cold then about 5 degrees. We live on the tropical island of Siargao in the Philippines. It’s not a dry of most of the year with a few months it’s hot and wet. So we do not have any winter clothes. Can you hire winter clothes in Japan?  I also hear that May the week after golden week is meant to be kind of quiet. That would be a better time to go as the weather is not cold then. I realise that it won’t be completely quiet both those months. Any ind would be great. ,Sam J,Tokyo,

Hi everyone    I just thought I’d ask for an advice or if anyone had similar experience. I booked 2 days USJ tickets from Klook. I upgraded both bookings with their “satisfaction guarantee” which is like an insurance if in case it rains or an attraction is under maintenance they will give me a refund… I booked 2 days and Both of them were in the “booking processing” status for about a day and were never confirmed. And then Klook cancelled them because they said tickets were sold out. Now I noticed in my refund details is that they only refunded the amount of the tickets but not the upgraded which cost me about $36. I just find it unfair like why wouldn’t they refund that. It was not my choice that my booking were canclled. It was them and their system. My booking was not even confirmed why wouldn’t they refund that. How can they claim money from people when no service was rendered? It kinda makes me think that its a scam. 😔 ,Catmare,,"Manila, Philippines"

We'll be arriving into Hiroshima on 31 Dec and departing again on 2 Jan in the morning. This is our second visit to Hiroshima. Last time we did the Peace Park memorial area but would like to do it again this time as the children are older. We did Miyajima last visit so don't plan to go again. Instead we would like to spend some more time in downtown Hiroshima.    I see the Peace Park museum will be closed on 31 Dec but open again on 1 January which works perfectly. Does anyone have any suggestions for good options for 31 Dec in the evening - will restaurants be open or closed? Also on 1 January will downtown restaurants and shops likely be open or closed?

For my first post I was hoping to get advice on an upcoming trip to Japan. My partner and I are going in early May (we are 1 male and 1 female). We have only 7 full days available to spend and here is what I had in mind to make the most of this short time:    Day 0 - Arrive Tokyo  Day 1 - Some Tokyo and train to Kyoto  Day 2 - Kyoto activities or day trip  Day 3 - Kyoto activities or day trip  Day 4 - Travel to a ryokan stay (location TBD)  Day 5 - Ryokan stay  Day 6 - Train to Tokyo  Day 7 - Tokyo activities  Day 8 - Depart Tokyo    Although I welcome feedback on the itinerary overall I am especially interested in advice on the 2-day ryokan stay. I have struggled with ryokan selection. I would like to find a romantic spot that is traditional serves dinner and breakfast in the room allows for walking around yukata-clad in a cute onsen town. Ideally it would be close to the path between Kyoto and Tokyo so as not to make for very long travel days getting there and away.    The budget allows for a little bit of a splurge—for example we could do one of the smaller rooms at Asaba or Beniya Mukayu. Spending that much is not required though. In-room onsen is okay but not required.    I understand that everything is a compromise. I like Asaba if the right room comes available but it feels like a backtrack. So I thought that we might complete the loop from Kyoto back to Tokyo via the northern route by way of Kanazawa and the Hokuriku Shinkansen. I like Beniya Mukayu but don’t like that they don’t serve meals in-room. Houshi looks great but I don’t like the Western style beds. And so on...    Any suggestions for where to search for a great 2-day ryokan experience that meets these desires?    Thank you! ,TXTonio,,"Houston, Texas"

Does anyone know if FUK has an international to international transfer line like NRT where you don't have to clear immigration and customs. We went through during the summer coming back from TPE with a 16hr layover so we cleared immigration and went to the city so I don't recall if they had this line or not. However this time we have a 2 hr connection HNL-FUK-TPE on so our bags should go through all and hoping we can just get off the plane and walk over to the next gate. ,jle20007,Fukuoka,

Hello just trying to get my head around the best most cost effective way to travel. We are 4 adults.    So i am planning to travel from  1. Yokohama to Kyoto (return ticket?)  Stay 2 nights; visit Nara Arishiama and few other places    2. Kyoto to Hiroshima  Stay 2 nights; visit Himeji Castle on the way Nagasaki and Miyajima island    3. Hiroshima to Osaka  Stay 3 nights; visit Dotonburi Universal studio and local activities yet to plan. Any suggestions let me know.      4. Osaka back to Kyoto then onto Yokohama (if i can buy a return ticket which may be cheaper. What the validity for return tickets can i book online?    Would a Kansai Hiroshima 5 day pass be better or individual tickets? Which days would be better to active the pass for better usage?  The 7 day JR pass is only at break even with the calculator and much more expensive thean the K/H pass which i think is better value.  Hotels booked so changing route of travel is harder.

My son is graduating from college in May and we’ve both always wanted to visit Japan. So I’m planning a 2 to 3 week trip with Tokyo as our first destination. Japan seems very intimidating due to the language and I don’t know where to even start sure where to start. We both are in great shape love to eat and explore history. Im planning on using a lot of guided tours etc. I’m not sure where to go after Tokyo…maybe Osaka? My son and I have traveled a lot together and we found we don’t like moving around too much. We’d rather take our time and explore and area deeply before moving on. Any ideas on where to start would be so appreciated! ,famvacation2016,,Portola Valley...
It looks like Narita Express and then change to Kodama Shinkansen but should I change at Shinagawa or Tokyo? which is an easier transfer especially with luggage in tow and so availability of elevators/lifts would be great.    Secondly is anyone familiar with this? On google map Toyoko Inn looks near enough to ATami station but does anyone know the journey with luggage from the time i get off the train at Atami station to the hotel is it gonna be straightforward enough?

Hi I'm going to Japan in 2 week's time. So excited now and yet so anxious too.    I will be arriving at Narita airport around 10am and plan to go kanazawa directly..so either I travel to Ueno then take Shinkansen to Kanazawa or go to Kyoto station and travel by Shinkansen to Kanazawa.    Perhaps it is easier to take Shinkansen from Ueno as I have been reading that Tokyo station is complicated and crowded. But I am worried if I would be able to get tickets for Shinkansen especially for reserved seats with big luggage. Do I have to buy this ticket in advance? Or I can simply buy on the spot ?    I have a family of 5. Would appreciate any advice. Thanks! ,Familyfun2a3c,,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi  Just to want to ask TA community about this concern of mine. Few years back I had a very very bad experience in riding the cable car in Erice Sicily. The car did not come to a full stop and passengers were literally jumping out of the car. I being a senior with bad knees yelled at the operator to stop the car; Rather the car continued to move slowly but jerking and not completely stopping. So I too jumped and almost fell. Do Hakone cable car and ropeway come to a full stop and allow passengers to get off safely? If not this sort of activity is not for seniors esp those with bad knees. Thank you for the clarifications.  Ts ,sonofdragon,Hakone-machi,"San Jose, California"

To be honest I am quite frustrated with Japan Airlines. I booked flights for a trip to Thailand through my travel agent and it included a change of airport in Tokyo. I was not in an alert so I did not think to question a 3 hour 45 minute layover with transfer time because I figured if Japan Airlines made this itinerary surely is it possible.    We arrive at Haneda Tokyo airport then depart Narita Tokyo airport just 3 hours and 45 minutes later. They are both international flights but on the same ticket and through the same airline.    I have read quite a few forums and articles saying that people recommend at least 5 hours if not 6+ to make this transfer possible yet the airline is telling me that the minimum requirement is 3 hours. I am frustrated because it feels like a losing battle.    I have called and called Japan Airlines and my travel agency and because my layover time technically meets the minimum 3 hour requirement if I wanted to change my ticket (premium economy not even first or business class) it would be considered a voluntary change therefore quoting me at over $4000 per person to adjust my outbound itinerary which is ridiculous seeing that I spent $2400 total for 2 people round trip.    I am so frustrated because I feel like there is no way that we can land get through customs find our baggage at baggage claim catch the limo bus buy bus tickets ride the 60-90 minute transfer to Narita get checked in recheck our baggage go through security and make it to our gate within 3 hours 45 minutes. I so wish the airline was more understanding and helpful but unfortunately we keep getting duds with little empathy. So much for a relaxed honeymoon.    Has anyone made this transfer successfully given my layover time? Especially recently since the Japan visa has been lifted and/or during afternoon hours of 2pm to 6pm? I have tried and tried to change our flights but have had zero luck. Any advice or good news would be appreciated. Thank you in advance. ,hc,Tokyo,

My flight will be arriving at Tokyo Narita Airport around 6pm on Dec26th and my plan is to go directly from there to Osaka where I will base myself for 5 nights before heading to Tokyo on Dec31 for NYE and beyond.

We are planning to travel to Japan and Korea in March/April of next year. One possible itinerary for our flight home is with JAL that leaves Seoul stops at Haneda then continues to the US. There is 1h50m layover time in Haneda to get to our JAL flight back to the US. Is this enough time for a transfer?    I assume that both flights would be in the same terminal but do we have to go through any immigration or security lines after coming off our JAL flight from Korea? I assume that when we check in in Seoul we are checking in for the whole itinerary (Seoul > Tokyo > US) since we're using JAL for all segments. ,Ilike2travelallover,Tokyo,"Chicago, Illinois"

We are headed to Japan in October 2024. I'd like to spend 2 days/1 night in Hiroshima/Miyajima. Would a weekday visit be better? Maybe Friday/Saturday? or Saturday/Sunday? Also.. what might be the best area to stay in for 1 night? Thanks!! ,TeachinCa,Hiroshima,Los Angeles
We'll be arriving into Nagasaki around 1.30pm so presumably after checking into our hotel we'll be ready to start sightseeing by 3pm (Dec so maybe up to 2hrs of light left tops).  The activities I currently have for the remainder of the day and into the evening are (in this order):  Glover Garden (for the day view of Nagasaki not to see the buildings)  Meganebashi Bridge  Shokando Castella store  Dejima  Mount Inasayama (for night view).  Unfortunately this will be the only time we can see Nagasaki sights plus some of the other attractions we would have liked to see will be closed for New Year break.  I'm concerned this itinerary might not be achievable between say 3pm and 8pm? If that's the case which of the views is better to see - a day view of Nagasaki from Glover Garden or the night view from Mount Inasayama?  Thanks! ,Renee1901,Nagasaki,

Aloha my wife 4 year old daughter and I are travelling to Japan in February. Flying in to Kansai and staying near Namba Station. Thinking of just getting a taxi to our hotel from the airport since we will be landing late in the evening and don't want to have to deal with the train and our luggage with the kid. Thought about just forwarding our luggage from the airport but as we are just arriving would like to have our luggage available to us that night. After luggage forwarding costs and train tickets i don't think the price of a taxi is too unreasonable for the convenience.    So my question is can i get a Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport at Namba Station the next morning? We will be moving on to Kyoto then to Tokyo are these the best IC cards to get for our travels? The JR Pass does not seem economical for our routes. Mahalo for the help!!! ,jkfrank808,Osaka,"Kailua, Hawaii"

Automated machine or JR ticketing centre?  2) If this can be done at Okubo station: would the local train from Okubo to Shinjuku station be covered with this as well? If so how does it work?

We would like to go to one of the 5th stations on Mount Fuji. For those who may have done either option. Do you think it's less stress/better to just book a Day Tour that goes thru Hakone includes lunch?

I'm a mature experienced solo traveler who's not visited Japan. Thinking of a three week visit to Japan in the mid-March to mid-April timeframe. Traveling from eastern US so best flights seem to be round trip into Tokyo (returning from Osaka involves an extra stop in Tokyo).    My main interests are Japanese culture - temples castles gardens - not so much nightlife.    Thinking of a few days in Tokyo when I arrive with possible day trip - Mt. Fuji?  Kyoto with a day trip to Nara (or stay overnight?) Is a week too long?  Osaka - possibly for the castle not a big foodie or into nightlife  I do want to see Himeji Castle - is there somewhere you would suggest for a quiet area (Roykan stay?) for a few days?  End up back in Tokyo for a few more days before flying home.    Does this make sense? ,IRHS,,Rochester
I went to Narita Airport and wanted to buy Skyliner ticket on platform (I've used Suica and entered the gate) but looks like the vending machine there didn't accept my credit card despite there's an option that says buy with credit card. I used 3 credit cards including Visa and AmEx but none of them worked.

We’ll have 1 big luggage 1 smaller one and a foldable stroller so would prefer location that’s a short walk from either train station or airport bus stop.    Hopefully will relax for those 2 nights and go for short sightseeing have decent food and adjust our kid to the time difference. ,schirac,Tokyo,Sydney
Hi    Please let me know what you think of the below itinerary.    Osaka 3 nights  Kurashiki 2 nights  Hiroshima 1 night  Kyoto 6 nights  Magome/Tsumago 3 nights  Takayama 4 nights  Kanazawa 4 nights  Hakoke 1 night  Tokyo 4 nights    I want a good mixture of modern and historic Japan. I also want to visit more tranquil and rural areas of Japan.    I appreciate this is just covers a small area but I prefer a slower pace to really try to immerse myself.    Are there any destinations where I am spending too long/not long enough? Are any of these destinations repetitive and time spent better elsewhere? Can any be done adequately enough on a day trip? Am I missing in must see destinations in the area?    Would love to know your thoughts.    Thanks in advance. ,Jonathan R,,
Hi  We arrive the 29th of december in the morning. We will pickup our railpasses and pocketwifi and we are wondering how to travel to Hiroshima by train. Some questions that come to mind:  Is there a direct train from either the airport or from somewhere in Tokyo?  Do you need to reserve a seat and is that possible on the same day as arrival?  Does the JRpass cover this trainride / or how do you buy the supplement ticket?  Any general advise is welcome. We dont have a travel plan yet but we were thinking about arriving in the morning you cannot go into the hotel yet might as well travel ahead and stay in Tokyo at the end of the trip. ,Jerry,,"Amsterdam, The..."
This will be my first trip to Japan. I’ve traveled solo in many countries but I feel a bit overwhelmed planning this trip.    This is my proposed itinerary:    Tokyo - 4 nights  Hakone - 1 night  Kyoto - 4 nights  Hiroshima - 2 nights  Osaka - 2 nights    I am thinking about making these my bases with some day trips from Kyoto Hiroshima and Kyoto.    I can tack on 2 more nights but not sure where? Any suggestions to the above - considering its winter.    Thanks!! ,Beverly R,,"Chicago, Illinois"

Hello where can I buy a good quality cabin size Trolley Bag in Tokyo? I’m looking for a soft sided bag not one of those hard polycarbonate ones. Muji has only hard material ones.    I have heard of Ginza Karen but have read comments that the quality of luggage they sell is not durable although inexpensive. However I will still check there.    While searching online I came across a brand called HIDEO WAKAMATSU and I liked some of their models but it seems they do only mail-order. Does anyone know if this brand is available in shops in Tokyo?    I would be grateful for any recommendations. I would be willing to pay up to approx Yen 20000. Thanks. ,fnmistry,Tokyo,

I have a question regarding my Japan itinerary:    I will be in Japan for 15 nights in November arriving the 11th and flying home on the 26th    I’m slated to be in Tokyo from the 11th to the 15th then head to Hakone from the 15th to then 17th for onsen ryokan and foliage. Then head to Kyoto from the 17th to 21st. Then on 21st to Hiroshima for 2 nights then Osaka for 2 nights. One last night in Tokyo then home.    I’m trying to decide if I should stick to that or if I should cancel the 2 nights in Hakone adding an additional night to Tokyo and an additional night in Kyoto    Another possibility would be to cancel the 2 nights in Hiroshima adding an additional night in Kyoto and an additional night in Osaka. In doing so I’ll miss out on Hiroshima and miyajima Island but I’ll be able to take a day trip to Nara from Kyoto or Osaka    Or just stick to the original itinerary…. What are your thoughts?    Lastly what would you do the last half day/night in Tokyo. (I’ll be staying in Shinjuku the first leg)    Thanks so much for your help!! ,TOMEETHYROID,,"New York City, New..."
Is it recommended if I plan to visit Dazaifu with my family on Jan 2 yet dont plan to do hatsumode as we are not buddhists? We just wanted to get a feel of the Japanese culture and also visit the shops/restaurants around Dazaifu. Is it worth it? And will the shops/restaurants around Dazaifu open on January 2 considering the expected number of hatsumode goers that are expected to show up on these locations from 1-3 Jan?

Hi    We are hoping to stop off at Shirakawa go on the way to Kanazawa from Takayama. We are planning to take the Nohi bus but I have some questions about the ticketing.    Can I buy a through ticket that allows me to stop in Shirakawa go on the way? I'm not sure how long we will need to spend in Shirakawa go - maybe a couple of hours?? Is anyone able to recommend an approximate amount of time to spend here to have a reasonable look around?    Do need to book the bus much in advance? We will be in the area in the first few days of December. I don't want to miss out on seats - would a couple of days beforehand be okay?    Thanks in advance for your help. ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"
Hello    We are visiting japan early May 2024 and we would like to experience some onsen towns and I found that the Okuhida Region is a suitable candidate according to our itenary. We are leaving from Matsumoto going to Kanazawa and then well go to Kyoto. I was originally thinking of staying in Takayama for 2 nights but 2 nights in a traditional ryokan with onsens sound just as appealing. In this case we will skip Takayama or just allow some hours only in order to explore it.  So I have two questions. First of all is it worth it to stay in one the ryokans in this area instead of Takayama and secondly I find an extremely limited availability in the ryokans for the days im looking.  Is it normal everything to be booked so early in advance or am I missing something like an annual event? I find availability in just the most luxurious ones which are a little out of my budget. ,Fotis,,"Athens, Greece"

Hello friends!    My boyfriend and I are planning to drive from Narita airport to a hotel in Kawaguchiko area and would like to ask for your kind support to shade some lights in the following please =)    1) How is the road condition from Narita to Kawaguchiko in first week of February? Is snow on the road common during that time of the year?  2) Is it risky to drive in winter? We are experienced drivers in city and mountain areas on normal roads but no experience on snow or icy roads.  3) Is there any other means of transportation you would recomend instead of driving? (Our flight is scheduled to arrive at 11:30am)    Cheers!! ,2jonthemove,Yamanashi Prefecture,"Bangkok, Thailand"

I have read the Visit Japan customs pages which says you must have your receipts & goods ready for inspection.    Then I have read posts here that say they don't ask to see the goods so they can be checked baggage. These posts are pre Covid so wondering if this still stands.    We have liquor that shouldn't be carry on and also our tax free purchases are heavy due to the amazing things we've bought.    Otherwise we're thinking to just check everything & pay the tax if we have to. Is that complicated? ,esptm,Tokyo,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi! We plan to visit Gotokuji temple and will be traveling by train from our hotel in the Ueno area. According to what I’ve found it will be quickest to walk to Yushima station and stay on that train line as if changes to the Odakyu line. We will have day subway passes and it doesn’t seem Odakyu is on the subway line. I read that you can pay a supplemental fee when exiting at Gotokuji. Does anyone know how to do that? Can we just stay on the train and pay a person at the exit or a machine?    Thanks! ,kedelano,Tokyo,"Boston, MA"

Normally I avoid Hakone at the weekends but was asked to do a trip yesterday and got the free pass in advance. Usually weekends are a nightmare.  First the romance cars for a three hour window in the morning were sold-out so obviously a lot of people travelling. Travelling at 7:20 was way too early for my guests and 10:45 you lose most of the day.  Went to Odawara for the castle - requested by guest - I like it nice spot. Picked up some food because options up at Lake Ashi are limited. Opted for the bus to the lake - one per hour - short wait. Had food while waiting (good move).  Weekend traffic - the 7 km trip from Odawara to Hakone-Yumoto took over 90 minutes - you can walk faster. Knowing the traffic would remain bad everywhere - got off bus and returned to Tokyo.  PLUS  Ropeway and access to Owakudani was suspended due to wind. Even if getting to the lake or Gora you'd be stuffed.  Lake Ashi boat was either delayed but more likely not running.  Free Pass cost - 6000 yen value (at a stretch) 3000 yen probably closer to 2500. Expensive day - yes Happy to be out of the traffic - you bet. ,JapanCustomTours,,Japan
I need help figuring out what I should buy for transportation. I am traveling with my family. Two adults and 3 kids all under 6 yrs old. We arrive in NRT about 8pm on Tuesday.

Then going to the Hyatt Regency Tokyo Bay for 3 nights to spend time at Disney parks. Then checking out Tuesday and heading back to NRT to fly home. Given this itinerary what sort of train/subway tickets should I get. Should I buy any prepaid or multiday type tickets. Do I get a JR pass and/or suica pass. Looking for the most convenient and easy type of pass given I have 3 kids with us. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you. ,vinson l,Tokyo,San Francisco...

Hi  any ninja places of interest that i can visit in Mie ? ,sunboyalan,Mie Prefecture,thailand
Hi!  I hv a few questions regarding the Pass:-  1. Aside from the trains that i make reservations for do i just insert the Pass as a ticket when i take the trains or buses?    2. Can i make the train reservations in advance (i suppose atthe green machine or ticket counter) once i collect the Pass even though i don't intend to activate the Pass til a few days later?    3. I understand that the Pass covers the shinkansen only between shin-osaka and hiroshima. Should i want to travel from Kyoto to Hiroshima by shinkansen is there an option to 'top-up' the fare? Or can i only take a different train from kyoto to shin osaka and get on the shinkansen there?    Thank you! ,shineout982,,"Singapore, Singapore"

What would be the approximate walking time from the blue cave illuminations area to Shibuya station?  I see that this year the illumination will incorporate a Christmas market. Based on our experience attending the Osaka Christmas market in 2019 - extremely overcrowded - I’m guessing we should prepare for similar at Shibuya?  Would about 1hr be sufficient to see the illumination?  We did attend on our previous trip in 2019 and the illumination was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING but unfortunately I can’t recall logistical detail and the official website doesn’t mention the distance or walking time from Shibuya station. ,Renee1901,,
I have nearly four weeks in Japan late Feb to late March.  After weeks of research a good portion of that on this forum- thanks everyone-I have most of my schedule decided on and accommodation booked: Tokyo - Kanazawa- Kyoto- Koyasan- Nara - Miyajima will take up eighteen days and I have a couple of nights booked in Tokyo before my flight home.  That leaves me with five nights to fill after Miyajima. I'd love to spend a few days in Okinawa specifically on Zamami. All I'll want to do is relax maybe swim and do a whalewatching trip.  I'm planning on flying Hiroshima to Naha and then back to Tokyo again from there.    Depending on flight and ferry times I know I may have to spend a night in Naha.    My question is about accommodation on Zamami- I'm happy with somewhere simple a minchuku would be fine but there are so few reviews that I'm having a hard time deciding.  Does anyone here have recommendations or general advice?    Thanks in advance! ,Mags C,,
We're travelling to Tokyo for the first time in late December but I'm really unsure about where to stay. It will be and my adult daughter. I really want to hear from people who have travelled there.    I've been told that Ueno is a good location for transport etc. But I also read it's a little dowdy. I was then told about Roppongi which is more high end but not great for transport links.    Essentially we want to stay somewhere vibrant and modern with good quality hotels which aren't super expensive. We also want to get around and visit attractions such as temples spas restaurants and parks etc.    Any advice on this would be extremely helpful.    We haven't been before and want to get this right.    I have looked online but I don't feel like I'm making much progress. I really want to hear from people with first hand experience.

Hi.    I'm aware of new(ish) rules that mean travellers have to book space for their luggage on shinkansens. However it looks like it's only on certain routes. Is the Tokyo-Nagano route affected?

Hello    I will be in Kyoto from 1/25 through 1/29 at which point I had planned on taking a train down to Nagasaki where I would spend three nights. It sounds like a good city to simply walk around but I may also try to see Sotome or Unzen one day and hopefully Gunkanjima Island another day.    Afterwards my thought was to take a train down to Kagoshima where I would spend two or three nights. While here I would rent a car and do one or two day trips (Ibusuki Chiran).    I would then drive over to the southeast coast and spend two or three nights in a nice town or village and do some nice outdoor activities hopefully a little hiking or walking.    At this point the plan was to return the Kagoshima with the car return it board a ferry on 2/6 for Yakushima where I would rent a car there spend 3 nights in the south maybe at the Shikiyonado Inn and hopefully do a little bit of hiking and touring of the island. From there I was thinking of flying from the Yakushima airport to Osaka where I would spend a night and then start my long journey home from Osaka on 2/10.    Given the time of year I will be there I thought it would be wise to stick to the coast and the south of Kyushu. I’m not someone that has to see all the top tourist attractions and museums. I prefer to be in some interesting places that are fun to walk around and observe. I also like to be out in nature whenever possible.    So my question to you folks is could you offer up some advice on possibly how to fill up the gap in my itinerary? I have not yet booked any of the Kyushu (1/29-2/9) part of the trip. Here it is in a simpler format:    1/25 - 1/29 Kyoto  1/29 - 2/1 Nagasaki  2/1 - 2/3 or 2/4 Kagoshima  2/3 or 2/4 - 2/6 ??? (Nichinan coast?)  2/6 - 2/9 Yakushima  Fly to Osaka on 2/9 and home on 2/10    Thank you    Chris (Barry) ,BarryTattle,Kyushu,Boston...

I will have some time to kill at Haneda airport before flying to Fukuoka. In case I can't find the right product at Haneda where shall I go in Fukuoka to buy one? I will stay near Yakushi subway station. Thank you! ,Hikergirlie,,
I'm heading back to Japan next April and I've been looking at getting tickets for the shinkansen on the JR East website. (I know they can only be booked 30 days in advance but I'm just practicing at this point)    But I cannot for the life of me work out how to get a return ticket from Tokyo to Kyoto.    I've seen this other site called Rail Ninja that claims to make it easier. I've managed to find tickets quite easily on there but I was wondering if anyone had used them and if they actually worked?    Or if someone could direct me through using the new JR East Reservation site I'd appreciate it. I know it's the Tokaido Line that goes from the two cities but it doesn't show up on the website. ,Yelkcub97,,United Kingdom
Hi all    I've reviewed all the JR pass stuff. Why do so many people buy it in advance?    I get buying the JR pass in Japan is somewhat more expensive but that pretty much washes out after you factor in shipping and the other surcharges websites charge. And I'm guessing the line to buy one at Haneda is pretty minimal? Either way you have to go there if you to validate your pass even if you pre purchased it. Plus you don't have to worry about losing the thing.    Am I missing something? I'll buy one in advance if so.    Thanks! ,Coleman D,,Minneapolis...
Hi! I will be in Oita for 3.5 full days and I will have 3 families with a few young children ranging from the age of 4 to 12 19 - 22 Nov.

Will appreciate it if suggestions can be made for the must dos and the must haves. Thank you so much in advance. ,Zenalexia,Oita Prefecture,"Singapore, Singapore"
I'm travelling to Japan for a month in winter and realising that (compared with previous summer trips) outer layers and appropriate footwear are going to weigh a bit.. I was thinking to bring some clothes that don't fit me well anymore wear them as outer layers wash them at our hotel and then donate (or discard) before coming home.    Are there op shops or services where tourists can donate or recycle unwanted clothing? For example I read uniqlo had a program to recycle clothes but not sure if this is still active post-covid. Same for op shops - in Australia they were not accepting donations for a couple of years but have since reopened - are there still restrictions in Japan? Alternatively are there appropriate trash bins/services tourists could use without inconveniencing people?    Thanks in advance for any suggestions/help!

Goodness Tokyo planning takes some thinking! Sorry to ask I have the Gate Suite booked at the Gate Hulic in Ginza - with the terrace and hot tub or should we go for a room at the new Bellustar?.

Can someone who ve been to the alpine route advise me on how best to do it. I read it can be done as a day trip.  I will be in Kanazawa .can i make it as a starting point .  There is a tateyama kurobe alpine pass does it cover all the transport including busestrainscable cars from tateyama to ogizawa. Can we stop along the route and is one day enough for the 37 km. do we get down and walk part of the snow wall pls.  At the end in Shinano omachi is there transport to Matsumoto where I hope to stay.  I did look at the pass and tickets but really very confuse. Hope someone can help me.  Thank you.

I see reviews in this forum for Inside Japan tour company mostly dating from before 2017. Has anyone used them in 2023 to organize a self-guided tour for 3-4 weeks duration and have a review they'd like to share?

Hello we are planning to explore Hokkaido as part of our Japan trip and would appreciate some advice. This is our third trip to Japan but first time in Hokkaido and first time with our child.    May 2 - arrive in Tokyo  May 4 - fly to Sapporo explore Sapporo  May 6 - (car hire) make our way to Hakodate stay somewhere halfway overnight?  May 7-9 - explore Hakodate  May 9 - fly from Hakodate to Osaka until 14th (then make our way to Tokyo and fly home)    My questions are:  Is it better to fly into Hakodate and fly back from Sapporo?  Should we break our drive from Sapporo to Hakodate and stay overnight? Or is the drive doable in one day with breaks and stopover with a kid?    We are flexible to add more nights in Hokkaido (ie to do daytrip to Otaru) if this itinerary seem too hectic. ,schirac,Hokkaido,Sydney
We are booking a relatively last minute trip to Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka over the winter holiday season. We arrive into Tokyo on 12/29 and are debating whether to start in Tokyo or head out to Kyoto/Osaka and start our trip there. Are there New Years celebrations or traditions or gatherings in one or the other city that might help us decide? We are a family of 5 - kids ages 15 12 10 - and while we are Korean-American ourselves it's our kids' first time in Asia. ,ektk,,Menlo Park...

Hi all - Looking for opinions on Edo Wonderland.  I'm in the planning stages for a trip in June with 2 adults and 2 older kids (9 and 13). We're not interested in Disney etc. but I thought Edo Wonderland might be more our speed - fun cultural activities. With that said I'm having a hard time deciding if an overnight trip to Nikko from Tokyo is more trouble that Edo Wonderland is worth. This may be a value judgement but interested to hear opinions especially regarding the age-range of the kids.  We're planning to visit Kyoto and Hiroshima otherwise. This would be our only theme park type attraction and I'm mostly interested in the samurai and ninja experiences. ,amanda j,,

Hi everyone.  We are a family of 5 traveling for the first time for to weeks in mid Dec. I’ve been reading about the subway/train tickets we should purchase in advance. My questions are:  1) to move between cities Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka-Tokyo should we get the JC pass or is it better to get each ticket separate?  2) Do we need the subway card for each different city or do we use the same?  3) When should I buy the tickets for the long distance trips? Do we reserve the seats when we buy them or after? Is there an expiration date for them? I understand we can buy the local subway card at Haneda airport on arrival. Is that correct?      My apologies as I’m a bit confused (only a bit 😂) with all the different information online. Thanks for reading. ,MSoca,Tokyo,"Miami, Florida"
Hi all  My husband and I have a trip planned to Japan March 31st -April 17th. We may be able to move our flight up to either March 30th or March 29th. We are looking for thoughts on potential places we can go in between Kyoto and Tokyo.

I'm branching this off from the thread on train ticketing questions. I was hoping for more anecdotes on using the Smart EX app. If you've weighed in earlier no need to repeat verbatim    At the risk of sounding quite dense and beating the issue to death the app looks awkward to use and I'm not sure whether to try it or not. First trip to Japan for me many foreign trips with other QR codes for planes event and museum admissions etc in other countries. I'm seeing:    1) It's necessity to upload credit card - a number of reviews from the App Store have indicated trouble with this (of course those who had no trouble will not generally post positives)    2) the need to use a password to display the phone QR code - from the Smart EX page - https://smart-ex.jp/en/entraining/qr/display/ . Hard to imagine I've never used a password to send a QR code to Apple wallet.    3) suggestions to print out the tickets on the Smart EX page - no printer for me when traveling - if I'm chasing a printer down I might as well just stand in line at a ticket counter.    I suspect using a laptop might be easier. I will consider this from home 30 days in advance for a couple tickets but this negates the advantage of using the app close to the travel date as more factors influencing departure time are known. Perhaps I will download the app and explore as a back-up for long counter lines.    Concept of Smart EX sounds great - I'm just not convinced that the actual usage is hassle-free. ,Europelover2014,,"Chicago, Illinois"
Hello to experts here!    This is my first trip to Japan and will be visiting Tokyo in December 2023. I am suffering from arthritis in my knees and also will have luggages so hope I can seek some advice from experts here.    These are the questions I have:  1) My family of 4 adults will be arriving in Narita Airport Terminal 1. My accommodation will be at Mimaru Asakusa. Can I know besides taxi what public transport will be easiest and direct (with escalators and elevators) for me to use? How do I purchase tickets for these?    2) How do I buy suica cards? We do not have iPhones at all. Basically I will just be travelling (Asakusa as the base) to Yokohama Shibuya Harajuku Shinjuku Nihonbashi Tsukiji and nearby places. Besides suica cards are there any other cards available for my family to use?    Thank you to everyone here. ,Michelle9279,Tokyo,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hello All    We are planning a trip last week of November ( 4 days Tokyo 6 days Kyoto/Osaka) and would like to add a one day trip to Hakone.    Our plan is to include it on our way to Osaka from Tokyo.    We already purchased the JR pass.    Tokyo -> JR pass Odawara -> Hakone -> Odawara -> Shin Osaka    Is this achievable in a day and still see main attractions in Hakone ( Ropeway Train Pirate ship Lake Ashi Mt Fuji view Museum etc). We are not keen on onsen experience.    What time should we start from Tokyo and what time to leave from Hakon in order to reach Shin Osaka by night.    Can we store the luggage at Odawara station and pick them in the evening when going to Osaka?    I do understand an overnight stay is better but I cannot accommodate that now.    Thanks for the suggestions. ,TinkerbellSchool,Hakone-machi,
Hi    Below is my itinerary for my upcoming trip in the last 2 weeks of Dec '23. We are a family of 4. Kids are 7 and 13. I would like to ask for advice on:    1. Based on the plan for Kyoto should I get day passes or pay per trip?  2. For Day 6 Kyoto is it feasible to experience all of them for that day (based on crowds entry queues getting around by public transportation)?  3. For Day 6 and 7 Kyoto are these places correctly grouped for each day for ease of getting around?  4. Do people rent traditional costumes for photography in winter or is it too cold to do so? i.e. around Fushimi-Inari area.  5. Any good suggestions for a doable day trip to see traditional villages? We have planned on Miyama for now.    Day 1 to 4 - Osaka city USJ Nara (day trip)    Day 5 - Kyoto (PM)  - Kyoto no Fukurou no Mori (Kyoto Owl Forest)  - Samurai and Ninja Museum  - Gion    Day 6 - Kyoto  - Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine (do people rent the traditional costume in winter or is it too cold?)  - Kiyomizu-dera temple  - Eikando Temple  - Nijo Castle  - Kyoto Imperial Palace  - Kinkaku-ji  (Not sure if there are too many places planned for this day?)    Day 7 - Kyoto  - Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (go early)  - Arashiyama Monkey Park  - Tenryuji Temple  - Kyoto Railway Museum  - Sannenzaka Ninenzaka    Day 8 - Miyama (Day Trip)    Day 9 to 12 - Nozawaonsen Ski Village (booked)    Day 13 - Osaka    Thanks for any advice on my questions or any other input on this plan. ,LambShanks,Kyoto,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi everyone  First time visitor to Tokyo Disney in January. I've been scoping out bookings for their show restaurants on the app and their website. Their system seems to be constantly under pressure once the daily reservations open. Is it literally a matter of sitting there refreshing as many devices as possible to try to secure a booking or is there perhaps something wrong at my end? I'm not currently in Japan.  When you're in the actual park how does the app perform for priority pass/ entry requests and the like? Do many people experience crashing for that on the day while they are there?

Second time to Kyoto in the last 4 years mid December for 5 days! We are super excited and are staying in Gion in a traditional Japanese home. The last time we came we found it difficult to find restaurants without a reservation so I have started to book dinner reservations. I have one at Kikyo Sushi but thats it. Every time I look for further restaurants I get a little overwhelmed especially at the price (most popular ones on Youtube local lists etc are at least $85pp). We are traveling with our teen so the thought of spending upwards of $300 on a meal every night is intimidating.    Anyone have any moderately priced (more like $50 to $60) restaurants that accept reservations that you love? Looking for yakitori tempura and whatever else you would recommend. Even another sushi spot although I realize a lower price point that $80 or so is probably a no-go. Thanks for any help! ,Beth K,Kyoto,

Hello!  We are arriving into Tokyo and traveling to Kyoto and Osaka from November 20-27. I am seeing that the forecast for the next 10 days seems to not indicate too much rain. We will still take small travel umbrellas but want to avoid packing heavy if possible. Does everyone still recommend bringing some kind of waterproof boot/shoe? Should we be okay with regular walking shoes? We are bringing jackets anyways so the only real question is whether to pack extra waterproof boots or leave them at home.

I am travelling around Japan on a cruise and Aomori will be the first of many ports. I am going through all the excursions offered by the ship for the various ports of call. They are very expensive so I am being very selective with choices. Many of the tours make a “feature” of including free time or shopping time which I think is a bit of a joke when you are paying a fortune for something that costs them nothing.    The idea of this post is to see places where it is worth exploring on foot around the port area or travel by local transport to places of interest. I prefer this than being part of a large group. Knowing Japan is very punctual with public transport means I can assure I will be back onboard in time for departure. My only concern will be conversing in English as I don’t speak Japanese. I will endeavour to learn a few phrases before I go.    Any suggestions would be most appreciated.    Thanks. Carol. ,Carol D,Aomori,"Perth, Australia"
About 1.5 weeks into a 4 week trip. I knew I would love Japan and it has exceeded my expectations. I thought I would put together a summary of general trip information that would be helpful to most people. For reference my wife and I are mid 50s experienced travelers and tend to spend more money for efficiency.    Visit Japan web - complete your immigration and customs paperwork ahead of time. Saves a lot of time on arrival especially customs where you can use the automatic gates. Save a copy on your phone in case WiFi is not available in the terminal.    Digital suica - loaded one on my iPhone and one on my wife’s iPhone. Link to a Mastercard or Amex. I did not have one so I signed up for apple’s credit card which is a Mastercard and is free with no foreign transaction fees. I shared the card with my wife to fund hers. This can be funded when you are still in the US. You can add more funds from your phone in seconds. With an iPhone you set the suica as your default transit card. You walk up to the entry gate at any station wave your phone over the pad and walk right in. Need a drink? Just walk up to many vending machines and wave your phone over the reader. Drink pops right out.    Esim - Ubigi is the way to go. Great coverage even out in the mountains. Bought 100 minutes of Skype for $4 so I can make a few outbound calls to Japanese numbers. I am averaging 2 gb per week without streaming. Heavy usage when out and about. WiFi in hotel. Pocket wifi is too limiting and something else to carry. Just get the esim for data and never be without google maps and google translate.    Train trips in Tokyo - 6 days. Did not bother with a pass. Each trip is only $1.50 - $2.50. There are multiple transport providers in the city. Suica worked on them all. public transport has English signage everywhere. Tokyo is a web of transport options but not difficult to navigate.if you have used the system in Paris or New York you can handle Tokyo. Google maps is your friend. However it is not always the most efficient route so it pays to double check to see if the route makes sense. Love the fact they tell you the platform as well as the best exit since the stations are huge. Note that best exit might have a lot of stairs. Also great for walking directions and driving directions.    Train trips long distance - pass not worth it. I bought all of my tickets ahead of time and reserved seats. Why? Because it was one less thing for me to worry about when moving around the country. The JR websites are confusing but usable. Download the Suica app to your phone to get the serial number of your card. Then you can get an e-ticket on JR and tie it to your suica. Walk up to the JR gate and wa e your phone over the pad. smart-ex for Shinkansen trips is much better organized. The thunderbird train (not part of JR) did not allow e-tix so those have to be picked up at the station.    Luggage delivery - what an awesome service. So far has been flawless. If you are staying in hotels they take care of everything for you. Costs about $25 - $30 total to ship two medium bags overnight. The receiving hotel puts them in your room. There are many many stairs here. Drop off first am and it shows up the next day. At Narita there are two kiosks for jal and Yamato as you walk to the train station. Used Yamato since they could deliver next day.    Language barriers - while there is a lot less English spoken herethere is more than I expected reading various travel forums. People are incredibly friendly and helpful. Google translate is amazing for reading signs menus and communicating with people. I have had waiters and other service people take out there phone and have a conversation with me using google translate. When you speak use simple phases and make sure that they are clear when you mean.    Car rental - we rented a car from budget at Nagano ahead of time. Arrived at the station called their office and the guy said wait by the bus stop and he will pick us up. He was there in under 10 mins. Car paperwork was easy. Get the etc card from budget for electronic tolls some tolls are still cash so have coins available. You will pay the tolls to budget when you return the car and they read the etc. you must have an IDP so get it from AAA before you leave home. Driving was easy most signs are in English. You need a car when driving to smaller towns.    Stay tuned for part 2 ,Lenny2299,,Washington DC...

I need to leave a large suitcase for a week in central Tokyo preferably near or at the main station. I know the lockers at the station are only for 3 days and in past experience hard to get.

We are 4 people getting into HND after 6pm. I was initially going to take the limo line to TCAT but seems it might take a while to get there vs potentially taking a cab and getting to hotel in about 15min as our hotel is close to TCAT?    Thought on pros and cons on cost (cost of cab higher but we are paying for 4 limo rides) vs time of cab (getting to hotel faster)? Is traffic bad around 7pm so will actually be longer to get into city?    As we are already getting in late I’m hoping to at least get some dinner before sleeping off our long day of travel. ,Chartreuse,,

I´ll be traveling to Japan in first half of december for 15 days and I´m wondering what kind of luggage would be most advisable to travel with. I´ll be traveling through different places via trains (mostly using JR Pass). Tokyo-Nagasaki-Osaka-Tokyo.    Would you recommend that I would rather bring a backpack than a suitcase? ,Neeti,,"New Delhi, India"

Hello everyone    We are planning to go from Yamagata to Hakodate with a stop in Sendai station for 1 hour. Unfortunately I only have one hour to spare and the train arrives before 10am. Are there any restaurants in the station that serves Gyutan-Don in the morning?    From what I saw online they mostly open at 11am and there is one that open at 10am. But who knows I might get lucky.    Thanks for reading and any information will be appreciated. ,Stefzzz,Sendai,"Jakarta, Indonesia"

We are flying in to Fukuoka from Singapore on 24 Oct. and intend to stay for 5/6 nights before flying back. The exact flight booking will depend if we need 5 or 6 nights. Both of us like scenery enjoy japanese food and onsen and intend to hire a car. This is our first visit to Kyushu as we have only been to Osaka Kyoto and Hokkaido.  Due to last minute planning of the trip we have in mind the following:    1)Pick up rental car in Fukuoka airport upon arrival in morning and driving to Yufuin;  2)Stay 1 or 2 nights in Yufuin enjoy onsen resort and tour the floral village;  3)Drive to Beppu and perhaps stay one night;  4)Return to Fukuoka and stay 2 or 3 nights.    Are there any other places of interest to visit for scenery or attractions that we missed?  Would it be advisable to return the car in Beppu or Yufuin or drive back to Fukuoka city to return it? ,julie a,Fukuoka,singapore
Hi need advice on driving in Kyushu. We are travelling to Okinawa and then to Kyushu from 5-16 Dec. We have done it for Okinawa self-drive first time in Kyushu was previously on guided tour.  Our first self-drive in Kyushu do we need to chain lock the wheels for these areas we are embarking ? If going by Fukuoka Airport Kurume Kumamoto Kagoshima Miyahzaki Oita then back to Fukuoka Airport areas?    Grateful for advice. And how do we do it if we need to chain lock?

Hi! Our flight return US departs Haneda airport at 00:50 (pretty much 12:50am) on Dec 31 meaning we need to be at airport by 9? 10? pm on Dec 30th. I can’t decide if we should spend the last night in Tokyo to make our trip to airport easier (less travel less stress). Or stay in Kyoto the last night (to have more time In Kyoto) and go straight to Haneda in the afternoon. I looked up Google map it’s about a 3 hour trip?      We are family of 3 kid is 9 year old. M husband and kid do better in less hussel and bussel environment that is why I’m leaning a bit towards staying last night in Kyotobut not sure if this will add on extra stress the next day try to catch train to get to Tokyo. I fully understand this all comes down to personal preference. Hearing folk’s experience will help me figure out what we need to do.    Anyone traveled from Kyoto straight to airport? Just want to check here if it’s easy as Google map directions show 😄. Will it be crazy busy on the 30th heading into Tokyo? ,winnie8805,,San Diego...
I've being putting off posting this for a while because I don't want to come across as needing to be spoon-fed but I really need your help.  I've booked 3 weeks in Japan but not yet booked any accommodation because I don't know where I'll be spending it.  I'm a single male traveller 40 flying into Tokyo on 23rd March and flying out of Tokyo on 13th April.  This will be my 2nd trip to Japan having previously spent 1 week in Tokyo and 1 week in Kyoto with day trip to Osaka.  I will be arriving during what I hope will be full bloom in Tokyo (though I realise I could have missed it by the time I arrive).  I would like to spend a few days in Tokyo (maybe 5 days) and see the sakura in other cities but not just make the trip about following the sakura trail. Does it make sense to head to Kyushu after Tokyo?  I just don't know which cities to focus on because there is so much to see in Japan!  I would like to visit other cities of significance like Hiroshima but I don't have it clear in my mind how long to spend in each city and I want to cover as much ground as possible.  I would really really appreciate a steer in the right direction. ,filthiestfish,,"Croydon, United..."
I'm planning this route on an evening in perhaps October but I noticed all the routes have an extremely tight transfer time at Takeo-Onsen (3 or 4 mins). Otherwise its 45-60 mins until the next one.    Is this by design? Are they synced this way?    Thanks ,Steptoad,Nagasaki,United Kingdom
We'll be in Japan for 2 weeks in February 2024. We're only planning a couple of long distance train trips so I've plugged them into a calculator and determined the JR pass doesn't make sense for us.    However I'm not sure if we need to book the trains in advance or if there's no chance they sell out? We won't have heaps of flexibility in our dates because we've booked hotels already.    If we book them in advance I'm having some trouble figuring out how to do so because it seems you need a physical ticket. I've found some third party websites that sell tickets and either mail them to your home town before you leave or you can pick up from a post office or hotel in Japan. Is that the only way to go?    The specific train trips we're looking to take are:  - Tokyo to Nagano then shuttle to Hakuba  - Shuttle from Hakuba to Nagano then Nagano to Kyoto with a change in Nagoya (this is the one I'm most concerned about getting right as we will need to make sure the times roughly line up and I'm not sure how big the station is at Nagano and whether we can book a ticket when we arrive.  - Kyoto to Tokyo looks like there are a lot of trains ,Cookie,,"Sydney, Australia"
Sorry but I keep getting conflicting info from different websites. Do I need to fill out any visiting visa forms if I'm only going to be in Japan for a week visiting from the US?

Hello    We are traveling to Japan in May and our first stop will be Hakone. Although we will be purchasing a JR pass for the rest of our trip it seems that the only direct (and fastest) option from Tokyo to Hakone is with Odakyu Railway which operates between Tokyo's Shinjuku Station and Hakone-Yumoto Station on the romance car. My problem is that I am finding the online timetables impossible to read. I would appreciate any help in deciphering this (and frankly other) timetables. We are experienced travelers and often use trains and other public transportation to get around but these are really difficult for us to understand given that they are in Japanese characters (which of course is expected). Any tips from others who have successfully navigated the system would be welcomed.    Thanks! ,neverenoughtime,,San Francisco

I am helping my daughter and her husband organise their two weeks in Japan and of course they'd like to stay in Kyoto - from 27th - 30th March - such a busy time!!  We my husband and I usually stay in Toyoko Inns or similar but all of these are booked out for that time as are most reasonably priced places. I have listed everything I can find for them and would like the to be able to pay less than AUD$200 per night but it's really hard.  Can anyone recommend an area they could stay not too far away with good transport options and travel into Kyoto each day?  Alternatively does anyone have suggestions for these criteria:  **good beds - both have back issues and simply can't do futons on the floor  **near to varied food options (one doesn't eat fish or seaweed and the other is gluten intolerant - it **would be lovely to have a kitchenette...  Of course there are other things they'd love but these are the most basic.  I thought I'd found a miraculous price but it turned out to be for one night!!

Hello Japan experts! I am trying to book a train from Kyoto to Odawara for late December and then Odawara to Tokyo. It is more than 30 days ahead but the Smart-EX website/app allows you to make a reservation now for certain routes. While I have been able to book the oversized bags on other segments successfully there is nothing coming up for any time of day on these segments. I'm not sure if that's because there are no seats left if they haven't been released yet or if there are no oversized baggage areas on these trains. For example on December 28 Hikari 662 has seats available at 18:33 but when you select oversized baggage no trains appear. None of the other trains that day seem to let you choose oversized bags either.    I have read that you can pay a penalty of 1000 yen per oversized bag if you haven't reserved the seats with extra baggage space but how does this penalty actually work? I.e. do you get barred from entering the train? Do you pay it in advance? Or is that just a scare tactic and people bring their bags on anyways without penalty?    Just trying to figure out if I should be booking this now or waiting until 30 days prior to see if these oversized seats open up. But given that I'm travelling to Tokyo on December 29 just before New Year's I'm nervous to wait.    Thanks in advance for your advice! ,Some_tips_for_ya,,"Toronto, Canada"

HI!  I am working on a trip to Japan and Korea with family in October. We'd split our time over two weeks starting in Japan then on to Korea.

This community is always so helpful in sending feedback and so sharing a recap of our 6-day adventure in Kyushu after spending a week exploring Tokyo Kyoto Kagoshima and Hiroshima. We decided to self-drive (Toyota rent-a-car) from Fukuoka to Kagoshima.    Day 1: Started in Fukuoka and headed to Kurokawa Onsen. Splurged on a fantastic ryokan at Kurokawaso. It was worth every penny with beautiful baths and a fantastic 9 course dinner. Many people buy an onsen pass to get them into many onsens in the main town however the onsen here is so nice we didn't feel any need.    Day 2: Drove to Mt. Aso and did the Mt. Nakadake/Takadake Hike (6miles). Then drove to Takachiho where we stayed at Hotel Grateful Takachiho (cheap clean). The town itself wasn't anything to write home about    Day 3: We were particularly excited about visiting Takachiho Gorge but it turned out to be a bit underwhelming. It's beautiful but tiny and there are larger more impressive gorges out there in my opinion. We chose not to do the boat ride due to the 3.5-hour wait which didn't seem worth it.    Next the coastal drive from Aoshima to Obi was stunning. The infrastructure around it seems very outdated/abonded. Obi made for a nice overnight stop. There are numerous ryokens here but were out of our budget.    Day 4: Continued along the scenic coast to Cape Toi. Next went inland to Kirishima Kinko Wan National Park and stayed at Kirishima Kokusai Hotel. Next time we would just stay in Kagoshima and do a day trip the hotel was clean but it was big with lots of people had a big buffet and wasn't to our personal taste.    Day 5: Hiked to Omani-ike crater lake would recommend you walk around the whole lake (vs the initial you viewpoint you see if you just hike up to the lake and back). We preferred this hike to Mt Aso.    We then drove to Kagoshima we made sure to catch the sunset at Sakurajima. The short ferry ride was delightful and the free Sakurajima Nagisa Foot Bath Spa was a fun experience as we gazed at the mountain and the Kagoshima sunset. We found Sakurajima to be the most beautiful of all the volcanoes we encountered offering a distinctive perspective from a distance compared to the closer experiences at Aso and Kirishima Kinko Wan National Park. Kagoshima itself was a small and walkable city and although we had limited time we wish we had arrived earlier in the day to explore Sakurajima more extensively.    Our accommodation for the night was at the Daiwa Roynet Hotel a clean economical and centrally located option.    Day 6: A short walk to Shiriyama Park viewpoint and a stop at Sengen-en gardens before flying back to Tokyo.While the gardens were pleasant they didn't stand out as a must-see in our eyes.    Note:  If we had more time we'd have explored Yakushima and Nagasaki.    Self-driving offered us a glimpse into authentic Japanese life as Kyushu is less touristy than other parts of the country. Many restaurants didn't have an English menu which added to the surprise of a meal.    We visited in late October booking each hotel the night before. ,anna292018,,"Seattle, Washington"

Hey TAs    I have decided to visited either one the places mentioned. I am a nature person who enjoys quiet serene nature landscape. I am targeting end of Nov after my conference in Tokyo. I have 3 free days. I don't have a JR pass but will buy Shinkansen tickets anytime.  I would like to know which 3 places mentioned in the Tohoku region is most scenic perhaps I don't mind a day trip out as I typically will use these areas as a base. I am a solo traveller and like to blend into the cultures of locals by visiting off-beaten track. Touristy places are a no-no for me.  Please advice    Thanks ,Raymond H,,Malaysia

Traveling to Tokyo the last week of January for 10 days (then off to Kyoto) with husband and 1 year old. I’m not sure where to stay between the two. I have a short list of pros and I’m sure there are things I’m not considering that I should in regards to location.    Asakusa:  - limo bus drops you off in front of the Asakusa View  - close to Sensoji and Ueno  - more residential from what I’ve read so easier to find child friendly restaurants?    Mimaru:  - more “central” anticipate easier to get back to hotel when visiting west and southern Tokyo  - large room with kitchen ideal with toddler    We plan on taking it slow and have Disneyland and Mount Fuji via Fuji excursion limited express on our to do. Other interests include: Aquarium teamlab temples DisneySea if Disneyland is a hit and Asabono. We just want to walk around neighborhoods maybe visit museums and just kind of treat most days like a Sunday adventure. I don’t think we can wrong with either place but just curious what the general opinion is since it’ll be January and I’ll have a 1 year old. ,mihiro,Tokyo,San Diego...
My partner and I will be in Takayama from Dec 3-6 and would like to visit Kamikochi if the weather forecast is good while we're there. We're hikers and we're fully prepared to walk through the tunnels. We will bring winter-wear microspikes and head lamps.    My question is about the registration forms at Nakanoyu gate. I'm guessing they will be fully in Japanese could someone please give me an idea of how to fill out the forms? Are there blank forms available at the gate?  Also will the gate attendants give us any trouble trying to walk through the tunnel?    We're planning to take the bus to and from Nakanoyu. Based on the bus time table it seems we'll have about 5 hours maximum to spend in the park is that a reasonable amount of time to walk to Kappa Bridge and back to Nakanoyu? ,Olivia R,Kamikochi,

Hello TA friends    I'll be travelling to Hokkaido next week with all my hotels and rented car booked. While checking AccuWeather I noticed there is snow forecasted for areas like Furano and Biei. I would like to seek your advice on whether snowy/icy road conditions will be likely for my following itinerary:    30 Oct: Pick up rental car from Sapporo (Times Car Rental)  30 Oct - 1 Nov: Lake Toya  1-3 Nov: Noboribetsu  3-5 Nov: Furano Biei  5-6 Nov: Obihiro  6 Nov: Drive back to Sapporo and return car    Based on the weather conditions in Hokkaido now do you think there will be snowy or icy road conditions during this period? I had not expected that as I thought snow would arrive later in November. :/    In addition may I also check two other things:    (1) Which if any parts of this itinerary will have challenging driving conditions? For example high-altitude or narrow/winding roads. I have experience driving such roads (in Australia New Zealand) but just want to know ahead of time to be mentally prepared especially if the sides of the roads involve steep drops.    (2) Will it make sense for me to get the Hokkaido Expressway Pass or will it be cheaper to pay as I go using the ETC?    Grateful for all the advice and tips you can give. Thanks in advance!

I fairly well finalised my itinerary plus list of trains etc that work best with what we have planned back in September.

We travel to Hiroshima next week - will take the NEX from Narita to Shinagawa to get to Hiroshima. We bought the JP Pass before the price increase and will use for the shinkansen trains. Will spend 2 nights in Hiroshima and then take the shinkansen to Tokyo (Shunjuku).    On Nov 19 there is only 1 Hikari train to Shinagawa. Rest reschedules are Nozomi which we cannot take.    I found an article that says JR Pass holders can pay extra to ride on Nozomi. Is this correct?

Taxi stand on the north side of Kyoto Station which is what we want. But it appears there are two exits on that side labeled Karasuma Higashi and Karasuma Chou. Are they on different level?

Hi we’ll be in Ueno/Tokyo a few nights before skiing Hakuba in mid January and my head hurts with over reading how best to travel and what needs booking.    We’ll send ski luggage (clothes only) directly to Hakuba when we arrive at Haneda Airport and after our 5 days go by Shinkansen/bus to Hakuba.    On way home however with 48 hours for luggage transport and our flight being 9.30pm the night we leave Hakuba should we:    A) travel with luggage on Shinkansen (we’re all adults no skis/boots but a suitcase plus overnight bag each and 10 of us) or    B) send luggage on and do something like snow monkey tour in last 2 days when we can’t ski or    C) travel by bus to Haneda with luggage    All/any advice including booking of transport/websites welcome as our first trip and it’s overwhelming!

Hello everyone.    My husband and I have an upcoming trip to Japan beginning 27th December for 7 weeks and I have some questions relating to our itinerary that I was hoping somebody could help me with please. Here is the itinerary for the Chugoku leg of our trip and the questions follow:    Dec 28th Arrive at Okayama from Tokyo  Dec 29th Naoshima Island  Dec 30th Naoshima Island  Dec 31st Takamatsu  Jan 1st Takamatsu - visit Ritsurin Garden  Jan 2nd Matsuyama  Jan 3rd Matsuyama - visit Dogo Onsen  Jan 4th Hiroshima -  Jan 5th Hiroshima - Peace Museum & Park  Jan 6th HIroshima  Jan 7th Miyajima Island  Jan 8th Miyajima Island  Jan 9th Osaka  Jan 10th Osaka  Jan 11th Osaka  Jan 12th - leaving for Nozawa Onsen    My questions are:    Is it easy to travel between Takamatsu and Matsuyama by train during this New Year period?    Ritsurin Gardens is on my bucket list and I don't have have anything else planned at this stage in Takamatsu so I'm wondering if we might only stay one night there and add an extra night into one of my other places on the list? But is that too rushed?    Does our itinerary seem ok? We've been to Japan a couple of times before and usually travel at a really slow pace so this seems super fast compared to what we're used to. We have accommodation booked in Nozawa Onsen for a month beginning January 12th hence why we only a have small window for these destinations.

Hi everyone    Unfortunately my mobile can't take an esim so I will be using a physical sim for my upcoming trip to Japan.    I am wondering if anyone in Australia can recommend a physical sim that I can buy before I go. I'm considering putting the Japan sim in my old phone and taking 2 phones.    I was going to buy a physical sim on arrival in Tokyo (Haneda) but as we will arrive late and need to exchange our JR passes I was wondering if it's possible to arrange the sim card before leaving home.

Hi we are arriving in KIX at 6pm on 20 Dec and need to get to Namba station. I understand Nankai train is way to go. Just a few questions is there a way to buy discounted rapid or normal Nankai tix before we arrive?  Also we have a JR pass but don't want to activate it until 22 Dec (to allow full 21 days usage so it will cover last day in Japan on 11 Jan). That means for arrival night and the next full day on 21 Dec we need to just buy individual tickets to get around before we can start using JR pass on last day in Osaka (i.e. 22 Dec). Is just using ICOCA card our best bet for day 1 and 2 or is there a full day pass we can buy for 21 Dec?. thx ,The_Vedas,Osaka Prefecture,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi all! Thank you in advance for your advice. We will be in Osaka at New Years and we know a lot of stuff will be closed 1/1 and 1/2. We are trying to plan our itinerary and are thinking of Nara in 1/1. I understand the temples will be open and it will be busy but will restaurants/shops be open as well? Would 1/2 be a better day to visit if we also want to visit shops/restaurants? Thanks so much. ,decca_mac,Nara,nyc
Do these areas have closed/rest days? I'm not talking about the public baths but rather the shops/restaurants/attractions? I've been looking but can't seem to find a definite answer. We went to Kinosaki Onsen in June and didn't realize that Wednesday was that day for them. Although I enjoyed the peacefulness - it felt like having the town to ourselves very little shops and restaurants were open. Having to leave the next day early it felt like I missed out on the hustle/bustle .... very limited to what we could experience.

Hi  Hoping for any advice on an itinerary for 2 days in Kyoto with a 4.5 year old (good with walking distances) and grandparents in their late 70s (with walking limitations). When we arrive by train on Nov 19th AM should we store our luggage at Kyoto Station or take them to the hotel? (Our hotel is 12 min walk north of Kyoto station.)    On Nov 20th we will have a driver. The other day we will use trains or taxis. We would like to visit 1-2 temples (ideally with scenic foliage!) Nishiki market Gion Fushimi Inari Shrine and Kyoto Railway Museum. Open to other suggestions and alternatives. I know this is really pushing it but if there is room for a half day in Nara I'd love to do that too.

As far as I can see from Google images there is a landing permission sticker which a UK citizen would get on arrival for a tourist visit and a smaller exit stamp put close to it. I can't see any entry stamp so I suppose the landing permission sticker serves as an entry stamp.  Now I basically only have 1½ pages left in my passport so could someone tell me the exact dimensions of the landing permission sticker in cm or inches? I think it would fit in the half page but I'd like to be quite sure.  The next question is more difficult! Assuming that it will fit on the half page is there a good chance that the immigration officer (at Sapporo airport) will put it there if I ask him/her? Can I assume that he/she will understand the sentence Please put the landing permission sticker here? while I hold up my passport pointing to the half page before I hand it over to him? ,Paul F,,

We're staying near the Nakiyama ski area in Feb 2024 and I've taken a look at the webshop site but I'm not too sure on the best way for us to sort the lift passes.    We're there for 7 nights and we think we want to ski for 5 days (our first and last day will mostly be travel and that gives us one rest day in the middle for a day trip to the snow monkeys).    Looking at the webshop theres only pricing for 1 and 2 day passes and I don't think they can be booked yet anyway. Is it best to just book multiple sets of the 1 day ticket? Are there options that don't include the whole mountain that are cheaper? When will day tickets / shorter term passes be available for booking on the website? Is there any risk if we just wait til we arrive that tickets will be sold out or can we just book at the ticket window?    Is there anywhere to hire skis / equipment around the Nakiyama lift area?

I'm travelling from Takayama and planning on staying in one of the Ryokans in Okuhida Onsen after visiting Shinhotaka Ropeway ... is there a place I can store my luggage at Shinhotaka Ropeway? The official website doesn't have any info and anecdotally on travel blogs I've heard conflicting things - some say you can store luggage there for a small fee others say not. Can anyone confirm? I'll be travelling with one carry-on suitcase and one medium sized backpack.  Also is Hirayu Onsen the best area to stay in the Okuhida region? ,travelLTN,,"Melbourne, Australia"

We plan to arrive at Shibuya station on the Narita Exp and would need to go the Shibuya Tokyo REI Hotel. I read that the Miyamasuzaka or East Exit would suit us for going up to Meiji Street.  Since we would have some luggage would like to confirm that there are escalators / elevators on the way from the Narita Express platform (I believe it is Platform 4) to the Miyamasuzaka exit.

Will waiting for checked bags slow down our passage through I migration and Customs at Narita?    I ask because here in Seattle it does exactly that—-we had to wait 15 minutes for our checked bags before we could proceed to immigration and customs.    As we are proceeding to Kyoto by Narita Express and Nozomi after our 16:35 ( scheduled) arrival we hope to get through as quickly as possible. I see Narita Express departures at 17:17 (which I expect we will miss) and 17:46. If we do not make that one it is hour of waiting for the next.    We will be flying Business Class so near the front of the plane and that should help. But not if we have to wait a long time for checked bags!    We will have the QR codes from Visit Japan web. And our bags are carry-on size so we could do that is it is to our advantage. We are only thinking of checking bags so we can bring hiking poles for the Kumano Kodo trek but maybe we can do without them.    Thank you for your help. ,Enzian,,Seattle

Myself and 2 friends arrive in Tokyo on a cruise ship in April for 2 days. We believe the port is an hours travel from Central Tokyo. We are not keen on the shore tours the cruise ship has to offer and would like to get into Tokyo and leave later in the evening to get back to the ship. We are not sure what transport options there are to get us into town and back possibly late at night. Can anyone advise if there are trains nearby or what other options there are? Also things to see in town. Thanks! ,Dinezey,Tokyo,"Hamilton, New..."

I've seen some posts asking about food tours but no responses (at least nothing recent within the last few years). From Google searches I've come across food tour experiences available through Airbnb and Viator and this one which looks local (https://osakafoodtours.com/) but would love to get a reference from someone who has used one of these services!

Hi    I'll be in Tokyo for around 6 weeks around late March 2024 - early May 2024. Time is somewhat flexible. I'll basically need WiFi a desk and a bed as the bare minimum. Fridge would be nice. Preferably I'll be located somewhere around the Tokyo Dome area (Bunkyo I guess). This is flexible as well but I don't want to end up way outside the city. I don't have plans to do a lot of travel around Japan that's for another time. I don't speak enough Japanese to communicate well with anyone still in the learning process.    Here's my questions. Not sure what kind of accommodation I should chose. A hotel for that long a time seems too pricy. I thought about renting a furnished apartment but think it's quite a hassle to do this for only 6 weeks. Then there are home stays. This would be quite a cool option but I see the language problem.    So I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions here. Thanks in advance.    Best regards  Chuck ,Chuck,Tokyo,
I think I'm going to get the Ubigi or Airalo esims to move around. How much data do you think I need for 7 days in Japan? I see 3G or 10G type plans mostly I would need it for mapping and train schedules. I also assume most hotels have wifi I can tap into? We would likely get 2-4 esims for me and my husband and maybe each for 2 kids...given that many phones what would you recommend? 3G each enough? ,Chartreuse,,
I have completed the forms (on my laptop) and immediately received the QR codes. However I didn't print them off immediately (big mistake) but just took screenshots. I assumed that I could access them at any time by logging on to the site again. Is this possible? There doesn't seem to be any option to access them. There also didn't seem to be a definite end confirmation. Is this correct?  Apologies if these are dim questions.  Thanks in advance! ,Kim,,"Sunderland, Tyne..."
Hey all    I'm traveling from the UK to see Japan for six days. It's been my dream to go and I am very excited.    I've done a lot of research and this hotel is connected directly to a train station has local amenities and has very nice views too which I am most after. However it's a fair distance from my airport (Haneda) and also is far from Shibuya and Shinjuku (I am very interested in the nightlife and the views at night). I also want to do lots of tours etc and I'm just checking I can do all of these from here as I have looked at hotels in the mentioned areas and they tend to be significantly more expensive/smaller rooms.    Thanks for your time ,Jack Murrell,Taito,
Would love to hear input and any advice from folks who have experience in the area. We would be spending 3 days in Hong Kong so hopefully the jet lag and time change from San Francisco will have dissipated. We would be arriving in Osaka Sunday March 24th around 5pm. Flight has not been booked so we can easily come in earlier if that makes sense.    3/24 -3/26 Osaka  3/26-3/29 Kumano Kodo hike  3/29- 3/31 Kyoto  3/31 - 4/1 Kanazawa  4/1 - 4/4 Tokyo    Is that time schedule reasonable? Expecting to hopefully take bullet trains between major destinations. Traveling just the two of us a middle-aged couple that loves hiking great food and historic sites. Any input on the Kumano Kodo (which section to do if we only have 3 nights of the Nakahechi portion) is greatly appreciated. Budget is not of concern we will be using points for most of our hotels. ,RafalP123,,"Concord, California"

Aloha we are a family of three including our 4 year old daughter traveling to Japan in late February 2024 from Hawaii. We will be visiting a few cities and finishing in Tokyo for 4 nights after staying at Disney for 3. The other cities were a little easier for me to choose our accommodations but Tokyo seems a bit bigger and a little overwhelming.    We like bigger apartment style hotel rooms with the convenience of a concierge and on site staff. I think I’ve narrowed our stay down to either mimaru Tokyo akasaka or Monday apart premium nohonbashi. We want to be a little outside of the hustle and bustle of shinjuku and Shibuya yet close enough and easily accessible to explore as we choose. Anyone with experience at these locations or similar accommodation suggestions would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much!!! ,jkfrank808,,"Kailua, Hawaii"

Hello    I will be in Shibuya for two days as a layover. I am wondering how much I should bring. Other posts seem more for people with a different travel style than me.    -I don't rest much during vacations so I usually have excursions every day.    - I like sit-down dinners and street food for lunch and sometimes breakfast.      -I like tours as well as visiting neighboring cities.    -I love souvenirs and I have to get one for everyone usually food and not something that would be thrown away.    -I also usually buy a piece of clothing as well.    Note: I have already booked a hotel so I am mostly trying to budget for spending. ,Kimi Hare,Tokyo Prefecture,
Hi..my flight will arrive at Haneda ard 10.30pm. I plan to change JR pass to ride on earlist shinkansen to hokkaido. I found out that the JR office at Tokyo Station only open at 7.30am so I think i can only catch 2nd earliest shinkansen which is around 8.30am. If i check in to any hotel it will be waste of money is there any place in Tokyo Station that I can put my luggage and have a nap while waiting for 7.30am JR office? tq ,snakenov,,Kuala Lumpur...

I will be going to Sapporo Niseko Lake Toya Asahikawa from 22 Nov to 14 Dec. I will be relying on trains & buses to get around.    As I will be departing New Chitose Airport on 14 Dec I prefer to make Sapporo my last stop. Moreover I want to do the majority of my shopping there and I don't want to lug my heavy luggage all over.    I understand Niseko shuttle bus will run from 2nd December onwards. I am not a skier; I just want to go to Niseko to do non-skiing winter activities.      What is the recommended itinerary?    Tentatively I want to go to Asahikawa on 23 Nov first and stay for about a week. Then check out on 30 Nov & go to Lake Toya. Then check out on 2nd Dec & go to Niseko. Afterwards check out on 4th & go to Sapporo and stay till 14th.    Another question I have is will bus driver reject us from boarding the bus due to our suitcases if we are not travelling during morning peak hours? My budget is limited & I hope to travel on bus if possible. ,Harumi18,Sapporo,"Singapore, Singapore"

In a span of little over one year I’ve climbed Mount Fuji three times and loved every second of it. I experienced all kinds of weather and walked all Mt. Fuji trails.    I put all my knowledge and experience into my new guide in which you will find 100 questions with detailed answers about climbing Mount Fuji.    It covers: level of difficulty climbing season trails mountain huts one-day climbs (summer /off-season) safety measures and preparation. This is likely the most comprehensive guide to climbing Mount Fuji available online.

I've previously climbed Mt Fuji and am planning on revisiting Japan in May/June time.    However as we know this is off season for Fuji.    Is it possible to just partially climb the mountain? The view from the 7th station was phenomenal and I think that would do for us in a day trip. ,SolidShook,,

Planning to purchase JR pass on official website. Already calculated would be worthwhile for my upcoming trip. I recall being asked for date of activation on the official website. We will land in Osaka airport after traveling for 24 hours (due to layover). I originally wanted to start using JR pass right away for the JR Haruka Express to Kyoto. However now reading long lines for JR pass at the airport I'm not keen to wait around. So my plan is to eyeball the situation and decide on the spot about these passes. The question is --- would it matter if I selected an earlier activation date on the official site but decide to activate 2 days later? Please excuse me if this is a stupid question. My head is spinning from all the research/preparations for this upcoming trip. Thanks in advance. ,MochiNut,,NJ

My wife and I will be staying at the Prince Gallery Hotel next week. We will need to do one or two loads of laundry during that part of our stay. I called the hotel but I'm not sure they understood my question as he kept saying there was a fee per item (likely for dry cleaning). So I'm not sure they have this type of laundry service. Would anyone happen to know if the PG offers this?    If not then are there do it yourself coin laundries around that area?    I saw the Wash and Fold site but it looks like you must join or that is geared more for regular weekly-type service. If we could drop it off there in the morning and come back to get it later in the day that would be ideal.    Thanks again. ,dw732,Tokyo,Chicago

Hi all    I'm trying to decide which hotel location is better Hotel 88 Shinsaibashi or Grids Premium Hotel Osaka Namba. We're a family of four who will be in Osaka for 3 days next spring. Both of these hotels have availability and fit our budget.    We'll be coming in from Kyoto via train and plan to take a day trip to Nara before taking the shinkansen to Tokyo. We may have some luggage with us so short walking distance to/from train station is preferred. I tried to do some googling and it looks like Hotel 88 is closer to the trains that we'll take. Is there any reason the area around Grids Hotel would be more desirable than Hotel 88?    Thank you! ,aeio2,Osaka,Honolulu

Does this refer to only the baggage to be put in the hold of the bus? In addition to this would I be able to carry a laptop backpack in the cabin? Thanks in advance. ,fnmistry,Tokyo,

I am planning 4 or 5 days in May around the Seto Inland Sea.  What are the best places/observatories to enjoy the Seto Inland Sea between Okayama and Setonaikai Park?  I would like to go on a boat trip but I only discovered the Guntu cruise/floating Ryokan which is quite expensive. Are there other alternatives?  I already know Hiroshima and Miyajima.

I have been to Japan before but have never utilized long distance trains for travelling. I booked tickets for the Fuji Excursion train. I will be staying in the Asakusa area and according to Google Maps From Asakusa Station I will be transferring to Kanda Station before I will get to Shinjuku Station to board the Fuji Excursion. Can I use the Fuji Excursion ticket in Asakusa Station? or do I use my IC card to tap in and to exit Kanda Station and then use the Fuji Excursion ticket once I get to Shinjuku station? ,Louyn B,Fujikawaguchiko-machi,
We’re staying at a fairly new hotel right near Senso-ji. Today we found a polite note under the door that “syringes” should be brought to the front desk in a separate bag. My wife is diabetic and she put a spent insulin pen in the trash. There was no needle since we dispose of those back home. In going through the trash the maid also found a SUICA card. This card was transferred to an iPhone so it was no longer of any use. The card was on the desk. They must have thought I dropped it in by mistake. Going through the trash seems a bit odd to me. Am I missing something? ,mountainhouse,Tokyo,Northern Calfornia
We are leaving a cruise in Toyko in March 24 and plan to stay 2 nights after the cruise before flying on to Vietnam.

I need to purchase train tickets for Tokyo to Hakuba (12/28) and Hakuba to Kyoto (12/31). I have been told I should purchase the tickets in advance to get seat reservations as the train get VERY crowded over the New Year holiday.  1. I am based in the US do I need to buy it online at the exactly the 30 day mark when tickets are released because they will sell out quickly (vs. buy tickets once I get to Japan a few das before 12/27)?  2. Should I buy the tickets myself via the JR East website (I can choose seats) or through a third party vendor (I can not choose seats) so that I won't make any mistakes?  3. I am anxious that seats will sell out if I decide to go through a 3rd party vendor are there any recommendations for one?  Thank you for any advice! ,SJHNYSC,,"New York, NY"
Hi everyone    We're thinking of planning a family trip to Japan (Osaka or Tokyo) for around 10 days starting 10 June 2024. I've read numerous sites saying that it's rainy hot and humid in June so would like to know if it's really not a good time to visit then. We don't have many options on dates as we're limited by school vacation periods.    We're planning to do some sightseeing shopping and visiting theme parks. Any suggestions / advice on Osaka vs Tokyo would be appreciated too (first time to Japan for all of us - 2 adults with 2 teens). ,alhana14,Osaka,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi all    We are planning on our first overseas trip with our toddler who will be 2y4mo by the time of our trip in early March. We will spend 6 nights in Tokyo and then 6 nights in Kyoto.    I have a few questions and would very much love some feedback and input to those who have been to Tokyo with a young toddler. This is my 3rd time in Japan but very first time with my son and it would also be his very first flight! It will be a long one as we come from Australia.    1)  Which areas would you recommend for us to stay in Tokyo? In the past we have stayed in Shinjuku and Ikebukuro - would these areas be suitable for a young toddler? I read that Akihabara may not be as family friendly at night with the gambling and host scene but I honestly don't recall any of this when we stayed last time! I was told to choose close to Yamanote line to reduce much walking time (as we will be using a stroller too)    2)  Which hotels are good and family-friendly? We stayed in hostels and smaller hotels in the past so we are not familiar! I have looked into Airbnb and apartment hotels like Mimaru and Sakura Cross. But all the different branches and areas got me all confused. Would love to hear any personal recommendations if you have any. Our budget is 20000-30000yen per night.    3)  How are restaurants with stroller and high chairs? I remember in the past some restaurants are super tiny and wont have space for stroller out stroller is a yo-yo and it can be folded up will they let us in? And do most restaurants have high chairs?    4)  Disneyland/Disneysea - I am a MASSIVE Disney fan and have always visited whenever I was in Japan my son however has no clue about these things and my husband isn't a huge fan. Should I still go or just give it a miss this time? 100% believe we will be back again as we love Japan but it's been almost 10 years since i've been.. so kinda dont wanna miss it lol.    5)  Team Lab Planets and Borderless - we want to go to both as I heard both are amazing and good for kids. Do you think we can do both in one day or should we split it into one day each?    6)  Lastly would love ti hear any recommendations for kid-friendly restaurants in and around Tokyo.    To anyone who read my whole post I know it's a lot.. Thank you!! ,Xan Y,Tokyo,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hello hello...    My family will be travelling from Osaka to Tokyo on 1 Jan and staying in Shinjuku.    All my research tells me that shops and many restaurants will be closed on 1 Jan except for combis and fast food restaurants. I've even tried searching for restaurants using Google Map. All the restaurants that offer online booking wouldn't accept my reservation with 1 Jan date.    For those who were in Shinjuku on previous New Years Day:  1) Were there decent restaurants open that you could just do a walk-in?    2) Can we do anything in Shinjuku? I'm imagining streets might be dark and quiet.    Perhaps we should just buy instant noodles from a combi and hibernate in the hotel room. Haha.    Thank you. ,PerthBlueSky,Tokyo,"Perth, Australia"

On the arrival form you have to list how long you plan to stay in the country. If you want to travel around for some weeks to a month(s) is it a problem if you stay longer than the # of days you initially put on the form as long as it's less than 90 days?

The ‘off the beaten track’ parts to our itinerary are:  A day trip to Nikko in mid December  A day trip to Kinosaki Onsen in late December  Numerous days in Hokkaido (Sapporo Otaru snow resort Hakodate) in early January.  We are definitely each travelling with a pair of sneakers/trainers plus a pair of apres/snow boots. Hubby has a good pair of snow boots the kids and mine are more the apres style.

We have just returned from an incredible 13 days in Japan and thought we’d share some thoughts in the hope it may help others with planning.we bought an esim in advance which was a godsend!    We arrived in Haneda very late so stayed at JAL West Wing- v close to the airport and shuttle bus included. Ryokan was good functional but lots of amenities provided and close to a convenience store.we made use of their onsen the first night we were there which was lovely.    The following day we got the train to Ueno- this was a bit challenging- we got a bit lost but made it in the end!    We loved the Ueno area a lot quieter than other areas of Tokyo we explored and lots of nice restaurants and independent businesses. Ueno park and the museums are fab!    We had booked our JR pass via the official site and made all our reservations in advance. Picked passes and tickets up from Ueno station which was much less crowded than any other station we saw. Also bought passimo passes here which were great and able be used for subways in all the cities we visited- suicas weren’t available when we were there- would def recommend one or the other so easy to top up.    Highlights of Tokyo were Ueno TeamLab Planets which we loved( toed this in with lunch at the Fish Market) Sensoji was stunning and we loved just wandering and finding places to explore ( and shop!). We had some great sushi in a place where you ordered food on a tablet and it was delivered by Shinkansen! And the biggest food highlight was dinner at Ise Sueyoshi- outstanding!    Got the Shinkansen to Kyoto ( bought amazing bento boxes to take with us at the station). Kyoto was a bit of a shock after Tokyo - so much busier! Lunch at Nishiki market was fun. We loved Fushimi Imari we went late afternoon and saw sunset which was stunning. Easy train back into Kyoto. The following day we got an Uber to kinkakuji (the golden temple) and another to Kiyomizu Dera where we then walked back to the centre. They were both lovely but absolutely heaving to the extent that at the golden pavilion you were walking as a throng of people. Still lovely but not exactly calm!!  The next day we took the train to Nara which was one of our highlights absolutely loved it and all the temples and shrines. Had lunch at the view but if a line but well worth it we had one of their beautiful sushi/ tempura lunches which was amazing- def recommend! That evening we explored Gion which was lovely.  On our final morning in Kyoto we went to the bamboo forest. We got there early and missed most of the crowds. Again it was gorgeous. We got last min tickets on the Sagano railway which was nice- we had originally planned to tie this in with the boat trip but decided against it due lack of time. The railway was nice but if I had to skip one thing it would probably be that.    We took the train to Osaka and headed out to see the running man lit up. Had dinner at an amazing Okonomiyaki restaurant. Tiny place and we waited an hour but absolutely worth it- food was amazing people were lovely and we loved it!    Up early the next day to go to USJ. I was worried we wouldn’t get into Super Nintendo World ( we didn’t pay for express tickets) but we managed to find the billboard with QR code for timed entries. We started with the minions mayhem ride and only waited 10 mins ( up to 90 mins later in the day). We then Headed off to Nintendo World where we rode as single riders ) much less queuing and well worth it!). We had lunch and watched the parade then went to Harry Potter World where again we jumped the huge queues by riding as single riders. We had a great day my top tips are to get there before it opens get your Nintendo timed entry and get to some of the bigger rides before it gets really busy.    The following day we got an early train to Hiroshima. We used our JR pass for the train and ferry to Miyajima which we loved! We wished we had had longer to explore the weather was amazing and it was different pace to everywhere else. We spent a couple of hours there before going back into Hiroshima where we went to the museum and peace pavilion. The museum was good sobering but exceptionally busy. I def think they need to do something about reducing numbers/ timed entry as within the rooms where they had the collections you literally couldn’t move let alone get to see everything. The later rooms were less crowded and we were still glad we went.    We checked out of our hotel the following morning to travel back to Tokyo via Himeji. So glad we did this it was amazing! The castle and grounds were stunning ( we did the tea ceremony at the team pavilion too)  And we had great Kobe beef with rice.    Got back to Tokyo early evening and stayed in the Hamamatsucho area- we primarily chose this due to the location of the monorail to get back to the airport but we didn’t like it nearly as much as Ueno. It was much busier lots of bars but not many restaurants. The hotel was ok. Spent our last 2 days in Tokyo shopping exploring Ginza and Shinjuku and visiting Meiji Jingu.    Overall an amazing 2 weeks with an awful lot packed in! We loved Japan the food was incredible it was super clean but it was the people who really made it. Everybody was so kind- whenever we looked a bit lost someone helped us. The trains and subway were brilliant and easy to navigate once you get the hang of them. We walked a LOT- average step count was 21000 steps per day over the 2 week period. If we were doing it again we’d maybe try to  Plan in a bit of downtime as we were knackered!! A brilliant brilliant trip so much so that we’re thinking of going back next October and seeing some more of the countryside. ,bruisyard,,United Kingdom

We are a family of 4 including teenaged kids did a 10 days Japan trip covering mostly Tokyo and Kyoto during end October- sharing some of our experience if it may help any fellow travelers in their planning  • We did our travel planning and booking on our own- travelling from Bangalore to Tokyo Haneda Airport through Singapore (Singapore Airlines)  • We booked our tickets almost 5 months in advance that helped to get a good rate for the flights  • Rooms were also booked 3-4 months before for better rates- since we were travelling with older kids we had to book 2 rooms  • We opted for Hotels close to Train station which helped a lot in our local travels  • Rough Itinerary was 3 Days in Tokyo ( 1 day Mt Fuji day trip 2 days in Tokyo including Team Labs Planet) 4 Days in Kyoto ( 1 day USJ 1 Day Nara and 2 days in Kyoto) rest of the days were travel days -this is a bit rushed itinerary I agree  • We took a 7 day JR pass which was very useful not only for the shinkansen but for some of our day trips like Nara and USJ    Some tips from our experience    • Exchanging JR Pass voucher at Haneda airport is very time consuming it took me more than an hour and they will not reserve your seats- so if not in a hurry it may be better to do the same after your arrival in one of the other JR stations  • WE have taken a limousine bus pass for transfer from airport to hotel- but on arrival it was informed they don’t cover the area we need to travel- so please be careful on this option- trains are much more reliable though it can be bit crowded and on arrival can seem like a bit of hassle  • There is no option to exchange the subway pass vouchers which we bought through Klook at the airport and many smaller stations as well- so we ended up using the pass only from Day 2- it may be better to buy the same from one of the stations if you intend to use the same. Mostly we did a lot of walking and use of subway was not that extensive so I may even think an IC card should do the job. Also if you have the JR pass many trips can be covered using the same.  • We got a welcome Suica for all four of us which was convenient for travel and shopping  • If you have large luggage please plan to reserve your seats in advance to get the designated seats especially during peak season  • October end wasn’t a peak season still there was crowd- so prepare for the same  • Food options are limited for vegetarians- so would be better to plan in advance if you are very particular  • Not many people speak English but google translate can be very helpful and every one we met were extremely helpful and accommodating  • You may need to plan extra time to navigate the stations exits etc since it may take time  • USJ was very crowded even on a Friday but single rider lines can save a lot of time if you are fine not to be in your groups- we used that for most rides and ended up in the same group most times – at least 2 of us were in same group – we felt it was better than not able to ride  • We used a pocket wifi for 10 days from Ninjawifi- never faced any connectivity issues though for full day use we needed power back up since the device used to completely drain by evening. ,suman n,,"Bengaluru, India"
Hey only slightly researched this before I left and not bought an IC or pasmo yet. We fly into Haneda this morning but our 5 day pass won't start until rhe day after. Looked at a 1 day metro pass but then saw the trillions of other options. Not sure if our journey to the hotel uses the toei line as I can't put my pass into navitime to check. just having a day exploring today as we go to Nagano tommorrow.

Assuming the weather is relatively clear what time of day would you go up to visit the Mount Moiwa Observation Deck?    I will be in Sapporo in mid-October -- evenings of 13 and 14 October.

We will be arrived at Kansai Airport at 3pm on 3rd of December. We are family of 5.    I am thinking to take either Nankai Rapid or JR Haruka Kansai Airport to our hotel at Rihga Place Higobashi.    Which is better? We will depart from Osaka to Kansai Airport early in the morning on 12th Dec. Are Nankai Rapid or JR Haruka the 2 best options to use too?    We will stay in Osaka for 4 nights (I have bought 2 days Osaka Amazing Passes) and will be using Osaka Amazing Passes for 2 consecutive days- was thinking to use on the last 2 days. Can I use the pass to take train from Osaka to Kyoto?    For the days which we don’t use Osaka Amazing Passes what mode of transport (any passes/ transport card should we use?)    I understand that Osaka Amazing Passes has included most of the transports within Osaka- but does it included the train from Osaka to Kyoto and vice versa? Or from Osaka to Kansai Airport?    Then we will be staying 4 nights in Kyoto at Oriental Hotel. I am thinking to use hankyu tourist passes in Kyoto. From what I understand the transport in the city and transport to Kobe is included.    And we will come back to Osaka from Kyoto for another 2 nights stay at Kitahama.    We are thinking to go branded outlet near Osaka-mainly want to look for Northface. Any good recommendations?    We will be going to Universal Studio on the 11th December. Any transport passes we need for this 2 days in Osaka for going to outlet and also to Universal Studio.    I am sorry for being so lengthy.    Thanks in advance for your advises. ,HY C,Osaka,Malaysia

HI. We purchased JR green passes prior to the increase on 1st October. We arrive on the 10th Nov at 8pm so the JR office in terminal 3 will be shut. I believe that JR office in terminal 2 is open until 11pm. I'm a bit worried about getting the trains we want after reading how quickly the shinkansen train tickets are selling. Should we go to terminal 2 on the night we get there or wait until the following day. ,David,,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hi! I will be visiting Japan for around 24 days from March 15th and I'm having some trouble finalizing my itinerary. I will travel with my mother (70 y.o) she's quite active but I'd rather go at a slow pace and not change base too often.    My idea so far is the following:  -Tokyo (+day trips): 7 days  -Kyoto: 4.5 days  -Osaka (+Nara/Himeji): 3.5 days  -Kanazawa: 2.5 days  -Takayama (+Shirakawago): 2.5 days    I still have 2 more days to allocate. What would you suggest? Where could I extend my stay? Should I add some other place?    Thank you very much! ,LJT88,,Buenos Aires...

Hello There - I will be in Tokyo until the 24th of November. My flight leaves at 6 PM for the US. I am thinking of making a visit to Nagano the 23rd for the fireworks. However I have read reports that getting back to the train station is very difficult given the number of people that attend the amazin g event. And in some cases people miss the train. Normally that wouldn't be a big deal for me but I want to make certain I get back to Tokyo quickly since I leave the next day to come home. Can anyone advise me on just how difficult and crowded it is to get back to Nagano Station after the fireworks end? I was going to walk back with my family of four and take the 9.46 train (reserved seating). Thank you in advance. ,1900businesstraveler,Nagano,
Is the JR pass worth it for a 7 day trip?    Hi!    I’ll be activating the JR pass from 1st to 7th April. I’ll be travelling to Osaka Kyoto Nara and then Tokyo within this time. I plan to go to Hakone as well during this time (I’m well aware that it’s a jam-packed schedule :/) I was wondering if the JR pass is worth it given the current price hike. I’ll be travelling with two other people as well so I hope to save as much money as possible.    Can anyone please give me some advice about this? Thanks. ,haze,,"Pune, India"
This will be my first trip to Japan via Narita and my idea is to stay in Tokyo explore it at leisurely pace (not a youngster or night owl anymore) and do few day trips (Mt. Fuji Hakone Kamakura/Enoshima perhaps Nikko).  Plan to visit standard landmarks modern art/tech quirkier the better and just to sample a local life.  I am thinking of a hotel(s) in a 10k yen range (small room is ok) with a convenient/quick access to transit and perhaps choose 2 different stay locations if that makes visiting diverging places more expedient.    Would appreciate suggestion for a particular area and hotel! ,a_dotdot_dam,Tokyo,Canada

Hello we arrive in Japan on 21 December and as we are getting closer just wondering what we should be reserving now and how far in advance can it be done e.g. Universal Studios museums other tix???

Hi I’ve booked a private airport transfer in a 7 seater. Four people four suitcases and four carry ons.  I’ve just noticed in the fine print it says that there is an allowance for four pieces of luggage. Is carry on usually considered part of that allowance? It’s a seven seater van so there will be three empty seats… surely the carry on can go on those seats/floor?    They’re saying that it might not fit but I’m not sure if they’re just trying to upsell me? ,SuperTJ,Tokyo,"Brisbane, Australia"
Just a question about how train reservation machines at the stations work. For example if I am travelling from Shin-Osaka to Nagasaki from memory there are 3 legs to this journey and because I’m travelling on a peak travel day around new year I’m looking to make a reservation for all legs of the journey.  I believe the reservation machines didn’t exist when I was in Japan previously (2019) so I’m not familiar with them.  Will I need to add each leg as a separate journey or can I do the whole journey at once and then choose reservations for each leg?  I have quite a few journeys like this and will need to make quite a few reservations because we’re travelling a lot around the new year days. I guess it would be much easier if I can do an entire journey eg Shin-Osaka to Nagasaki in one go rather than break it down into separate components.  Many thanks to everyone for their help it’s always very appreciated. ,Renee1901,,
We’ve previously visited Takayama and will spend another 2 nights there on our upcoming trip towards December.  We have an afternoon and one full day. We’re planning on seeing the Hida Folk Village as somehow we missed it on the last trip plus a few hours wandering the old town of Takayama. Apart from that we did the other sights of Takayama on the last holiday and were thinking of taking a trip to Furukawa for half a day/perhaps afternoon and evening.  Is Furukawa worth a visit (in late Dec)? ,Renee1901,,
We will be taking a Nozomi train from Shinagawa to Kyoto right after our long flight from Seattle to Narita and the Narita Express into Tokyo. I know we will be tired but it is faster and more pleasant than waiting for a flight from NRT to Osaka and then the journey to Kyoto from there.    But I do want to be prepared and not make mistakes that might cause delYs or worse.. So my questions are:    1). I have read that the Shinkansen tickets come in two parts one for the base fare and one for the supplement. And that there are 2 sets of gates that we pass through to access the platform. Do we put both tickets stacked into the entry gates both times?    2). We will have reserved seats likely in Green Class. I see that the Nozomi departs as frequently as every 9-10 minutes on this route presumably from the same platform. Is there a display on the platform that indicates the train number of the arriving train or do we rely on the scheduled time?    I apologize if this question sounds silly but we had a bad experience with a fast Italo train in Italy—right platform correct time right type of train but we ended up on a train to elsewhere as all trains were running late. The train number was not displayed on the platform signboard that we could see. It was so crowded and chaotic we did not have time to think or consider looking for the train number but the time was right so we boarded. It was an expensive and time-consuming mistake.    I know the Japanese trains are different and absolutely on time. So do we just rely on that or is the train number displayed on the platform? Thank you for your help. ,Enzian,,Seattle

We are going to Mt. Fuji on January 2-3 2024. Is it still a holiday for locals then? I'm choosing between taking the bus from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko station or via train. I've heard that Buses are better since not a lot of stopovers unlike taking the train. However I'm worried that it might become traffic along the road if there are still many locals driving to Fuji for their holiday trips. Hope somebody here can shed some light on my dilemma.

I am going on a tour where I will be seeing rural and traditional Japan--Kiso Valley Yoshino & Nara. The tour ends with 2 nights in Kyoto. I'm not sure when we'll arrive in Kyoto (we'll be taking the train from Koyasan). I'd guess mud-afternoon maybe; all the itinerary says is an evening visit to Gion district. The next day's itinerary includes such things as Sanjo-ohashi bridge Nanzenji temple. the Philosopher's Path and the Silver Pavilion. Then there is free time for the rest of the day.    The tour ends the morning of Nov. 23 which I just read is a holiday.    I had contemplated staying a couple extra days in Kyoto to do some more sightseeing but now I am worried about the crowds I will encounter over a holiday (long weekend??). I like gardens historic sights unique architecture interesting walks etc. I am not a shopper or someone who needs trendy eating or nightlife.    What are your thought? Should I extend for several days (if so how many)? Does the fact that this is a holiday change things a lot? I am not someone who enjoys being trapped in hordes of people. I will be traveling back to the US when I leave and I need to add that in to the equation. I think probably the best way to do this is to get to the Osaka airport and then take a flight how from there (connecting through Tokyo). Correct me if there is a better option.    Thanks so much for the assistance. This will be my first trip to Japan and I have no idea if I'll return. I'm also wondering if I do stay if for the convenience factor I should just stay at the tour's hotel (Nohga Kiyomizu Kyoto) which I know nothing about or if I should select different lodging. ,peter s,Kyoto,
Hi  We are 4 Australian adults wanting to rent a car from Narita to Fujiyoshida 27 Jan to 28 Jan 2024.  Of course we will have luggage as well. We have found on Orix Car rental site a big SUV one way for about $500 AUD one way. Any ideas on something cheaper? Will that include all insurance and GPS?  We want to explore the Fujiyoshida and My Fuji area so that is why we want to rent a car rather than public transport into Tokyo and out to Fujiyoshida.

Hello All    We are planning a trip last week of November ( 4 days Tokyo 6 days Kyoto/Osaka) and would like to add a one day trip to Hakone.  Our plan is to include it on our way to Osaka from Tokyo.  We already purchased the JR pass.    Tokyo -> JR pass Odawara -> Hakone -> Odawara -> Shin Osaka  Is this achievable in a day and still see main attractions in Hakone ( Ropeway Train Pirate ship Lake Ashi Mt Fuji view Museum etc). We are not keen on onsen experience.    What time should we start from Tokyo and what time to leave from Hakon in order to reach Shin Osaka by night.  Can we store the luggage at Odawara station and pick them in the evening when going to Osaka?    I do understand an overnight stay is better but I cannot accommodate that now.    Thanks for the suggestions. ,TinkerbellSchool,,

I am fairly restricted in what I can eat for breakfast (but not other meals fortunately) . As a result I usually carry a few packets of instant oatmeal when we travel just in case there is nothing suitable on the breakfast buffet.    Last time we traveled to Japan however (2019) I read that declaring food items can significantly slow one’s passage through passport control and customs at the airport so I did not bring any oatmeal. We were finally able to find some instant oats in Kyoto in a little store that sold mostly sake and other liquors but had a small “foreign food”section. But I have no idea if we can find that store again or if they even exist.    Looking around at customs rules and regulations I found this from the website of the Japanese Consulate-General in Seattle (USA):    “It is usually not necessary to declare store-bought canned bottled or packaged food items that are highly processed and do not contain any meat. Some examples may include crackers dried pasta candy jam tea or coffee. Oh the other hand some products may be prohibited for import depending on the origin of contents.”    I do not want to completely rely on this and count on breezing through customs without declaring 3 packets of oatmeal. Is there anywhere I can see a copy of the customs declaration form? Does it ask if we are bringing in “any food” or does it specify the actual items that are not allowed without inspection like “plants fruit vegetables meat or meat products” and so on?    Or am I unnecessarily concerned about how long customs will take? All I know is what I have read here. I do plan to have our Visit Japan Web forms filled out in advance so we have the QR code.

I'm from the US and this will be my first trip to Japan so I don't already have a stash of yen to bring along. I know that I will immediately need cash (even to get transportation to my hotel). Can I be certain that the ATMs at Haneda (are easy to find) and will be stocked with cash? I read here to use the 7 type machines or ones associated with the post office. I ask because we once had a string of mishaps when flying into Paris and couldn't get any cash at the airport; we were just lucky that a bus into town took credit cards so we could at least get into town where we could get euros. (I will bring about $100 in cash so if worst comes to worst I can go to an airport currency exchange desk and get ripped off.) Thanks. ,peter s,Tokyo,

Hello everyone. I plan to travel from Shinjuku Station to Hakone-Yumoto Station on Friday 24 Nov. I will spend 2 nights in Hakone area (already booked a place near the Hakone-Yumoto station) and then return to Shinjuku on Sunday 26 Nov.    1) It seems there is some discount for the digital pass from the Kanagawa Prefecture’s rail travel promotion. I would like to purchase the Digital Hakone Pass (2 days) from the EMOT site for departure from Shinjuku on Friday. Should I choose the Weekdays 2 days Hakone Area + Odakyu Line Round Trip Ticket at JPY 4270? or the Saturdays Sundays and public holidays 2 days - Hakone Area + Odakyu Line Round Trip Ticket at JPY 4880?    I tried to purchase the higher price [Saturdays Sundays and public holidays] Hakone Pass but the date in the EMOT site calendar is greyed-out and the EMOT site does not allow me to proceed. My concern is that I won't be able to use the pass in Hakone if I purchase the Weekdays pass since I will spend Saturday and Sunday in the Hakone area.    2) Is it feasible to visit the Fuji Five Lakes (mainly to Lake Kawaguchiko) for several hours from Hakone-Yumoto and then return to Hakone-Yumoto on the same day?    Thank you in advance. ,Kotz,Kanto,"Dubai, United Arab..."

Hello all    I am travelling to Japan 28 April to 12 May in 2024 which means the start of my trip is Golden Week.    We plan on going to Takayama on 2 May (Tokyo>Nagoya>Takayama) and then Takayama to Kyoto (Takayama>Nagoya>Kyoto) on 4 May ending in Tokyo on 9 May.    With the big increase in cost of JR Rail Pass and fact it doesn't cover Nozomi which we need (I think) we're not going to get the pass but definitely want reserved seats in advance so:    - How early should we / can you book and how? It seems some sites let you book now but just vague times and they give you train nearest time asked for which feels risky for connections.  – If you buy a reserved ticket do you have to then select your seat at the station or do the tickets come with automatically allocated seats?  – What is the best way for collecting tickets in Tokyo: has anyone tried delivery to hotel service or international delivery? We are staying by Shinjuku station.  – For the JR pass west for Hida line train can that be collected in Tokyo or would you have to collect when changing at Nagoya?    Thank very much in advance!

Hi I'm planning a trip in 2024!  As the regular JR pass won't be worth buying at the new price I'm planning to go to Kyoto via Kanazawa using the Hokuriku Arch pass so I can see Kenrokuen and Shirakawago.  I had a few questions and was hoping for some help please:    We arrive at Narita T1 in the evening and will travel to Nikko early the next morning. Where might be the best area to stay in and the best way to get there? The Skyliner goes to Ueno which means a subway trip to Tobu Asakusa that night or the next morning. Otherwise can the Keisei Skyaccess be used to easily intersect the Tobu Nikko line somewhere with OK accommodation? (Business hotel is ok) .  Do the fastest trains stop at any intersection points?    When leaving Nikko for Kanazawa does the Tobu Nikko line intersect the Hokuriku Shinkansen line. Best I can tell it does not.    Thanks ,NZGemini,Kyoto,"Auckland, New..."
Would a 5-day Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass (~17000 yen) be worth it in my case?    I will be in the Kyoto area for 6 days. We are staying near Kyoto Station and the trips we have planned from there are:    - Kiyomizudera Temple  - Nara  - Okunoshima Rabbit Island  - Arashiyama  - Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine  - Golden Pavilion  - Nishiki Market  - Kansai airport via Haruka    If we get the 5-day pass we would have to pay for the other (6th) day with an IC card.    From my rough calculations I think it's worth it to get the pass because of the (very long) rabbit island trip but I wanted to get some second opinions. Thanks! ,Daydream24977526412,,Santa Clara...
(By the way I am an older female not a male. My account is all screwed up.)    In the second half of November I am doing a 2 week tour that is billed as a hiking tour that visits old pilgrimage trails. In addition to the usual cities and all the walking that visiting them entails we will be doing some hiking in the countryside on half of the days of the tour. I am trying to decide about footwear. I don't want overkill since I am going to have to wear these boots/shoes even on days when we are just sightseeing and visiting temples in cities. Will I want a true hiking boot or will a lower moderate type trail walking shoe or sneaker be fine? And would waterproof be advisable? (I will be bringing trekking poles).    Here's where we'll be hiking:    Base of Mt. Fuji or one of the lower mountains in the area  Nakasendo highway Tsumago & Magome  16 km walk at foot of Mt. Miwa in the Nara basin  Trails around Asuka region  Yoshino to Kurotaki--12k on Kumano Kodo  Dorogawa area riverside trails and mountain passes  Mitarai Gorge    Thanks in advance. ,peter s,,

Hi guys! I am planning a trip to Sapporo from 9-12 May 2023. I saw that the full bloom in forecasted for 2nd May. What will be the chances that I will get to spot it on 9th May?

Hi    Plan to go to Tokyo during mid - late April next year and read that Shibazakura festival is one of the highlight. Will be staying in Kyobashi area so shohld be walking distance to the bus terminal at Tokyo station.  My questions:  1. Is it worth it to go to Shibazakura during mid April (and not May)? Has the pink flowers typically bloom yet?    2. Plan to go using a roundtrip bus to Kawaguchi-ko station and then purchase a shibazakura liner from there. I saw this link on klook https://s.klook.com/c/mXbVVbgzyB  Does 'Lake Kawaguchi station west' means the same as kawaguchiko station? And I can purchase the shibazakura liner tickets there?    3. Other than using the link on klook how should I buy a regular highway bus ticket to kawaguchiko from tokyo station online? I checked the website and it seems to only from shinjuku/ shibuya (at least what I found in english).    Sorry for the long question.  Thanks! ,Epin,Tokyo,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Hi!  I snoozed a bit and the sunset tickets are sold out during the dates we are traveling to Tokyo for the Shibuya Sky.

So needing suggestions on our itinerary. We are 2 middle aged women going for the first time in second week of May and using public transportation. We are into beaches hiking mountains and festivals and not looking for shopping or cities (although we do want to see Tokyo). We are hoping to see the azaleas. For one we are not sure what order we should do it (north to south or whatever). Also wondering if there is too much moving around. It seems like there are so many fabulous places to go it is hard to choose so any suggestions for alternative stops would be appreciated. We are coming from Seattle flying into Narita. ,summertravelor,,"Seattle, Washington"

Are there any cities or regions in Japan with unlimited monthly/weekly passes for local/regional public transport? Just curious. Or do all people just pay one-off journeys with Suica cards?

Hi All  I'm going to be coming from Tokyo on an early train in early November for 3 days. I'm seeing so many people going to Nara from Kyoto so I'm wondering if I should give one of my days to a trip there? It will be my first trip to Japan so I'm going to be fitting as much in as I can! I still hope to do the main tourist attractions in Kyoto but I'd like to hear from people who've been to both and if they'd recommend spending a day in Nara.    Thanks ,bungaro,,"Cork, Ireland"

We currently have Mint Mobile which works fine in US. However has anyone used Mint in Japan? I know you can load $ into the account for international usage but I have no idea what the rates are for text messages from US to Japan.    I was looking into getting an Ubigi sim card but then realized all these sims are data only. So if I have 2 step authentication to log into say my bank or gmail how will I get those messages? I do also have my iphone text messages linked to my icloud.com accounts as well as phone number but I'm just not sure if that works the same as I've seen only suggestions to add Messenger WhatsApp and Skype vs mentioning apple messages.    Would anyone be able to confirm if 2 step authorization (set up for a phone number) still works when they added an esim? Sorry I'm sure I'm making it more complicated than it is but seeing how often I have to authenticate in the US side is making me nervous for our trip in less than 3 weeks. ,Chartreuse,,
My parents were going to be in Osaka for 6 weeks they like to go there and do some touristy things but mostly stay in a local neighborhood and explore it thoroughly. I decided to join them for 10 days and went solo to Tokyo before meeting up with them.    Things I did beforehand which really helped me out:  - Installed Suica on my phone and got it loaded up with ¥2000.  - Installed a Ubigi esim. This challenged me technologically but I took it slow and methodically and was successful. (It worked seamlessly. I can give more detailed instructions if anyone wants).  - Researched the subway enough that I could get from the airport to my hotel even if my esim failed me.    Tues 10/10  Flew from SAC-LAX-HND  Took the monorail to the Hamamatsuchō station then transferred to the Yamanote line to the Ueno station. Ueno Touganeya Hotel had provided pictures to get from the station to the hotel. Nothing looked like the pictures so I had a moment of panic but I calmed down and eventually figured out one of the directions and got to the hotel. Very basic hotel small room but very clean and perfect for my needs especially at about $60/night.    It was about 6pm and I knew I didn't want to go to sleep so I decided to take a long walk. Unfortunately I went in an opposite direction of where there were people/nightlife so I had a very lonely dark wet rainy street walk and had a I've made a terrible mistake stomach ache.    Wed 10/11  The next morning I was up early for an Airbnb Experience Walking Tour. Was so happy that I'd booked this for my first full day as it gave me the opportunity to not use my brain to just follow someone else's lead especially navigating the subway. She also helped me with my Suica as it was all in Japanese and I wasn't sure how to add money.    These are the spots we hit:  Meiji Shrine  Shibuya Scramble  Takeshita Street  Tsukiji Honganji Temple  Tsukiji Fish Market  The Imperial Palace  Marunouchi Business District  Tokyo Station  Akihabara  Ueno Park  Asakusa  Sensoji Temple    Our lovely tour guide Yasuko finished the tour with a beer at an Izakaya. Another couple from the tour and I got ramen at Ichiran Ramen and I wandered around a bit more clocking in at 25k steps before turning in.    Thurs 10/12  My hotel was right near Ueno Park so I wandered over there early stumbled across a Dahlia garden which was at the tail end of blooming but still pretty.    I had a 12pm reservation at Washoku Asakusa. I had seen this restaurant on Instagram and they have beautiful pictures you have to make reservations in advance as well as indicate what you want to eat and I thought I was ordering a pretty plate of sushi but instead I had ordered an amazing set lunch that was a selection of 12 tasty bites. They have a station set up with different flavor miso balls rice nori squares to make your own hand rolls. It was just so unexpectedly amazing and such a fun experience. I sat overlooking the river had a beer and this may have been my favorite meal of the whole trip.    Afterwards I went to Tokyo Dome an amusement park of sorts with a roller coaster ferris wheel various other rides and a bunch of shops. Spa Laqua was my reason for visiting there and it was quite an experience! It was a pretty fancy bath house with a bunch of indoor/outdoor pools as well as a huge floor called the Healing Baden which had sauna salt clay cold napping rooms. Other rooms too which I didn't even go into because they were at the end of hallways with just a wooden sign in Japanese and I wasn't quite confident enough to open the door. Confidence is needed in general if you've been to a Japanese bath house...well you know what I mean.    After a super relaxing time at the spa I went on the ferris wheel and I decided of all the lonely things to do a ferris wheel ride tops the list.  I had a chicken curry dinner at a little place around the corner from my hotel hit 17k steps and turned in.    Friday 10/13  I had read about an amazing 18 piece set breakfast at Tsukiji Honganji Cafe Tsumugi and since I had a 10:30 reservation at Teamlab and would be in the area thought I better check it out.    It opens at 8am and I heard that they only serve 100 of the set breakfasts. There was a line of about 30 people when I got there at 7:45 at 8 a guy came out and said something in Japanese and about half the people in line got out of line and scooted over to another side. I gathered that these were people with reservations. They all got seated and then they started seating the rest of us. By the time it got to me I was given a ticket and told to come back at 9am.    I went around the corner to Turret Coffee and had an amazing salted caramel latte and sat outside and read until 9am. The breakfast was so fun and fun of interesting new things to taste. It askari comes with hot green tea and rice porridge. Everything is labeled which I loved.    Then I was off to take the bus to Teamlab. What do I say about this? Cons: It has an amusement park feel as you line up to get inside it's crowded you have to take off your shoes which I just tried to not think about too much and one of the exhibits gave me motion sickness and I felt sick for a few hours also hard to take pics solo.  Pros: most of the exhibits are pretty and fun.  It wasn't expensive it's kind of out of the way but if you're going to combine it with Tsukiji market then why not.    Tsukiji outer market afterwards was not enjoyable at all as I felt sick. I got an ice cream cone found a place to sit and waited out the worst of the nausea.    Then I was off to the Art Aquarium Museum in Ginza. I personally thought this was way overpriced for what it was and a waste of time. But it was in a fancy department store that was fun to walk through and the basement food court area was AMAZING! I got some lunch went outside to the relaxation terrace area and sat ate and read for awhile.    I had a reservation at Shibuya Sky at 4:30 as I wanted to be there for sunset. I didn't enjoy Shibuya Sky at all. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it but I didn't feel like any of the seating areas were comfortable. The sunset was beautiful though I can't deny that and I saw Mt. Fuji in the distance so that's a win also it was nice to have a place to sit and have a breather if you need it; I likely will chalk this up to just being another thing that's just too lonely to do solo.    This was my last night in Tokyo so I wanted to go see the neon lights so I went to Shinjuku and wandered around Nonbei Yokocho Neon Alley and watched the cat billboard for way too long. I stumbled across a casual restaurant with a vending machine or front that gives you tickets when you order had a big beer (didn't know I was ordering the BIG size) and a plate of gyoza. Japan is so great for eating solo it never felt weird. 21k steps and I was ready for bed.    I left the next morning for Osaka so this ends my Tokyo portion of the trip! ,OneoftheJs,,California

Hi. We are a family of four with two young adult children 18 and 20 years old. I have been searching all past posts for new years and don’t know what to do. I don’t think the fireworks at universal is what we are looking for. Wanted to have it be lively and fun so was looking for something to do in the evening like dinner and drinks and a place where we could do the count down and ring in the year. I was looking for some young energy for the 18 and 20 year old if possible. Any suggestions ?    I came to Osaka for new years because thought it would be better for the adult kids according to reviews but it would be just as convenient and maybe more so to be in Kyoto if there was an experience just as good we could do there New Year’s Eve.

My wife and I have a special anniversary coming up next year and a visit to Japan would be a great way to celebrate it.  We'd probably be there for 12 days ( we're flexible on arrival date & budget could stretch to 14) & would like to see/visit Tokyo Mt Fuji Kyoto Osaka & Hiroshima. Any other suggestions welcome. It would be around the time of Cherry Blossoms so was wondering what the best date would be to see them. Kyoto seems to be the best place from what I read.  We'd be arriving from Seoul so could enter Japan at either Tokyo or Osaka. and would travel around by train. ( I don't mind driving if needed but the train system looks so good so why bother).  At the end of the trip we;d fly home from Tokyo NRT so I suppose it makes sense to finish off in the capital city.  Many thanks. ,Bazz1812,,"Llanelli, Wales"
Hi everyone    I’m planning a trip with my family to Japan this year and have decided to go with a private tour package.    Interestingly I came across a service called Banyantrip on FB.

We are a couple in our mid 60’s and have travelled many parts of Europe and Asia  now its time to head to Japan. We are looking at going late 2024 for the autumn/fall colours. My question is do we do a 12days guided tour with a tour company or do we do a self guided itinerary ( i actually love planning holidays) either by train or self drive. We’ve never done a guided tour before so not sure what to expect ,dolloppy,,"Melbourne, Australia"

Dear All  Need your valuable suggestions.  We two of us will be visiting Japan in April 24.  We will be reaching Osaka directly and departing from Tokyo  We have a plan of doing day tour of mt fuzi from Shinjukutokyo but is it possiblethat while coming to Tokyo from Osaka we will get down at shin fuji station and do excursion of 5 th stnkawaguchi lake or other interesting places and then depart to Tokyo may be by train or bus as you will suggest. If possible what will be the best way to do all this . We may stay there if required for that night.  ThanksPran ,pran_panipat,,"Panipat, India"
Hi I saw on most websites including the official sites for Sapporo Station JR Hokkaido that the cost of a one-way Rapid Airport train fare to Sapporo is JPY1150 (unreserved).    However I also saw on the Shinkansen website (see https://shinkansen-ticket.com/collections/airportexpress-newchitose/products/airportrapidtrainticket-newchitoseairport-sapporo) that it costs JPY1720 (unreserved). Is this more expensive because it is online booking? Or fare has gone up and not updated in the other websites?    Also does anyone know how much it would cost to take a standard taxi from New Chitose Airport to downtown Sapporo? We will be staying at Karaksa Hotel Sapporo (near Odori station).    Many thanks! ,Yikkie,Sapporo,Bandar Seri...

Hi everyone!  I will be doing a solo travel trip to Hokkaido next winter for 9 days in February (2/1 – 2/10) and I would really appreciate everyone’s help in my itinerary. I’m planning to base myself in Sapporo and then make many day trips to see around Hokkaido. I will not have a car planning to do everything by train. If you have any suggestions to changes or things I’m missing I would greatly welcome it!    2/1-2/3: explore Sapporo and the Sapporo Festival  2/4: day trip to Otaru (is Shakotan worth the extra mile? I know it’s further out/not as accessible)  2/5: day trip to Asahiyama Zoo for the penguin walk  2/5: day trip to Biel/Furano (can you see the blue pond or the Furano flowers in Feb / is it worth the trip?)  2/6-2/7: overnight trip to Noboribetsu spend a night there next day go to Lake Toya  - Would appreciate some help planning logistics here. Is it doable to see Lake Shikotsu too? How would transportation work in between the 2 lakes?  2/7-2/10: more time in Sapporo / open to other ideas    Thanks in advance everyone! ,John,Hokkaido,
We will be arrived at Kansai Airport at 3pm on 3rd of December. We are family of 5.    I am thinking to take either Nankai Rapid or JR Haruka Kansai Airport to our hotel at Rihga Place Higobashi.    Which is better? We will depart from Osaka to Kansai Airport early in the morning on 12th Dec. Are Nankai Rapid or JR Haruka the 2 best options to use too?    We will stay in Osaka for 4 nights (I have bought 2 days Osaka Amazing Passes) and will be using Osaka Amazing Passes for 2 consecutive days- was thinking to use on the last 2 days. Can I use the pass to take train from Osaka to Kyoto?    For the days which we don’t use Osaka Amazing Passes what mode of transport (any passes/ transport card should we use?)    I understand that Osaka Amazing Passes has included most of the transports within Osaka- but does it included the train from Osaka to Kyoto and vice versa? Or from Osaka to Kansai Airport?    Then we will be staying 4 nights in Kyoto at Oriental Hotel. I am thinking to use hankyu tourist passes in Kyoto. From what I understand the transport in the city and transport to Kobe is included.    And we will come back to Osaka from Kyoto for another 2 nights stay at Kitahama.    We are thinking to go branded outlet near Osaka-mainly want to look for Northface. Any good recommendations?    We will be going to Universal Studio on the 11th December. Any transport passes we need for this 2 days in Osaka for going to outlet and also to Universal Studio.    I am sorry for being so lengthy.    Thanks in advance for your advises. ,HY C,Osaka,Malaysia
We are going next month for our 30th anniversary and will be staying at the Ritz Carlton as a special treat for 4 nights and then flying to Bangkok for the balance of our trip. We'd like to do some shopping and am thinking of Shinjuku but would like another place to try and find some good luxury buys without breaking the bank as well as some second-hand shopping places for luxury items. We would also like to do a couple 1/2 day trips or full day trips - maybe see Mount Fuji some temples and the gold Buddha?? My husband is in his 60's and has asthma and a bad hip so we don't want to walk for miles and miles each day. Might someone provide me with a few options that you think would be the most rewarding memorable and special for our anniversary trip that are not hours and hours away from Tokyo?

Hi All    I'm going to be collecting a JR Pass in Tokyo next month and then using it to ride the shinkansen to Kyoto and Osaka. Here's where I'm getting a bit confused.    I've read different accounts of how to use the JR Pass at the turnstiles. Some people say to insert BOTH the JR Pass AND Seat Reservation Ticket together at the same time whilst others say just insert the JR Pass ONLY. Which one is it? It seems both examples have worked.    Something else that worries me is that some people have said they've inserted their JR Passes into the turnstile and not had it returned!    Can people here who have used a JR Pass give their experience of using it please? ,Yee,Tokyo,England

Hi. I am traveling solo in first two weeks of January and have only booked flights in and out of Tokyo 12 days total. I have ski accommodation booked in Niseko 4 days after my arrival. I’ve got 4 days in Niseko and then and 4 days before flying out of Tokyo again. Any advice on the following:    1. Should I fly from Tokyo to Sapporo and then bus to Niseko or fly to New Chitose or some other mode (eg tour north from Tokyo)?    2. I have my own ski gear (everything) but think I will hire skis and take everything else as I don’t have powder skis. For 3 days skiing this should be fine. Any recommendations for good rental shops (my accommodation is Annapurna but I’ll ski across all resorts- I’m a level 5/6 skier)    3.

Hello. I'd like to get some feedback on our Tokyo-Fuji-Tokyo trip later in November.    We (2A + 2C) will be flying into Narita from Singapore arrival is early afternoon. We plan on heading straight to Fujikawaguchiko upon arrival. From the research I've done I can see that the only option we have (apart from car rental from Tokyo) to get to Fuji is to get on a Keio or Fujikyuko Express bus from Shinjuku Bus Terminal going to Kawaguchiko. I'd like to get some feedback on the following:    1) How much time should we set aside to clear immigration and customs? Will 2hrs be enough (land at 1400 clear customs by 1600)?  2) Is it better to take NEX or the Skyliner from Narita to Shinjuku Station?  3) Am I correct that the Ltd Exp Fuji Excursion does not have any trips leaving Shinjuku heading to Kawaguchiko in the afternoon?  4) If we purchase bus tickets for a specific timing but arrive at the bus terminal late will we be allowed on the next bus using our existing tickets (assuming there are available seats) or will we have to purchase new tickets?

Hello    I would like to use the luggage service from Osaka to Tokyo but need some information.    I will be staying in Osaka for 7 days and then spend 2 days around Mt.

Hi. We are a family of 4. Our two adult kids are 19 and 20 and we are two 55 year olds . We are staying in Shinjuku for 3 nights. Trying to figure out where to go in the neighbourhood for dinner and something to do at night like karaoke or something else …    I looked at all the posts for karaoke and couldn’t see one that suits that don’t want a private room but just want a night out . Any specific places in mind?    For dinner we have two vegetarians in the group. Wanted to do something that doesn’t feel like we are at home so was looking at memory lane? Would that be fun for dinner or is there a sit down place that would be better. Tried to find some place maybe where they have seating on pillows is it called sashika? Or where we grill our food at the table or can watch the cook at the grill eg on stools. Just looking for something with some atmosphere for diner- flexible about what that might look like but having trouble finding anything.    Any suggestions would be great thanks!

Hello    My wife and I are going to Tokyo with our 2 year old in late November for 6 days.    We've been to Japan 7-8 times before and Tokyo twice.    For this trip we are splitting between Yuen Bettei Daita in Setagaya and Mitsui Grand Nihonbashi for 2 different hotel and area experiences.    The second half hoping to mostly do eating and shopping in Nihonbashi/Ginza.    For the first half hoping to mostly enjoy the onsen at Yuen Bettei Daita and explore Shimokitazwa and other areas nearby.    But would much appreciate any tips on what we else we could do in this time. The primary interest would be good Japanese food and desserts interesting local neighborhoods nothing too hectic with the toddler.

Hi  I am soon travelling to Japan for 7 weeks with my son. We like to travel light with backpacks rather than suitcases. However the reality of 7 varied weeks means I'll have more than I need on a weekly basis.    The first 2 weeks I am on my own and hiking then leaving me with hiking poles that are cumbersome to transport.  My son will arrive and we will spend in December in cities cycling mountains and skiing. It's our first time in Japan and not sure of how much clothing we will need.  On previous extended trips in Europe I've posted luggage home for the comfort of our backs and the cost has been worth it. But I am unsure in Japan whether a better option may be to have it transported or stored. For example between Hiroshima and Osaka we have 3 days cycling the Shimanami Kaido and will not want to be carrying everything but if it were transported between these cities it cannot be stored at our Osaka accommodation for the 3 days until we arrive. My main concern is the hiking stuff needed at the start and the skiing clothes needed at the end which all seem bulky.  Could someone please offer advice or a resource to understand 'luggage management' in travelling across Japan . ,Katherine W,,

I'm visiting Japan for 3 weeks next year and I wanted some advice on the route I've come up with and any suggestions for things to add/remove.    So far it's:  5 nights in Tokyo 1 night in Takayama 1 night in Nagoya 3 nights in Kyoto 5 nights in Osaka (doing day trips to Kobe & Nara) 1 night in Okayama (stopping at Himeji Castle) 1 night in Hiroshima (visiting MiyaJima).    Then flying from Hiroshima back to Tokyo. I would like any advice but particularly I need advice on the next bit. When I fly back to Tokyo from Hiroshima I have 4 nights left. I would like to use this to visit places around Tokyo e.g. Hakone Mt. Fuji Nikko Nagano ect. Is there an obvious train route that would do almost a loop around places like this? It would be nice to stay overnight instead of doing day trips from Tokyo. Or would I need to keep travelling back in to Tokyo and change trains there?    Hope that all makes sense!

Hello!    My husband and I will be visiting Japan in early April 2024 for the very first time and we are so excited! We’re having trouble deciding how to spend our time in Japan. We will have 8 full days to explore (9 nights + a half day when we arrive).    I was originally thinking we could split our time between Tokyo Osaka and Kyoto with 3 nights in each city (not necessarily in that order). We are young and like to see as much as we can on our trips and used to a fast pace of travel hence wanting to stay in 3 different cities.    However I’m wondering if it would be better to spend our time only in two cities instead. Perhaps 4 nights in Tokyo and 5 nights in either Kyoto or Osaka (with a day trip to whichever city we don’t stay in). Or 5 nights in Tokyo and 4 nights somewhere else.    We’re torn about what to do and hoping to hear advice from other travelers on how to spend our first trip to Japan.    Thank you! ,Karin H,,Minneapolis...
Hello I'll be coming in from Narita and planning on taking the Narita Express to Tokyo station. I'll be with a group of 5 adults prob each with a backpack + luggage suitcase. Was considering taking TAXI to go from Tokyo Station to hotel. At the station taxi stops are there ways to get large taxi? Or would it be more efficient to split up and get to hotel separate taxis? ,Pablo G,Tokyo,

You can find my Tokyo Trip Report posted earlier.    Sat 10/14  My final morning in Tokyo! I woke up early and wandered around the neighborhood and went to a small local hotel for their breakfast set rice with nori miso soup mackerel fish and hot tea. Grabbed a delicious matcha latte at Starbucks and sat and read for a bit. Found it hard to find places to sit and read so Starbucks always came in handy for that.    Packed up and headed out to Tokyo Station to catch my shinkansen to Osaka. Had purchased a seat on Klook about two weeks prior an E seat as I'd heard this is where you want to sit to possibly catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji (I didn't more on that later). I left early because I wanted to go to Ramen Street at the station as well as have time to pick up an Ekiben.    I forgot how taxing it is to go on the subway and navigate through the stations with luggage. I had packed super light but even so my carry on size roller just seemed like too much. Maybe because it was a Saturday or maybe it's always like this but the crowds were out of control at Tokyo station. I tried figuring out which direction I should head to find Ramen Street and I just got completely and utterly overwhelmed. I had to find the entrance go outside walk away from the station and just sit for a good while.    I abandoned the Ramen Street idea and just decided to find a place to sit and have a beer which I did along with some French fries. This is the first time I saw on the menu such an odd thing...a beer where 95% of the glass was foam. So strange! Do the Japanese just really love their foam?    I don't know what it was about that day but I found the whole shinkansen experience overwhelming and difficult. I couldn't figure out which shinkansen entrance to go to or which platform....it was just a bad travel day. When I finally figured it out I sat down and promptly fell asleep missing any sighting of Mt. Fuji if there was one.    Osaka was a welcome sight. The Hattori Tenjin station was small only one way in/out and no crowds. My parents were there to greet me as well as my airbnb host. We walked about a minute to the apartment got settled in then finished the evening off with a good visit and pizza. Just what I needed! 12k steps.    Sunday 10/15  On the 15th of each month at the Chiong-Ji Temple the tezukuri ichi flea market is held. Stalls here sell a variety of hand made Kyoto arts and crafts including jewelry bags beads clothing masks and wonderful homemade breads and other food. My mom and I got there early and wandered around to each stall was a great variety and very unique.    We then spent some time eating our way through Nishiki Market: fried crab legs oysters octopus with a hard boiled quails egg stuffed in it's head (yes indeed!) cucumber pickles strawberry daifuku mochi! And probably more that I can't remember!    It didn't seem like we should eat more but we were right next to Macca House so we had to try the matcha and brown rice tea tiramisu. Really really delicious!    We then just did some wandering my mom loves SouSou clothes so we went to to that little area with a bunch of those stores poked around at Pontocho Alley then finally headed back home. Met up with my dad for an Okonomiyaki dinner and a nice evening stroll through the neighborhood looking at interesting things like a thrift shop with no employees open 24 hours...shopping is on your honor to check yourself out and pay. Amazing! 15k steps    Monday 10/16  Today was finally a relax day get some laundry done and give the legs a rest. We did take one walk to the Open Air Museum of Old Japanese Farmhouses we got there and....it was closed. Bummer! Check out closures of museums lots seem to be closed on Mondays.    We had a shabu shabu lunch took a trip to the grocery store for snacks and I discovered my new favorite canned Suntory highballs and the most delicious rice crackers ever. 11k steps    Tuesday 10/17  Dotonburi was on the list for today but we only did a brief blitz through stopping to eat takoyaki and crema ice cream at Excelsior Cafe. I say that if there is one (sweet) thing that you must eat in Japan...it's a crema ice cream cone. It's not just any Hokkaido soft serve...you have to find crema.    We explored Kuramon market and had a super fun conveyor sushi lunch at Kura. Then we went back home and I had a gigantic nap then went to the Teamlab Botanical garden which was beautiful and a really fun experience...and also voted by me as the 3rd loneliest thing to do solo (#1 was going on a ferris wheel #2 was watching to sunset at Shibuya Sky).    I went to The Most Deserted Ramen Bar In The World for a great bowl of ramen. I don't really know the story behind the name but their marketing department did a terrible job proofreading their bowls with their restaurant name emblazoned on it with the word Deserted unfortunately misspelled to Desarted. I saw a lot of misspellings but this one bothered me the most. 22k steps    Part 2 of Osaka trip coming up later! ,OneoftheJs,,California
Hi  We will be staying at Keisei Richmond Hotel Tokyo Kinshicho. Whats the most convenient/recommended method to make a day trip to Mt Fuji viewpoints?  Recommended stations to get off at and explore ard?  We are not early risers and cant make the early morning trains. So something to go ard 10ish AM and come back late evening would be ideal.    Taxi is prohibitive in cost - so what are our options as we'll be with 2 young kids. ,travel_love,Tokyo,"London, United..."

Hello. I have been asked to buy some Yatsuhashi/Otabe as I leave KIX. Previously before covid I just bought them before security and there was an abundance of choice. After arriving domestically yesterday I noticed that because of the terminal redevelopment there are few if any shops open at KIX. Can anyone tell me if there are any shops selling Yatsuhashi after international security? From memory there is very little? Or should I take a trip to Kyoto just before I leave and buy them there? Thanks. ,MelbourneSensei,Osaka,Melbourne

We will be staying at Prince Gallery for a few days then take the Shinkansen to Kyoto for two days. When we return to Tokyo we will be staying at the Prince Sakura Tower.    Would there happen to be bag storage lockers or bag storage service at Shinagawa station? That way we can take our smaller duffel to Kyoto and leave our large heavy bag at the station to retrieve upon return.    I will check and see if the Prince Sakura will store our bag for two days if they verify our reservation. But I'm not sure they will. So just looking into the options.

I bought exchange vouchers in September from Klook for a 14 day JR pass for my wife an I and I guess I did not realize that it would be impossible to reserve seats online if done this way. From what I understand the only way to reserve seats online for the Shinkansen is by buying the JRpass directly from their website. The only way I can reserve seats is when I actually get to Japan on the 21st of December and exchange my order for the actual pass (correct me if I’m wrong here). I will be traveling to hakone on the 23rd of December Kyoto on the 25th Takeyama on the 30th and back to Tokyo on the 1st. So if that is the case my question is how likely will it be that I won’t be able to find a seat for my wife and I given that we won’t be able to reserve seats until just days before our train rides? especially for the train to and from takeyama which is during new years? ,Greg Seitter,,Kansas City...
For our departure from Narita airport Terminal 1 I have a few questions about sending my luggage ahead in order to avoid carrying it on the train. Our hotel is near Kinshicho Station and I see on Google maps that there is a convenient Sobu Line (Rapid) train direct from Kinchisho to Narita. However I know this is a local commuter train which will not have racks for storing full size suitcases.  I am therefore considering asking the hotel to forward my luggage to Narita a day earlier. I will be flying out on ANA Airlines from Terminal 1. My question is where would the luggage collection point/points be at Terminal 1? Would there be a long queue to collect the luggage? How long does this process usually take? And how reliable is this service? I know Japan is extremely efficient and reliable but I still have to ask since if my luggage doesn’t reach on time it will be a major problem. Finally what would be the approximate cost for a full size suitcase weighing 23Kg?  It would be grateful for any advice/information. Thank you. ,fnmistry,Tokyo,

So my plan was to take the Aoniyoshi limited express train to Nara from Kyoto. I now realize there’s an 11:00 and a 1:00. I’m going to go to FumishiInari at 7am and then go into some of the shops afterwards around 9 depending opening times. Taking a taxi from there to Kyoto station is about 12 minutes. Finding the train platform etc who knows how long that’ll take. I feel like if I reserve the 11:00 I’ll be pressed for time and be stressed. Plus I may have to rush through Fumishi Inari. If I take the 1:00 will that give me enough time to visit Nara? My plan is a 1/2 day there. Sun sets at 4:30 dark at 5:30. The last Aoniyoshi train is at 2:30 so thinking I should take a JR train back. Do you think I’ll  Need reservations for a JR train back? (No pass). I’ll be going Monday December 4th. Should I scrap the idea of the Aoniyoshi train and just take. Jr train with many more times available? Nothing is simple in planning! Haha ,Lisa W,Kyoto,Huntington Beach CA

Hi all I have a few questions on the Sagano Romantic Train:    - Is it advisable to pre-book or should it be fine to buy on the day?

I will arrive at Miyajima for a full day on the island (arrive late at night) and plan a full day on the island leaving in evening the next day. I don’t want to feel rushed and want to explore the island and hike up/down Mt Misen. Should I spend a second day? Is there more hiking that is worthwhile? Up the third path around other areas? Or would the time be better spent elsewhere in Kyoto. I have 4 days in Kyoto and another day in Hiroshima. It is just a good deal of effort to get to the island so want to do it justice.

Hi - sorry for the vague title. I’m planning a trip for a group of friends (all ladies). We will start in Tokyo then a couple of nights in Hakone region and stay in a Ryokan. Then on to Kyoto for about 4 or 5 nights. I love Kyoto and I’m keen to show my friends how beautiful it is.  Planning a day trip to Hiroshima and Miyajima Is. And also a trip to Nara.  ButI’m not sure about Osaka. All I see from my research is a big city that has Universal Studios (not for us) an Aquarium (not really interested) a castle (will see plenty in Kyoto) and the Dotonburi area (which looks a bit ordinary from photos). Is there something I’m missing from my research that could tempt us there?  We will fly out of Osaka -but can catch the Limobus from Kyoto easily enough.

We are coming to Japan for the first time in mid-May with our two kids in their early 20s for 9 nights and I would really appreciate some help with our itinerary.    At the moment my rough itinerary is:    Day 1 - arrive Haneda Airport early morning and staying in Shinjuku. Explore Tokyo  Day 2 - explore Tokyo  Day 3 - head to Lake Kawaguchi for a night (for Mt Fuji views and countryside/walking)  Day 4 - travel to Kyoto and base ourselves there for 5 nights  Day 5 - Explore Kyoto  Day 6 - day trip to Hiroshima by bullet train  Day 7 - Explore Kyoto  Day 8 - Day trip to Nara or Osaka  Day 9 - Return to Tokyo for final night before catching plane home    My questions are:    1. Should we go to Lake Kawaguchi at all or is Hakone easier/better given that we are travelling on to Kyoto (this looks difficult from Lake Kawaguchi???) And is 1 night enough? Otherwise we could reduce our stay in Kyoto to 4 nights and omit Nara/Osaka perhaps?    2. We’d love recommendations for an onsen with views of Mt Fuji that is affordable.    3. Given that the Japan Rail pass has increased in price should we buy one or just book individual rail journeys and combine with other forms of transport. For example I was thinking we could get the Highway Express bus from Shinjuku in Tokyo straight to Lake Kawaguchi.    4. What are the top things you’d recommend we do in Tokyo with so little time (and jet lag as we’re coming from the uk)?    Thanks so much for your advice. ,ANNE W,,Harpenden

Hi    I am traveling to Japan at the end of November and will be staying 2 weeks.    I have been researching my heart out and can't find anything specifically for the 2 prescriptions I absolutely need to bring with me.    The 2 prescriptions are:    Escitalopram 10mg tablets (generic form of Lexapro)  Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg tablets      The Escitalopram will be less than a months worth since I only take 1 a day and get it filled every 30 days.    However the Hydroxyzine I take only as needed if I'm having a panic attack or severe anxiety. I only have 27 pills left of this prescription and I don't forsee getting it refilled before my trip. So I'm not sure if that quantity works for the less than one month amount or not.    The prescription comes with 90 pills and I can take it every 6 hours so to me it seems like 90 pills is a month's quantity if I had to take it as often as it is allowed.    I hope this makes sense. I just want to make sure I can bring these medications with me as this will be my first time leaving my country and my first time on a plane. So I expect to have some anxiety during this process.    Also if I am able to have these medications do I need to declare them on the Visit Japan Website? I've filled out all the information needed to get both QR codes however I want to make sure I'm not leaving anything out. ,Mackenzie T,,

We are not looking at late nights in nightclubs!

I was all set to book my romance car tickets for the observation deck at exactly one month in advance at 6pm my time which is 10 am Japan time. I decided to “practice” a day ahead of time. Well to my surprise the seats were already on sale! In fact 2 more days after my date were on sale! So that meant I wasn’t able to reserve the observation deck seats as they sell out within minutes. So if you want those seats you better keep checking days ahead of time in case they go on sale early. I had no problem getting other seats just not my first choice. I even counted days just to check if it was 30 days as opposed to 4 weeks ahead and it was like 33 days ahead or so. Anyways I just wanted to let you all know. ,Lisa W,Hakone-machi,Huntington Beach CA
My family and I will be visiting Japan in mid-March to early April next year. Since this will be our third trip to Japan we're trying to include at least some destinations that are not in the standard list of highlights. Our tentative itinerary is:    [Arrive HND]  Tokyo (4 nights)  Fujiyoshida (2 nights)  [Fly from Tokyo to Takamatsu]  Takamatsu (3 nights)  Okayama (3 nights)  Kanazawa (3 nights)  Kyoto (4 nights)  [Depart ITM]    [The post-price-increase Japan-wide rail pass doesn't make sense but the JR West 5 day Kansai Wide Area Pass and JR West 7 day Kansai - Hokuriku Area Pass are potentially useful for this itinerary.]      Any comments/suggestions would be appreciated as we're uncertain whether some components of the itinerary make sense. Specific concerns include:    • Are two days appropriate for Fujiyoshida?    • The best balance of time between Okayama and Takamatsu is not so clear - it seems possible that Takamatsu deserves more time or even that it would be better to replace Okayama. The reason for tentatively including Okayama are:  ▫ Korakuen Garden  ▫ Handayama Botanical Garden for sakura  ▫ Kibi Plain cycling route (not entirely clear whether conditions will be good in late March)  ▫ Day trip to Himeji  ▫ Easier access to Naoshima than from Takamatsu    • Is Kurashiki worthwhile at that time of year? Apparently the trees along the river a likely to still be bare in March greatly reducing how attractive it is.    • Kanazawa is a big detour but we really enjoyed our previous visit and it's not clear that any of the alternatives compete with it. It arguably make sense to move Kanazawa to directly after the Kantō region so that the JR West Hokuriku Arch Pass could be used but we've moved it close to the end to maximize the probability of hitting the sakura while there.      For what it's worth other destinations we considered and tentatively rejected were:    • Matsue and or Hagi (far from the rest of the itinerary and likely to still be rather cold at the end of March)  • Takayama and Shirakawa (considering the altitude likely to still be rather cold at the end of March)  • Matsuyama (it makes sense to choose between Matsuyama and Takamatsu and Takamatsu seems to have more to offer)  • Koyasan (visited previously and considering the altitude likely to still be rather cold at the end of March) ,bwnm,,"Santa Fe, New Mexico"
Hi - I've been looking at both these forums and other sites and am increasingly confused at the breadth of hotels in Tokyo and would welcome any advice.  We (myself husband and adult son) will be there next March for 3 nights at the end of a cruise (19-22nd).  We've not been in Tokyo for a long time so will want to explore the city - see some sights walk the streets some temples and gardens/ parks. We're not big shoppers or in need of a lot of nightlife and are very happy to use the metro/ public transport to get around. Is Tokyo bay too far out be be a good bet?  Our budget is around 90k Yen per night (if necessary would happily pay less) - if we could get 2 rooms for that it would be great but if we need to share one room to get a better hotel location/ experience we can do that. ,HelenM,Tokyo,"Edinburgh, United..."

Kindly advise the easiest/quickest way to get from Tokyo city to Lake Kawaguchiko. I have booked an onsen hotel at Maruei (hope that's a good location).    Will be going to Kyoto thereafter - which train station should I go to catch Shinkansen and how do we get from Lake Kawaguchiko to this train station?

Hi !  during our trip we had planned to send our luggage from Kyoto to Kanazawa and then from Kanazawa to Tokyo taking only our backpacks with us in the days between. Visiting the Yamato website however I can't find Kanazawa among their destinations. Do you know is there any other company that deals with that area? or should I organize in another way?  Thanks ,Viki L,,Italy

When travelling around Tokyo by public transport (train) do I need to buy a ticket for each leg of the journey or is it all on one ticket or can I buy both tickets at the beginning? I give an example of a journey - from Ueno Station take the Keihin-Tohoku Line to Kanda Station then change there to the Chuo Line to get to Musashi-Koganei Station. What do I buy at Ueno Station? ,Richard R,Tokyo,"Paulhan, France"
As some of you who have been helping me know I have an extra day at the end of my trip that I want to fill with something other than Osaka. I had kind of decided on Nara as a daytrip. But now I have been doing some more research and think Mount Koya sounds extremely interesting instead. But pretty much everything I have read says that an overnight is a big part of the experience and I would like to do that. It's the logistics that have me stymied and I don't know if this is even feasible.    If I did this I would spend the last night of my trip at Mt. Koya. Is there any way I can send my suitcase a day ahead of time from my Osaka hotel to Itami airport? Then I could just travel with my backpack for the overnight.    Assuming I could do that (and find a good temple accommodation) from what I can tell it would be close to 3 hours to travel to Koya san from my Osaka hotel which is located very close to Esaka station. This would be on a Sunday at the end of November which I expect will be a crazy busy time. Then I could have the rest of the day to visit the Koya san area. I'd spend Sunday night at a temple and hope to visit the illuminated cemetery that night. On Monday morning I would attend the early morning Buddhist service have breakfast and then make my way back to Itami airport. My flight leaves there at 14:00 for my international connection from Tokyo.    So bottom line I have 3 questions:    1. What can I do with my suitcase so I don't need to lug it along with me? Can I ship it from my Osaka hotel to Itami airport and how would I arrange this?    2. Is this even a feasible itinerary?    3. I absolutely need to make that Monday 14:00 flight because it is the start of my return leg to the US. Can I safely stay overnight at Koya san on Sunday and be guaranteed to make that flight? Or it this just too risky so I'd be better just staying at my Osaka hotel Sunday night and even though I'd prefer not to making this a day trip. (I could possibly change my plane ticket and go back to Osaka for Monday night and fly out on Tuesday but it's not something I really want to do.)    Thank you in advance for your assistance. ,peter s,Osaka,
Hi! After a good bit of research I have a draft itinerary and would welcome feedback. We're two adults and two kids 5 and 10. Our kids are good travelers but this will be their longest ever flights. I don't want to push them too terribly hard but still want to see some highlights. Of course some things below are dependent on availability/tickets. Hubby and I have only been to Japan on short layovers so are very excited for this two-week adventure.    My sons aren't big gamers but they do like Pokemon Naruto and the Ghibli movies we've watched. Also Ninjago and Avatar: The Last Air Bender! They are adventurous eaters and pretty good walkers. And 8-10 mile day is very doable but likely not every day. We were just in New York amidst large crowds and foul weather and they were troopers.    Are Hakone and Nikko good destinations in late March or is there a good chance of very iffy weather?    Day 1 - Land at Haneda at night stay at airport hotel  Day 2 - Fly to KIX train to Kyoto check into Kyoto Station hotel  Day 3 - Fushimi-Inari + Ninja/Samuri class  Day 4 - 6-hour private tour likely to include Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Gion  Day 5 - Osaka including Sumo competition  Day 6 - Arashiyama or Himeji Castle  Day 7 - Nara  Day 8 - Kobo-san Market + Railway Museum + train to Hakone check into Gora hotel  Day 9 - Hakone  Day 10 - Hakone + train to Tokyo (lodging TBD)  Day 11 - Ghibli Museum + new Teamlab Borderless  Day 12 - Odaiba  Day 13 - Nikko (lodging TBD)  Day 14 - Nikko  Day 15 - Edo-Tokyo Museum + Senso-ji Temple + Skytree  Day 16 - Flex morning + 5pm Narita departure    Really can't wait and feel so very fortunate that we're taking our first Asia family vacation. TIA! ,REBChicago,,"Chicago, Illinois"
Hello!  My wife I and our 10yo daughter are planning a one week trip to Kyoto late November coinciding with the US Thanksgiving week. We will be staying at a hotel within a few minutes walk from the Kyoto station for 7 nights during this period. I would appreciate your help with the planning for this trip. The main purpose of course is autumn foliage viewing and we are planning to take a 7 day JR-West All area pass to help with all our travel in the area.    We plan to make two day trips to (a) Hiroshima + Miyajima & (b) Nara + Osaka. Other than this our plan for now is to spend 4 days sightseeing around Kyoto visiting the foliage viewing spots temples gardens Arashiyama Fushimi Inari etc.    (i) I came across Kanazawa as being another potential day trip destination from Kyoto especially since we will be able to take the express train with our pass. Is it a good idea to cut our time in Kyoto to 3 days to add another day trip to Kanazawa? We are willing to consider if Kanazawa offers something different to see compared to Kyoto.    (ii) I understand that Kyoto is going to be very crowded during this period. what is the best way to travel around Kyoto to visit these sights?    (iii) Due to the crowded season is it better to reserve train seats for the trip to Hiroshima and potentially Kanazawa?    (iv) Since Thursday Nov 23 is a public holiday in Japan should I expect more crowds in Kyoto for the 'long' weekend and plan the daytrips for these days?    (v) Does JR West pass cover public transportation within Kyoto ? Else are there day passes available so we don't have to keep buying tickets every time?    we will be tracking the peak foliage maps and are open to last minute trips accordingly.    Many thanks! ,trojansoldier,Kyoto,San Francisco...

Hello!  We will be traveling to Japan next March. Spending 6 nights in Tokyo and 6 nights in Kyoto. I'm trying to plan some RC centered activities and day trips for my husband and sons. I think they'd like to go out to Tsukuba RC Arena one day. Our hotel is in Shibuya. It looks like it's a 2+ hour train trip to get there or a 50 minute drive. Does that sound right? Would you recommend hiring a driver to get them there in the AM? Then I'm thinking they could take the express bus(?) back to Akihabara and do some RC shopping in the afternoon. We will go to the Tamiya Plafactory and the Kyosho Village at some point as well. Am I missing anything super RC fun in Toyko? We may take a day trip into Osaka to do a bit more RC shopping but unless there is something special near Kyoto I'm hoping to get the RC stuff done in Tokyo. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Trying to figure this out has been a bit more complicated than I expected. ,Hallie N,,

Looking through my itinerary I have us looking at quite a few night views which considering we're travelling in Dec-Jan might be overkill. I've added them to the list mostly based on reviews on sites like Japan Guide ranking them as amongst Japan's premier night views.  Wondering what people's thoughts are stick with the plan or could some be dropped?  - Shibuya Sky (we'd be doing this after sunset rather than trying to get in at prime sunset time)  - Mount Inasayama at Nagasaki  - JR Tower Observatory at Sapporo  - Mount Hakodate  Thanks! ,Renee1901,,
We will be doing the Hakone loop as a daytrip from Shinjuku.  I'm hoping to take the 7.57am departure but I think our itinerary will still be somewhat tight.

If on the day I have to drop one from the list which would you recommend? We're travelling as 2 adults plus a 14yo and 10yo?  Thanks for your help. ,Renee1901,,

Hi everyone    I'm looking for some advice on how to order the Kanazawa Takayama and Shirakawago part of our itinerary. We are trying to do this in a loop beginning and ending in Tokyo.    I was planning to travel from Tokyo to Kanazawa by train. I am unsure of the best way to get from Kanazawa to Takayama. Should I go by train or bus? We would also like to go to Shirakawago - can I do this on the way from Kanazawa to Takayama or is a day trip from Takayama better?    I could devote 4 nights to this region if necessary or cut it back to 3. The dates I'm looking at are December 1 - 4 (or 1-3 if it works to take a day off this part of the trip).    Also is it worth including Matsumoto - and where would it best fit in this itinerary?    We have JR passes but I am okay about using the bus when it is the better option.    Thanks in advance for your help. Any input will be very gratefully received. ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"
For our Dec-Jan trip we’re aiming to bring as compact luggage as possible so we’ll have to wash maybe every 5 or 6 days.  All our hotels have self-serve laundry rooms.  On our last trip I found myself chained to the laundry room late at night on a few occasions and am hoping to avoid it with this trip. As our itinerary is usually fairly busy I think I’ll have to plan ahead. Any tips on things people have noticed seem to work best in this regard?  Also just wondering how things work if we need something washed that can’t go through the machine. We’re staying in what I’d call the better end of business hotels which don’t have their own laundry facilities. Do these places have arrangements to send things out for laundering or is it something I’d have to work out myself? Possibly the dullest of topics but thank you! ,Renee1901,,

I am planning to visit Kawaguchiko (from Tokyo) between 13/Nov and 16/Nov. I have intentionally not booked tickets for the trip because I very much want to get a clear view of Mt. Fuji without it being covered by clouds. So I will check the weather forecast a few days prior and then decide on which day to go. I know weather forecasts may not be totally accurate but at least they may be reasonably accurate. I’m willing to take the chance.    So for the journey I know the best way to get to get from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko is by bus from Shinjuku. Or the Fuji Excursion trains direct from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko. However in case these buses and trains are already fully booked are there other trains to Kawaguchiko or are there any other means of transport? Thanks in advance. ,fnmistry,Tokyo,

I have had a last minute change of plans in what was already going to be a very last minute trip to Japan so I am doing a two week tour that ends in Osaka with 2 nights there. From the research I have done it doesn't seem that Osaka is a place I will have much interest in. Food fun/entertainment and shopping aren't big draws for me and from my reading that kind of sums up Osaka. The 1st night we'll do a walking tour in the Dotonbori district. The next day there will be a morning walking tour of the Shinsaibashi area and the rest of the day is free until dinner in the evening. The tour ends the next morning. I think the local castle might be a way to fill the empty afternoon but that's it.    Here is my dilemma. I need to book plane tickets in the next day or so. Flying back to the US the day the tour ends will cost me $1000 more than flying back either the day before the tour ends or the day after. Obviously I won't pay that premium for that one day. So my choices are to (a) just leave from Osaka Itami airport on the second to the last day of the tour missing the day in Osaka. Or I can stay in Japan an extra day after the end of the tour. If so what would I do because I know I don't want to spend it in Osaka? I will have already had 4 days in Kyoto. I enjoy art history gardens architecture nature just wandering in scenic locales.    Here are some thoughts I have had if I do decide to add on a day. Go to Himejo castle. How much of the day would that fill? Go to Nara (however I will already have spent some time hiking in the rural countryside south of Nara). If I decide to stay an extra day for either place I assume I should I just commute from my Osaka hotel.    Ultimately I need to get to Haneda airport for my flight to the US. Right now the easiest way to do this seems to be to take a flight from Osaka which will then connect with a flight to the US from Tokyo. If there would be an interesting place somewhere between Osaka and Tokyo that I could easily get to from Osaka and then easily get to Haneda airport I'd be willing to look at that too. I am trying to remind myself that this will be the end of a demanding two week trip and I will probably be tired so I don't want to add too much hassle.    Do you have any ideas or suggestions? ,peter s,Osaka,
Hello everyone-    Looking for help on a 2 week itinerary for November. I know someone will post the link to the Japan website for suggestions but I’m coming here but I’m looking for actual opinions.    We want to utilize the 2 weeks but also do not want to move every day or every other day. I was considering as follows but open:    Tokyo 3 days  Hakone 1-2 days  Matsutomo 1 day  Takayama 2 days  Kyoto 4 days  Day trip to Nara  Possibke day trip to Osaka  Back to Tokyo for final day    Are any of the locations too similar and it would be better to include a location not mentioned? More or less time in a lotion? Must visits not included? We just didn’t include Hiroshima because it is the further point.    Thanks! ,Kristine F,,Connecticut

Will Kawaguchiko be very crowded on Sunday 12/Nov 2023 compared to Monday 13th or Tuesday 14th?    I was originally planning to go on Monday/Tuesday but that might be difficult and I may have to go on Sunday instead. If the crowds won’t be much different between Sunday and Mon/Tue then I will go on Sunday. But if the crowds will be much less on Mon/Tue then I will make an effort to go on those days. Thanks in advance. ,fnmistry,Fujikawaguchiko-machi,

Hi everyone  We'll be in Kyoto from 19 December and considering this scenic train ride. But I'm wondering if it will be worthwhile at this time? Will the trees likely be bare by then?

Hi  Thanks in advance for any advice provided! I see that Osaka Castle is quite a distance from a lot of other sights in Osaka. There seems to be a river cruise that goes from the castle back to Dotonburi. Is that correct? Just looking for an alternate way than the metro each way. Where would I find a timetable for this cruise (if it exists)... ,Cathy R,Osaka,"Sydney, Australia"
Hello everyone    I was looking for some help in Ueno area near our hotel ICI Hotel Ueno Okinachimachi that we will be staying at later this month.    1. Are there any food halls (like an iSetan food hall for example) or any restaurants or cafes around for breakfasts or quick lunch in the area? Does anyone happen to know?  2. On the day of our departure we have to get to Narita by 6 am. During the day we would’ve taken a train from Okachimachi station (700 mtrs from hotel) to Tokyo Station and then Narita Express but that doesn’t seem to be an option that early in the morning. Any advice on how to reach Narita by 6 am from ICI Hotel Ueno Okachimachi? (Example Uber to Kuramae station on Asakusa line and then train to Narita)?    Sorry if this is confusing but I have been trying to get my head around this for the past few days realising this hotel location was not ideal for us.    Thank you in advance ,NeverJetLagged,Tokyo,"Singapore, Singapore"
For this pass- may I reserve tickets online in advance before arriving in Japan?    Is it only valid for Hida non reserved seats?  Is one able to book a reserved seat and use the pass as base ticket?  I tried reading but can’t quite understand how the base ticket works.    Thanks in advance. ,orchidT,Takayama,
I don't have a credit card consider buying this card in Auckland has anyone tried it?  Does prezzy card work in Japan? Thanks ,Allen,,
First time in Japan no time to learn any more than a few basic phrases but of course it's important to be polite. In some countries like the UK you can just walk into a shop and say Have you got...?. In others like France you would say Good morning. Have you got...? Well I prefer bread that doesn't contain sugar and I can easily learn the words for bread without sugar but do I say Hello/Good morning in the bakers before I ask for it or is it enough just to smile and make a slight bow? Final question when I've got my bread do I just walk out of the bakers or do I say Goodbye? ,Paul F,,
My husband & I live in the US and he bought tickets through StubHub to a concert in Shibuya. The concert is about 5 weeks away and we leave for Japan in 4 weeks. He's worried now because the ticket seller sold us physical tickets which have to be shipped. The seller might ship them to our US address in plenty of time but maybe not (for some reason hubby can't contact the seller directly only StubHub). The StubHub website also gave an option to ship the tickets to where we might be staying in Tokyo. Since we don't have a hotel booked yet is there something like a FedEx office near Shibuya that might be able to hold the tickets for us until we arrive? Is it possible perhaps that the venue (LINE CUBE SHIBUYA) could hold the tickets for us? Please share your ideas. We don't speak Japanese which makes this transaction even harder. Thank you! ,S Pam S,Tokyo,Half Moon Bay...
Hi  We as family are traveling to kyoto next month . We would like to know the best way to go to Nara deer park from kyoto . Kindly suggest on how to plan this day trip . ,HP,Kyoto Prefecture,
We have just completed a wonderful trip to Japan. Sincere thanks to all in this forum who has helped us in planning this trip. Sharing a few points which might help others..    1. We were a bit apprehensive about finding our way in big stations/ other places due to language issue.But it was perfectly managable. We always aporoached the information centres and they guided us well.  People are super- helpful in any case. However keep google translator handy. And reach train/ bus stations well in advance.    2 We spent 4 nights in Tokyo two nights in Kamikochi and four nights in Kyoto. Visited Shirkawago on the way from Kamikochi to Kyoto. Would like to mention following places in particular..    a) Teamlab planet in Tokyo an immersive digital reality show.  Not seen anything similar anywhere else.  b) Shibuya crossing.. world's busiest.  As suggested by someone here we sat in the Starbucks here sipping coffee and enjoying the sight below. We went just before the evening. It was magical.  c) Kamikochi.. a beautiful scenic and quiet hill resort five hours by bus ( or combination of train + bus) from Tokyo. Spend at least one night here. You can go for trekking if you stay longer.    4. Kyoto.. One of the most beautiful towns we have visited. Its greenery old fashioned houses and temples are fascinating. Try to spend more time here.  Thanking all once again.. shall be glad to answer any query. ,biswadip,,"Mumbai, India"
Hello    I'm considering going to Japan mid-November and I was wondering if anyone could help me with some questions:  1. I've read that the weather is fairly nice and I may get lucky and see fall foliage. Has anyone been in November? Was that a good time? I'm thinking of going to Tokyo and Kyoto. I only have about 8 days.  2. If I go as a solo female traveler is it overall safe?  3. Can I get around with no knowledge of Japanese?    Any other advice or recommendations will be greatly appreciated.    Thanks in advance! ,Iulia (Yu-lee-ya),,"Fairfax, Virginia"

Hi looking into getting the Hakone Free Pass for January. We’d like to get the Romancecar from Shinjuku one-way only (going on to Kyoto from Hakone).    Looking on the Odakyu Line app it shows ‘Round Trip Ticket’ and ‘Hakone Area Only’ but not clear if this includes the train from Shinjuku (can’t get any more detail til a month before)    Also is it recommended to book tickets online for travel on 10 January or can we risk waiting til we get to Tokyo on the 6th and book in person?    Would welcome some advice please! ,Figgenbaum,,"Chesham, UK"
I saw a blog post that indicated you can walk from Ryuchin Shrine southeast of Nara to Muro-ji  https://www.awalkandalark.com/nara-hikes-muroji-temple/  in what appears to be a trek along the Fukatani rriver. Is this a legit walking trail? Or is it off track and a bit risky? If its safe is it worth doing and how lonog to make the walk? ,Mars B,,

So we were misinformed by out Travel Agent that JR West area pass will cover Kyoto to Takayama trip. It is my fault that I did not double check since I saw Kanazawa and Toyama are in the map. My bad!!!    So originally I was planning to take Hida 25 direct to Takayama but it is actually only covered to Maibara station. I think the upgrade would be too expensive like 6000 jpy ish (?) per person...    The other option is to use JR West area pass to Toyama station and pay about $3140 jpy fr Toyama to Takayama. I'm afraid I have no choice? We will be travelling with my parents and 2 kids... So 6 ppl in total. Are there any other better options?    Thanks very much in advance ,MelbDude,Kyoto,"Melbourne, Australia"

I am planning Japan trip in early November. I have not decided whether to do a guided tour with Gate 1 /Traflgar /Globus or do it on my own. we would be 2 couples in our 50s and 60s .if we do it in our own which I am leaning towards then can purchase a 15 day first class jr rail pass .I am thinking of visiting and staying in Tokyo Hakone Takayama Kanazawa Kyoto and Osaka . Some questions  please —1) is it worth visiting Nakamura and the giant Buddha statue there on a short trip from Tokyo will be seeing Todaiji in Nara for sure .2) what about Matsumoto ?and it’s castle 3) how to travel from Tokyo to Takayama /Kanazawa and which one to do first and then go from there to Kyoto in between will do a day trip tour from one of the 2 places to the thatched village Shirakawago 4) I will be ending trip in Osaka and skipping Hiroshima I think .Your thoughts please thanks ,vickicork,,"Tampa, Florida"
Planning a three week trip to Japan from Australia either April or May. This will be our second visit to Japan. Last time we did the main itinerary Tokyo Mt Fuji HiroshimaKyoto Osaka and also a few wonderful days walking part of the Nakasendo trail. This time we would like to visit different places. We were thinking of flying into Tokyo train to Kyoto then heading North to Kanazawa and the Japanese alps. We would like to do some walking and love the old wooden villages. Any tips on where to go how to get there would be appreciated. Also if using buses to travel are these a safe option. I am a nervous passenger so I have to ask.  Any other tips and ideas would also be appreciated ,Mezdavies,,"Melbourne, Australia"
Which are the best weather forecast sites for Tokyo and Kawaguchiko? In particular I would like to visit Kawaguchiko on a day when the forecast predicts there will be no cloud cover(mid November).

Hi all  Just booked tickets to Japan for March next year and starting to put together an itinerary (just so excited!) but so many questions even after scouring through most recent forum entries and countless videos on YouTube. Rates are already quite high given high season so want to lock down the itinerary sooner than later. Pls help!    Family of 4 2 kids 5 & 14  Planned itinerary:  Day 1: Mar 22 - Arriving in NRT staying near Shinjuku stn.  Day 2: Mar 23 - Tokyo sights.  Day 3: Mar 24 - Day trip to Kawaguchiko on the JR Limited Express train.  Day 4: Mar 25 - Tokyo sights.  Day 5: Mar 26 - Tokyo to Osaka by Shinkansen. Osaka sights staying near Shin-Osaka stn.  Day 6: Mar 27 - Day trip to Himeji.  Day 7: Mar 28 - Osaka to Kyoto. Kyoto sights staying in Gion.  Day 8: Mar 29 - Kyoto sights.  Day 9: Mar 30 - Kyoto sights.  Day 10: Mar 31 - Kyoto to Tokyo by Shinkansen. Tokyo sights staying near Shinjuku stn.  Day 11: Apr 1 - Tokyo sights.  Day 12: Apr 2 - Flying out of NRT.    Q1: Planning to get a 3-day Tokyo Wide Pass to start on day 1 to cover NEX to Tokyo (~JPY 3250?) day 2 travel within Tokyo - Shinjuku Shibuya Akihabara etc. (no idea how much) & day 3 round-trip to Kawaguchiko (~JPY 7500?). Does this make sense? Or should I just pay as I go?    Q2: If I do end up buying a Tokyo Wide Pass is there a chance I may not be able to buy / exchange at the station to catch NEX as my flight is scheduled to arrive at NRT only around 1930 hours?    Q3: For my itinerary above I went online to an online fare calculator (daisuki) and arrived at ~JPY40000 for Day 5 - Day 10 (Tokyo - Osaka - Himeji - Kyoto - Tokyo). However I do not have a clear estimate on how much I might end up spending on local short trips. Is it worth purchasing the 7-day JR Pass? Even if it comes slightly lower than JPY50000 I might go for it if the convenience factor is considerably high given we will travel with kids + maybe 2 bags for the longer trips.    Q4: Since its peak season should I really purchase a child pass for my younger kid (5 years old)? will there be unreserved seats still available that she can use?    Q5. Any big ticket items I'm missing in terms of budget planning outside airfare JR/train fares stay? Is street food expensive?    Q6: How much cash should I carry on daily sightseeing trips? Do most restaurant / street food shops accept cards?    Q7: For Kyoto I saw a recommendation to buy a bus & subway one day pass. Is this required if I do end up purchasing a JR Pass?    Q8: Similarly is it a good idea to purchase a SUICA/ICOCA IC card on top of JR Pass? If JR Pass does not make sense from what I've read it seems like having an IC card would be a good idea. Will my 5-year old also need an IC card for traveling on trains?    Q9: Which English language apps should I get for local food recommendations? (no food restrictions)    and finally..  Q10: Any suggestions on the itinerary above? While flight tickets / hotels are booked hotel reservations are cancelable if need be.    Your inputs are much appreciated! ,Vineeth P,,"Hong Kong, China"
Very divided between these two hotels. They are right near each other so location is comparable. Hotel Alza looks much nicer in online photographs but reviews are good for both of them with Gion Misen having more reviews between the two. Somehow Google Maps shows Hotel Alza as a 2-star hotel and Gion Misen as a 3-star hotel even though they seem to offer pretty similar things.    It appears to be much much harder to get a reservation at Hotel Alza Kyoto. Is that an endorsement for it? Indeed I booked at Gion Misen already because there was no availability from May 15-18 at Hotel Alza. However I just received a hotel alert that a room opened up at Hotel Alza and I booked it and so now I have reservations at both places.    The room I got at Hotel Alza is much bigger than my room at Gion Misen so all in all it seems like a no brainer to cancel the Gion Misen reservation. And yet... before I let go of the Gion Misen reservation I just wanted to make sure this was the right call. Does anyone have experience with both of these properties? I have read the reviews but still feel like I need to cover my bases by asking the forum. :) Thanks! ,Elana_K,Kyoto,"Chicago, Illinois"
Hello    We did a day trip to Nikko a few year ago but it was during summer. Now we are planning to go back but this time it will be 3D/2N in February (winter).

We arrive in Tokyo airport late afternoon and want to take bullet train to Osaka that evening. Do we need to purchase tickets in advance or can we get them when we arrive? Concerned about reserving seats in case there's a flight delay. Also we will be in Osaka for 3 days and want to do some side trips - do we purchase a regional pass for that? Or cheaper to just buy individual tickets? Thanks! ,elizann1234,,"Mount Vernon, Iowa"
We will be arriving at Sapporo Airport on Nov 28th and some of our party (including children) have never experienced temperatures below about 22°C. Of course they will be wearing or carrying winter clothes on the plane but still I'd like to know whether you walk straight off the plane into one of those 'tunnels' (which may not be entirely heated) or whether (as at some airports) you might get straight off the plane into the cold air and maybe have to wait a couple of minutes outdoors for a bus to the terminal. As far as I can see from the statistics it could be around 0°C but even if it's +5°C it will be freezing cold for those who aren't used to it and they should definitely wear winter hats both adults and children. ,Paul F,Hokkaido,
Hiya Tokyo forum    We have just had 4 amazing days in Tokyo and are back for 2 more at the end of next week.  We’ve done Ueno Park and the museum Senso-Ji Akhiabara Scramble Crossing Shibuya Harakujen the fish market Team Lab Planets and we’re looking for a few different things to do with our 14 year old. We’d like to go up one of the towers and he’s keen to see the imperial palace ( if we can figure out how we book!) any other suggestions please? We looked at the snow monkeys but a bit of a challenging journey for a day. Also looked at Hakone and Nikko but seems quite expensive. If we would be missing out massively by not doing one of these or another day trip then we’d be up for it! We’re also going to Kyoto Sapporo and Hiroshima. Thanks so much! ,bruisyard,Tokyo,United Kingdom

I arrive in Tokyo on Friday and have sixteen days in Japan.  Should I bring cash Australian dollars and change it when I am there? And if so where is it best to change money.  Alternatively should I put money on my Wise travel card and use that card and/or my Visa card at ATM's?  I will probably change some cash at the airport on arrival to get me through the first day. ,GeeBee053,Tokyo,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hey all we are booked to spend 2 nights in Okinawa arrive at 9 am so making the most of the day.    Planning to spend the first night in Chatan and the 2nd in Naha near the port as it seems there will be traffic Monday morning to get to the airport. Was going to get a ferry over to the Kerema island and looked at availability to do a DIY trip. Seems there is only one trip I found from Chatan that I found.    I've looked at tide times so it is likely we will see turtles but even tours don't guarantee it. Looks like it will be tricky with times any suggestions or alternatives? As it looks like we don't need a tour and can use the ferries and bus to get around the islands or walk as they come close to the shore. Looked at whale sharks but then sadly read they are captive unless this has changed. ,CHOCABLOC,,"London, United..."
Hi all    I'm planning to take a morning Shinkansen bullet train from Tokyo to Kobe (which will take approx 3 hours). I then hope to stretch my legs and spend a couple of hours or so in Kobe before catching the bus onward to Tokushima (Shikoku Island) from (I think) Kobe ANA Crown Plaza bus stop.    I don't plan to do much in Tokushima on arrival besides check-in and get settled so I could theoretically spend a little longer in Kobe if there were any must-dos!    I will also return back through Kobe at a later date but this time will be heading to Osaka which will give me another opportunity to see some of Kobe. Any suggestions are much appreciated. ,Ksara1865,Kobe,United Kingdom

Hello Experts    We are traveling from Takayama to Kyoto in the afternoon in November. A direct bus is 4.5 hrs long. A couple of trains take 3.5 hours long. Price is not a factor. Which option has better experience (sights sounds and exposure different peoples) in this geographic area in November in the afternoon?    Thanks for your advice ,Jagadeesh,,
Advice please on where to go.    I love Kyoto and in past visits I was happiest just wandering around. However this time I have unfortunately injured my foot and hobbling around in pain is not fun.    It occurred to me that I could make more use of my JR pass to enjoy the view from the train (I love train journeys).    What I need is maximum travelling minimum walking.    Any suggestions where there would be something preferably close to the station (or linked by a direct local bus) that I could visit for a couple of hours before returning?    I would like to spend more time on the train than on the ground but I could probably manage a stroll round a garden (another of my loves)    I don't mind which direction I go but wondered about heading further south.      FYI: On previous visits I've been to Nara Kobe Osaka Himeji Tokyo area ... this time I went down to the Nachi Falls and also visited Mikimoto Pearl Island so I have seen a lot of the beautiful scenery in that direction.    I am also going to have a day out in Kanazawa primarily visiting the Kenrokuen Garden.    Thanks! ,Pamela J L,Kyoto,Zichron Yaakov...
I am travelling from okayama to Kyoto Wwith an overnight on the way in Osala to go to Universal studios.  Any suggestions on where to stay that is mid range near Universal.

Hi guys    Are the Goyard items still low in stock?    If you could only choose to go to 1 Goyard shop would you go to the one at Isetan Shinjuku or Takashimaya Nihombashi? Does anyone have any experience shopping there?    Thank you ,Pandapopop,Tokyo,
Hi everyone    We loved our time in Japan earlier this year and are keen to return. We are a family of four and our kids will be 9 and 11.    Even though it’s a long way away we are already dreaming of our second trip. We can visit this time next year - late October 2024 - for 7 nights (and could stretch to 9).    During our first visit we were lucky to have 3.5 weeks and we visited Tokyo Kanazawa Kyoto Nara Hiroshima and Miyajima. In Tokyo we visited Asakusa Akihabara Ginza Tokyo Tower Shibuya Harajuku Nezu and Yanaka. We also went to Team Labs and Disney Sea.    For this second trip we are thinking that we will focus on Tokyo with just a couple of day trips to keep the amount of travelling down and costs low. There are some places in Tokyo we’d like to revisit but we also want to see new areas too.    So here is our rough plan. We will probably book accommodation in Asakusa.    Day 1 Arrive  Day 2 Asakusa and Kuramoe  Day 3 Yokohama  Day 4 Nezu Yanaka Rikugien  Day 5 Shimokitazawa and Shinjuku  Day 6 Akihabara Tokyo tower and Ginza (pm)  Day 7 Nikko  Day 8  Day 9  Day 10 Depart    We would love some input into other areas in Tokyo to see or things to do please to decide whether to stretch to 9 nights. Where would you suggest?    We enjoy parks and gardens short hikes with good views architecture design and crafts food and markets (but we are vegetarian so not the fish market) and computer games and anime. We enjoy visiting some temples (the kids generally tolerate a few but inevitably say no more after a while).    Is it a good idea to stay overnight in Nikko? Is this helpful to get an early start and beat the Autumn crowds? An overnight trip would give us time to visit Edo wonderland but we can’t work out if this place is worth visiting or just a tourist gimmick. An overnight stay would add costs for accommodation.    Thanks in advance for any advice :-) ,Wild Rumpus Travel,,"Sheffield, United..."
Can someone recommend a nice hotel to stay at very close to Haneda airport.    Easy access to International Terminal 3 and also to the Metro for a day trip.    Thanks ,Matt S,Tokyo,Greater Sydney...
Hi I read that although there is an underground passage connecting the 2 stations it is quite confusing and better to walk above ground. May I ask which is the best way coming from Haneda with luggage? Which exit from Toei Asakusa has an elevator and is closest to Tobu Asakusa? Thank you. ,Goldenbear1980,Tokyo,Bukit Fraser...

Hello Narita Visitors    We are visiting from USA and I understand that I need to withdraw cash from an ATM in Narita airport and buy Welcome Suica card before I can use any trains to Tokyo.

Hi all    A little bit confused about the bus stop from Kanazawa to Shirakawago area.Supposed I want to have a stop at Gokayamacan I have a stop at Gokayama on the return trip to Kanazawa from Takayama or Shirakawago?    Or should I stop first at Gokayama before Shirakawago?I am confused whether it is only allowed for boarding only at Gokayama.    Am I correct to make trip plan like this: Kanazawa-Shirakawa go-Takayama-Gokayama-Kanazawa?    Thanks a lot. ,Henny L,,
We have 7-8 days between Nikko and Hokkaido in May. After that we will meet up with our children in Osaka.

Hi all!  I am an early 30yo female from Australia heading to Japan solo in May 2024. I am married with young kids but this has been a bucket list for me for a long time so have decided to take the plunge and do it alone. I love Japanese food (being solo happy for more casual eating/street food) and like to walk around wherever I can - I would prefer to walk than change trains where possible. I don't have any particular interest in anime or subcultures but looking for the quintessential Japanese first trip. After Tokyo I am heading to Matsumoto walking Tsumago - Magome and then have 4 nights in Kyoto. As I can't be away from my family too long (and hope to come back to Japan) I only have 2 nights in Tokyo (arrive 6:45am into Haneda Day 1 and leave for Matsumoto 9/10am on Day 3).    Day 1 (Fri 24th May) - Arrive Haneda 6:45am  - Clear customs etc arrange bag to be delivered same day to hotel  - Keikyū Airport Line to Hagishi-Ginza walk to Tsukuji outer market for breakfast  - Asakusa Line from Hagishi-Ginza to Asakusa Station (maybe visit Hamarikyu Gardens first in which case alight at Shimbashi Station)  - Walk Asakusa Station to Senso-ji then on to Ameyoko Shopping District via Kappabashi St (and maybe Ueno park?)  - Explore Ameyoko Shopping District and walk down to Akihabara area to explore.  - Take train from Iwamotocho Station to Shinjuku-sanchome Station check in to Tokyu Stay Shinjuku (available from 3pm)  - Relax in room and then do Shinjuku free walking night tour (Tokyo Localized) in the evening (or sumo tournament)  Day 2 (Saturday 25th May)  - Head to Meiji Shrine/Yoyogi Park from Tokyu Stay Shinjuku (Fukutoshin Line from Shinjuku-sanchome Station to Meiji-jingumae ‘Harajuku’ Sta).  - Explore Harajuku Ometesando Aoyama Farmers Market Shibuya  - Sumo tournament (I aim to get a ticket when they go on sale!) - or Friday see q6 below.  Day 3  - Train to Matsumoto    Questions -  1. Does anyone know the cost for same day Yamato delivery from Haneda to Shinjuku hotel? I can't seem to work it out from the website.  2. Will the Asakusa Line be busy for morning peak hour to Asakusa and if so what is the best time to travel to avoid this? I don't want to get to Senso-ji too late but also don't want to be suffocated on the train :)  3. Are there any attractions in Ueno Park that are a must see (museums or sights?). Is it nice to walk through just because?  4. Is the street food around Ameyoko shopping district worth eating or if not any recommendations between Ueno and Akihabara? I'm not interested in maid or animal cafes.  5. Is the Aoyama Farmers Market worth visiting?  6. Day 2 I am a little unsure how to work it all out. Is it feasible to do everything by say 3/4pm so I can get back to my hotel and then to the sumo tournament from about 4:30pm? If not any suggestions on a better way of arranging this (could possibly move the sumo wrestling to the Friday instead?)  7. I am assuming I don't have to book my ticket to Matsumoto in advance? Any suggestions for morning activity before I head off?  8. I'm not really seeing much of Shinjuku other than the night walking trip which takes in all the bar areas. Is there anything else I should definitely see here? (may head to the Govt Building if I have time but not overly fussed if I miss it).  9. Any other thoughts/ideas/suggestions? ,keedm002,Tokyo,"Adelaide, Australia"

Hi can I have some advice on an easy route to Kyoto station I don't have JR pass.    Using the Tokaido-Sanyo Line came as the first option on hyperdia cheapest and fastest but i read from old posts that its a crowded line we'll be departing at 9am.    Which route has a less complicated and easy transfer I've kids pram and 1 medium luggage with us. Should I take the Shinkansen Nozomi Exp instead?

I am travelling around Japan on a cruise and Toyama is one of numerous ports. I am going through all the excursions offered by the ship for the various ports of call. They are very expensive so I am being very selective with choices. Many of the tours make a “feature” of including free time or shopping time which I think is a bit of a joke when you are paying a fortune for something that costs them nothing.    The idea of this post is to see places where it is worth exploring on foot around the port area or travel by local transport to places of interest. I prefer this than being part of a large group. Knowing Japan is very punctual with public transport means I can hopefully assure I will be back onboard in time for departure. My only concern will be conversing in English as I don’t speak Japanese. I will endeavour to learn a few phrases before I go.    Other options would be to arrange a local private tour and get some other passengers to share the cost. It would be much nicer travelling with a small group rather than a bus load. It would be great if you have any recommendations.    My husband and I are both 70 and reasonably active so walks are fine. Not strenuous treks or ground being too rocky or rough. I know a cruise isn’t necessarily the best way to see Japan but as a first time visit it will be a lovely way to check it out.    Any suggestions would be most appreciated.    Thanks.

We have a trip planned in December this year. We are travelling from Tokyo to Hiroshima then widning our way back through okayama osaka and kyoto. Before gettign back to Tokyo we want to go to Hakone and/or Lake Kawaguchiko. The main aim is to get to see Mt Fuji and surrounds. I know you can do daytrips from Tokyo I dont want to do that so we increase our chances of seeing the Mt and also experience nature.

We will be in Niseko 12/29 to 1/1. There are 11 in our family ranging in age from 9 to 72. After we check out from our condo in Niseko on 1/1 we will have one day before our international flight departure from Haneda Airport. We're trying to decide whether to spend our last day on 1/1 in Sapporo or take the train back to Tokyo. At this point would have spent 4 days in Tokyo on our arrival from 12/22 to 12/26.    Would appreciate any input on this? Trying to figure out where to spend 1/1 and when we travel to Haneda for our international flight. There seems to be flight and train options.

Hello everyone    I am considering booking a flight from Canada to Bangkok that includes a 18+ hour stopover in Tokyo. I'm seeing a flight arriving at Haneda at 4:55 pm and then a flight leaving Narita the next morning at 11:45 am.    Is it reasonable to take a train from Haneda to somewhere central in Tokyo (i.e. Shibuya or some other more accessible/interesting area) find a sleep pod hotel for the night and then take a train to Narita? Or should I be playing it safe and stay in a sleep pod at the airport?    I'm open to ideas - where to go in Tokyo when to go to the airport etc. Or should I be avoiding the idea of going from one airport to another airport like the plague?

I have no idea what the cost for the subway is if you to 2-3 trips a day on the Yamanote line (and potentially others).  I can always use my IC Card for shooping but I want to minimize the need for spending any excess balance on their cards when going back home.  I know I can add money along the way but what is a good sum to start with when arriving to keep them floating for a few days. I really have no idea.... ,joa_bj,Tokyo,"Gavle, Sweden"
Upon my arrival at Haneda T3 I noticed there were two different banks' ATM machines. One was offering me ridiculous transaction charge that went up by the amount. Other ATM machine had a fixed charge which I believe was 200JPY for whatever amount you withdrew. I ended up using the second machine and later found the exchange rate they used was pretty close to the market rate. My US bank charged me $5 fee but overall I think i got an amazing rate. Being in a rush I did not save receipts or noted machine names. My colleague is arriving and i would like to point him to this machine. Does anyone know which of the two banks/ATMs offer best exchange rates? ,1moosafir,Tokyo,Palo Alto...

My partner and I have been in Japan for the past week and up until yesterday we have used Suica on our phones without any issues. However yesterday we were unable to use them successfully on the subway in Kyoto. Mine worked intermittently but my partner’s Suica failed completely. There was plenty of credit on our cards. We were at manned gates and mine was ok after it was read by the machine at the gate but my partner’s didn’t. He ended up buying a ticket from a machine. Can anyone suggest why this may have happened and how to remedy it. Thanks. ,Barbara H,,"Sydney, Australia"
I’ve been reading about Japan’s luggage forwarding service (“takuhaibin” if I got that right) but am concerned it’s too good to be true. All else equal most air passengers prefer to carry on rather than check bags largely because the hassles of toting bags through security and terminals and on and off planes beat the risks and downsides of bags going missing or being delayed. Is takuhaibin reliability qualitatively better than that or airline bag check? ,TiltedFlipCurves,,Bethesda MD
Unfortunately we have time only for two temples in this area of Kyoto. Very difficult to choose. Reviews say people are glad they came specifically here all three have highest ratings.  Kiyomizu dera is going to have night illumination in November Kenninji has amazing paintings and zen garden Yasaka is Gion Shinto shrine.  Please help to choose two out of three.  We are visiting in November and in other two days in Kyoto we are going to visit more temples and shrines Buddhist and Shinto but different parts of the city.

I did some research on buying my train tickets. My first choice is the observation deck seats on the 7000. They book up immediately. They go on sale a month beforehand at 10 am Japan time. 6pm California time the day before. Then I thought it was 30 days beforehand but I did some playing around on the site and it’s a month not 30 days. Anyways has anyone sat in the back of the observation deck? I’d prefer the front. (That gets booked up first). Is it weird looking back not forward? Also there’s only 2 morning 7000 trains. 7:37 am and 11:20. 11:20 is too late for me. I was hoping for somewhere around 8:30. (I wanted breakfast at my hotel in Tokyo before I left). The 8:31 train is listed as Hakone 5 exe 10. Does anyone know what train that is? There’s one at 8:11 also which is Hakone 3 exe 10. I’d prefer a newer train with larger windows even if they’re just side views.  I’m pretty sure I can get back observation deck if I try right as they go on sale. Any suggestions or experiences? Thanks I did see the train descriptions on their site. I just don’t know what train is what when trying to book. ,Lisa W,Hakone-machi,Huntington Beach CA

We are staying in Shinjuki and looking to travel around the city of course  Also want to visit Sendai for more cherry blossom experiences (day trip)  Kyoto also appeals to visit for the day  Mount Fuji potentially if I don't book a day tour of some description.    Which card to get? I know about the JR pass but the price rises seem to put a lot of people off. A YouTuber raved about the Suico card - it seems to be a good fit.    Guessing whichever card is the best can be picked up from the airport and loaded up? We are arriving at Narita International.    One experience we want is a ride on a bullet train. Two destinations recommended are Nagano and Kyoto.    So is there one card to suit them all?    ***Bullet train experience***  We want to try the bullet train - a YouTuber mentioned the grand class experience to Nagano - does this experience exist on all bullet trains - say out to Kyoto?    Is Nagano worth visiting - its a shorter trip via bullet so does appeal.    Can anyone provide a link to be able to learn more and book a bullet train ride as apparently they sell out quite quickly.    ***SIM card***  We are coming from Taiwan so ideally would love a SIM card that covers both countries. The brief research I looked at made it look like SIM card data allowances were relatively small - 12 gig or so? Not sure that will be enough for Taiwan/Tokyo combined (two weeks) - doing a lot of uploading of our daily adventures so not sure.    Again apologies for the basic questions. Thank you in advance for any advice you can provide. ,Trevor G,Tokyo,"Brisbane, Australia"
We are a group of 4 Australians who are planning to have a few days touring in the Gifu region. We were considering basing ourselves in Takayama and visiting a couple of places like Kanawaza and Shirakawago in mid March after staying in Tokyo. I have been reading the forums and it seems that the road conditions may still be icy. As we have never experienced driving in snowy/ icy conditions should we abandon our original idea of renting a car and use trains and buses? Driving independently is our preference but we wouldn't risk driving in conditions we're not used to. ,Jan T,Takayama,
Travelling in November want to book Tokyo to Osaka Shinkansen Green car with luggage. Website says tickets not available yet but can pay & receive confirmation when available.    Trying to do this before price increase. Is this the right way or with Klook will we not be able to select seats a month before travel? Want seats C & D to hopefully see Mt Fuji. ,esptm,Tokyo,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi both me and my husband will be traveling to Kyushu this Dec 4-17 after reading through the itinerary shared on blogs and tripadvisor forum and considering winter seasons we are really unsure to drive or rail. Our itinerary is as follows:  1. Arrive in Fukuoka. Will stay to explore the city for 3 days. Am thinking of renting a car when we leave for Nagasaki  2. Explore Nagasaki for 3 days and travel by ferry to Kumamoto.  3. Then to Kagoshima Takachiho Gorge Mt Aso and Beppu before going back to Fukuoka.    What we are worried is driving in snow which my husband has no experience in. But JR pass has limited days for us to enjoy the island. Also Kagoshima is quite far from Fukuoka should be give it a miss?    Please advise Thanks. ,Dove B,Kyushu,"Singapore, Singapore"
Has anyone visited this castle in Beppu using public transportation? Google doesn't show me the whole way. I will be sightseeing on foot and only have one day in Beppu. My priorities will be the hells and a spring bath. If possible I would like to add Kifune castle. But it's not looking like it's possible without a car. ,Sara R,Beppu,Coral Gables...

Hi I'm gearing up to soon buy some entry tickets plus a particular express pass (probably one of the less popular ones as we're avoiding scary rides).  I've worked out how to do so and navigated the USJ official website so hopefully on the day when I'm able to buy the tickets and passes it will be relatively straight forward fingers crossed and I don't have to revert to buying them on Klook.  Are there any know difficulties in buying through the official website as a foreigner outside Japan and using a mastercard to pay?  Thanks! ,Renee1901,Osaka,

Hi we are family of 4 with 2 young children. We’ll be in Japan for 2 weeks in April 2024 arriving in KIX and leaving from NRT. So far we plan to spend 5 nights in Kyoto/ Osaka 2 nights in Hakone and 4 nights in Tokyo. This will be our second visit to Japan but first time with kids and I am not sure how to start planning as it will be hard to stick with a set itinerary.  We really enjoyed Kyoto last time we visited and would like to stay there this time (we stayed in Osaka last time). I’m thinking we’ll be spending 3 days to explore Kyoto 1 day to visit Nara and another days to visit Kobe or Osaka. I understand there is not much to do in Kyoto at night and we are okay with that. However I just want to check in here first to see if I am missing something. Is Kyoto kid friendly? Are there enough activities to entertain young kids? We’ll be bringing strollers and carriers. Thank you ,Dog_lover444ever,Kyoto,Los Alamitos...

Hi I’m looking for a hotel in Ginza Shinjuku or Shinuya (based on forum posts that these are walkable areas near train stations) for around 30000 yen per room. We’re a family of 5 (three generations; all adults) visiting Tokyo in early Dec. for the first time. We’re staying for only a few nights and likely need to book two rooms to accommodate all of us.

We are flying into and out of Tokyo the middle to end of March. I was thinking of getting a Japan Rail Pass and doing Tokyo 2 (days) Hakone (ryokan there) (2 days) Kyoto 5 days with day trips to Nara and Osaka then take a train back towards Tokyo maybe Kanezawa (2 days) and then Tokyo again for 2 days. Is that a reasonable trip. Any advice would be truly appreciated ,Fvill2,,"San Antonio, Texas"
I will ask my Kyoto hotel to forward my luggage to my Tokyo hotel but I won't arrive at the Tokyo one until 2 days later.    Apparently my Tokyo hotel charges 1000 yen for luggage storage before check-in / after check-out which is rare.    When I forward my luggage from Kyoto is there an option to select what day it should arrive? So I can avoid having to pay 2 days of storage and just pay 1.    Thanks ,Steptoad,,United Kingdom

We have a free day in Tokyo and thinking of taking the bullet train to Kamakura. We are staying at the Hilton Tokyo.  Questions:  1. How much does it cost round trip for a reserved seat?  2. Do we need a guide once we get there instead of getting a guide to accompany us from Tokyo?  3. Can we walk the entire area?  4. Can we manage in English?    Thanks ,PhylCo,Tokyo,Bermuda Dunes...
Hello    I'm trying to hit the famous street food places in Osaka in one day. While the best place in the morning is Kuromon Ichiba Market its proximity to Dotonbori (for afternoon) makes it unsuitable for us. Would be Shinsekai good in the morning? On Street View it looks kinda deserted :-) We will be there on Saturday around 9 am.    Thank you for your suggestions. ,mikiqex,Osaka,"Prague, Czech..."
Been travelling a lot to different parts of the world including bigger cities in Asia Europe and the US. But Tokyo makes me feel so unprepared....  This post addresses what I should book/prepare in advance and I would like to get some advice if it is needed and by how many days/weeks. Or if it just more of hop-on/walk-in for some of them.  - Keisei Skyliner from Narita to Ueno  - The Nozomi from Tokyo to Osaka (and the opposite direction)  - Disney Sea (admission as well as Fast pass).

(admission as well as Fast pass).  - Pokemon Cafe  - Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation  - teamLab Planets    That is all I can think of right now. Tried to find some recent advice but most of them have mostly dated information in various travel blogs web-sites and here.

Hi  We have 12hrs in Tokyo on our way to Australia in December (10am-10pm depart). We arrive/ depart Haneda - is it easy to get into the city? Where would you suggest we head with our teenagers- they are very excited and we want to take them to some places with the wow factor/ Instagram worthy!  Is it easy to navigate around or would a half day tour be better? Just concerned it will be so overwhelming that we won't end up anywhere and miss the best places to go! I really want to see the Sensoji Temple but will this be hard to get to/ away from the main area for the kids as we have such little time?  Also on our return journey we have one evening layover (8pm arrival and 10.30am departure) - is that too little to stay in the city or shall we just stay close to airport?  Any help massively appreciated! ,KylaandMicky,Tokyo,George Green...
This winter we are planning a round trip in Japan. After visiting Tokyo and Kanazawa we plan tot go southwards to Fukuoka after which we will visit Hiroshima / Miyajima Naoshima Kyoto Kobe (where our daughter studies) and Osaka. We have two days to travel from Kanazawa tot Fukuoka by public transport. What place do you recommend to visit along the way other than the places already mentioned? Or is there a maybe slower but scenic train ride to bridge the long distance pleasantly? Thank you! ,K J,,
If you happen to be in Kanazawa and have the time to rent a car to drive the White Road from Shirikawa-go through Hakusan National Park (or vice versa like we did) do it!    I did not have this on the itinerary but we rented a car to explore the Hakusan NP and due to the rain ended up taking this scenic route and it was amazing. Some more detail below and for pictures I refer you to my Instagram profile (user: scratchingtheworld). For all costs mentioned in EUR the current exchange rate is around JPY 157/EUR.    We rented our car for 24h from TOYOTA Rent a Car Kanazawa Station West Exit and paid JPY 9801 with full coverage. There's many other rental agencies around and prices seemed quite similar but we were really happy with the service provided here.    The next morning we set off to the National Park from Nomi a village just outside of Kanazawa where we were staying. We first drove to Ichinose Visitor Centre with some great views along the way and did a small hike there to a viewing platform but it was raining cats and dogs so we quickly decided to revert to driving rather than walking. For avid walkers though the park seemed beautiful and there are plenty of mountain hikes (with overnight stay) to do.    We drove to the start of the White Road on the west side of the park and stopped for lunch at roadside Station Station Sena where there were several restaurants. We ate at the udon place there (https://maps.app.goo.gl/888aGXP2D9JihALa6) which hands down had the best noodles we had in Japan so far. Pretty sure all of them contain offal so if this is not your thing be mindful. We had the yam version and the spicy one (level 3 out of 9 which was already very spicy) and both were really good. We finished with a coffee and ice cream at Yamaneko Kijitora Coffee Roastery next door also reommended and then started our drive through the park.    After a few minutes drive you will come at the toll gate where you need to pay JPY 1700 for a regular vehicle and then the road is yours. As the weather was genuinly awful there were not a lot of other people driving around which allowed us to stop the car and take pictures from inside and there are plenty of spots where you want to do this. After every bend there is an amazing view waterfalls mountain tops... There are plenty of parkings foreseen at points of interest so you can safely park and take it all in. There are also places where you can go for a hike to for example a waterfall or hotspring that is a bit further out but the rain and lack of time stopped us from doing that. I am fairly confident that on a sunny day you can make this an all-day excursion if you want to visit some of these spots.    Along the road we also ran into a few monkey groups that were going about their day on the roadside. They were clearly not as confident around people as the ones in the Snow Monkey Park in Shibu Onsen so try not to alert them and keep your distance but it is fun to see them out in the wild. One place we saw many was Saruko Bridge but I'm not sure they are always there of course.    Unfortunately once we passed to the Gifu prefecture side of the road the clouds were too much and we did not really see anything more but by then we more than had our share of amazing sights. I can imagine this road is gorgeous any time of year but now with the autumn colors it was particularly beautiful. I do want to mention it was very cold on the mountain top (around 5 degrees versus 18 in Kanazawa) so bring an additional layer maybe.    After passing the exit booth we drove to the Omigachi Castle Observation Deck to have a look at Shirakawa-go but we did not visit the village itself as we were pretty rained out. Driving back to Kanazawa you can drive toll-free which takes around 2h or take a toll road for JPY 1940 which takes a little over an hour (or a middle ground option both in terms of time and costs).    In total we spent a little over 2h on the White Road itself but keep in mind it was cold wet and windy so ni normal conditions you can probably double this. It was easily one of the best things we did on our trip so far so I would highly recommend this to anyone who has the time to do this.    Any questions feel free to ask! ,ScratchingTheWorld,Kanazawa,"Amsterdam, The..."
Planning on taking the Keisei Skyliner from Narita Airport to Ueno station and then a taxi to our hotel in Akihabara. A couple of questions.

I have registered with the Visit Japan Web site and have generated a QR code for immigration and a QR code for customs.  I will not have a smart phone with me when I travel to Narita airport.

Just to confirm that the only nearby available parking lot during winter is Taisho Romankan (about 1.5km from Ginzan Onsen)?    And I read there is a shuttle bus from Taisho Romankan parking lot to Ginzan Onsen. Is this true? Is there any bus timetable for this? ,gabrieltravelling,Yamagata,
Hi all    My husband and I are heading to Japan between 17 Dec to 3 Jan. We aren't getting a JR Pass as it won't be cost effective. Given we are travelling at a time of peak travel by local Japanese folks I'm wondering if we can / should pre-book the following train journeys:  1. Osaka to Kyoto on 26 Dec  2. Kyoto to Kanazawa via JR Thunderbird on 28 Dec  3. Kanazawa to Nagano via Hokuriku-Shinkansen on 30 Dec  4. Nagano to Tokyo Hokuriku-Shinkansen on 31 Dec.    We will have two large bags with us which I understand also need to be pre-booked. I have been searching online for ways to book these tickets. Do they need to be booked with the individual train line companies directly or is there a third-party option that sells train tickets?    Any tips are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance :) ,Siomarsh,,"Frankston, Australia"

If I were to purchase the pass at Ueno Station and travel to Kanazawa on the same day will we be able to get on one of the Shinkansen to Kanazawa? ,LWee,,"Melbourne, Australia"

This is our new first day itinerary:  Day 1: KIX -- Awajishima -- Naruto -- Okuboji  Landing KIX 09:25 on 20 Nov if on time. Take the 11:00 Bay Shuttle high speed ferry (30min) to Kobe Airport and pick up a rental car there and drive to a minshuku next to Okuboji. Hopefully can hit the road by 12:30 and arrive no later than 7pm. Will move on to Shodoshima the next morning after visiting Okuboji.    Hope you could suggest some good spots to break the journey especially places for good scenery and good food. Currently I have a few places in mind like Matsuhonosato Onsen Awaji Hanasajiki Uzu no Oka Onaruto Bridge Memorial Musuem Naruto Park and Ryozenji. Please comment. How would you prioritize if no time to visit all places?    If I got it right we may not be able to see the whirlpool within our time frame. Wonder whether still worth the detour to Naruto Park. BTW where is the best spot to view Onaruto Bridge from Naruto side? There are so many observatories. I also noted the original Michi no eki Uzushio is closed. ,offstone,Shikoku,kuala lumpur

Hi  my family and I are off to Japan very soon and we cant wait. I have been doing a lot of reading and I`m hoping that someone might be able to offer me some information regarding one leg of our trip please. We have purchased JR passes and will be looking to use them to travel when we leave Osaka to go to Hiroshima before heading north again but  checking some travel apps recently  I could only find options for the Nozomi shinkansen leaving Shin-Osaka. When I originally started planning I thought I was able to use either the Hikari or Sakura from Osaka and the JR pass covered that. As I understand it to use the JR pass with the Nozomi or Mizuho I would need to purchase an extra ticket. Could anyone confirm please if the Hikari or Sakura still run from Shin-Osaka or if not what the cost of the extra ticket would be from Osaka to Hiroshima please? I`m happy to purchase them if I need to but would like to factor it in and am I able to buy the extra ticket at the station at the time of travel? TIA  Also ( sorry if this has been asked already :-) ) I have read that SUICA cards are difficult to purchase on arrival in Tokyo. We are landing in Osaka and I would like to be able to purchase IC cards when we land at Kansai if possible. Is there any problem with getting the PASMO or ICOCA cards at Kansai currently. Sorry for the long post. Cheers and again TIA ,Sean W,,"Geelong, Australia"

Hi I am planning a week's stay in either Hamamatsuchodaimo or Odaiba & then another week's roadtrip out to Ibaraki & Nikko (might include Hakone/Mount Fuji but not sure yet).    Someone recommended me to train out to Nikko & rent a car from Nikko though I do not understand how this option would be better off unless renting a car from Nikko is much much cheaper than from Tokyo? It seems so inconvenient to have to lug the luggages onto the Tokyo trains and I have no idea if luggage transfer to Nikko hotels will work + you have to pay for 3 train tickets + luggage transfer. Will the cheaper car rental & tolls savings be much better off than direct car rental from Tokyo?    I was thinking that renting a car directly out from Tokyo with the luggage seems to be more convenient. Renting a car directly from Tokyo would be the most convenient right?    There is a Toyota Rent-A-Car YSKビル 7F 1 Chome-3-11 Shibadaimon Minato City Tokyo 105-0012 Japan & a Times Car Rental next to Grand Nikko Odaiba. ,san20sg,Tokyo,Singapore

Hi everyone    I don’t know what to do or where to go?    I know you have heard this all before but the JR Pass price increase has confused things even more.    We are:  - 40 years old British couple. Just us two!  - This will be our 2nd visit (first visit was April 2014)  - Will hopefully not leave it as long for our 3rd visit (we were even considering visiting in Nov and early/mid Dec this year - so two separate trips).    Dates of travel:  - 2 Nov 2023 - 20 Nov 2023 (from UK). So roughly 2 weeks once flights knocked off    Interests:  - Food drink hiking photography art gardens music sport    Transport:  - Flights not yet booked (from UK). Flights are expensive. Makes little difference where we fly in/out of in terms of cost (i.e. we don’t mind flying into one Japanese airport and out of a different one)  - Cost wise I’m more concerned by travel costs whilst there (would prefer not to have to buy JR pass)  - Car - have driven all over the world and have valid international permit. Only worry is availability of parking.    Language:  - Last time I learned about 100 basic words and phrases and will do so again  - We can’t read kanji other than a few very basic food characters  - Will try our best particularly in pursuit of food and drink!    Budget:  - I’m from Northern England so I’m tight  - Don’t mind ploughing money into food drink and experiences instead of accommodation. Bland business hotels did the job last time.    Previous visit:  - April 2014 - 3 weeks  - Osaka Fukuoka (& Dazaifu & Nagasaki & Gunkanjima) Hiroshima (& Miyajima) Kyoto (& Nara & Koya) Takayama Tokyo (& Fuji).  - Absolutely loved it but…    ‘Mistakes’ last time:  - Chasing Michelin Stars (and often failing to get reservations anyway) rather than realising that it’s almost impossible to eat poorly in Japan  - Being too intimidated to visit Izakaya until late in the trip  - Not discovering Japanese curry until late in the trip  - Going to bed at 3pm on arrival and then waking up at 1am with jet lag that didn’t leave us for over a week…  - …and then staying up all night near the end of the holiday just to go to Tsukiji tuna auction  - Having 5 nights in Tokyo at the end of the trip when we were tired and a little jaded…and then not getting our second wind until the final day    Highlights from last trip:  - Miyajima - oysters deer - great day trip  - Takayama - weather was poor for the 2 days but the food and town were fantastic. Loved the Sake shops  - Kyoto  - Gunkanjima - the only western tourists on the tour. Somehow won both of the raffle prizes on the boat (50/1 chance of 1 win!). Everyone was so happy for us and wouldn’t let us give the prizes away (in hindsight that was presumably a cultural faux-pas to attempt to do so?!)    We don’t have a particular interest in:  - Castles (unless the actual town/city is also worth visiting)  - Onsen. We’re British! My wife and I undress with the lights off so prudish is an understatement. Plus we like to experience things together (apart from undressing or most forms of physical intimacy!!)      Possible options:  - Chugoku/Shikoku - Okayama the art islands (Naoshima etc) Daisen Takamatsu Kibi (hire bikes) Shimanami Kaido (more bikes) Iya (worried about the weather in Nov?) Onomichi Tomonoura…I’d like to go to Hagi too!; or    - South Kyushu (fascinated by Kagoshima); or    - Tohoku / Hokkaido - November probably not the best time      Conclusion:    - I would be grateful for your thoughts. We’re not travelling to Japan in November for the weather but I don’t want to be shivering in the rain for two weeks either    Thanks very much. Any help or advice gratefully received. ,No English Menu,,"Uppermill, United..."

We are a group of 9 family friends traveling to Japan in March. We're thinking of staying in Kyoto for a week and it seems like an Airbnb might be more economical than hotel rooms? I've found a few we're considering and would love any insight or advice those of you familiar with the area might have to share about any of the properties/locations. And if you think a hotel would be better I'd love to know about that too and any suggestions you might have.

We will be arriving to T1 Narita on Wed March 8th @ approx. 12.40pm and we're trying to decide on how best to get to Shimbashi Station.    I know the Skyliner is quicker and more comfortable but that this requires a change at Ueno.    I'm leaning toward taking the Keiser Narita Sky Access which takes longer (and is less glamorous) but goes direct removing the need to drag the luggage when changing.    Looking for advice from anyone who has taken a similar route.    Is the Sky Access that bad? Will we have somewhere to store luggage or need to keep it beside us?    Thanks in advance ,Bryan O,Tokyo,Dublin
Hi I am from UK and going to Japan in November. Does anybody know if Nationwide flex + debit cards or Halifax clarity cards work in 7/11 ATMs. Also is the exchange rate pounds to yen better in this country or Japanese ATMs. I am not sure if I should get yen before I leave UK take lots of pounds in cash to change there or use the ATMs. Hope somebody can advise me. ,Jennie,,"Colchester, United..."

We are a family of four going to USJ on any of the these days (Tue 7th of Nov - Thurs 9th of November).  Have not been able to snatch any of the express passes which are sold out for those dates so even more planning will be required.  This is where I need some help to not make mistakes. In what order to do things is the main questions here where to rush first what to do first etc.  For example if we rush to Nintendo World to get in without a timed pass or get an early pass and spend a couple of hours there the rides we would like to go on the most might be crowded already. Spending two hours for a ride.....will not do it I think.  You get my point I think    Some input first so you get an idea and background.  - Kids are 8 and 11 and do not fancy thrill rides.  - Wife could not care less about Nintendo World. I would not miss it for the world :)  - We plan on being there at least one hour before official opening time have the tickets and app prepared to start working on the app and the timed tickets as soon as we get in.  - The rides we absolutely do not want to miss in order of preference are: 1. Harry Potter. 2. Minion Mayhem 3. Spiderman 4. Mario Cart. Anything more than that is a bonus I think.  I might try to use the single line options for some thrill rides if waiting times are not too long (max 30 minutes which is probably unlikely).    Questions:  - Is a timed ticket to Harry Potter required now? I see conflicting information on this.  - Can you choose your timed entry time slot in the app or are you just assigned one?  I am thinking if we try to get a timed entry to Super Nintendo world the first thing we do but want to start off by rushing to Minion Mayhem or Harry Potter we might completely miss the Nintendo world since we will miss the early slot.  - So in what order to do things to get the best possible change to do the four rides without super long waiting times. And at the same time not miss the Nintendo World.  - Final question. Ride tickets you can book in the app is that only for Wonderland or for any ride in the park (I guess not)  So hit me and help us get the most out of the visit :) ,joa_bj,Osaka,"Gavle, Sweden"

I am arriving at Narita T1 and my hotel is in Ueno near to the JR station. This is an area I have stayed in before.  The obvious choice for airport transfer is the Keisei Skyliner train direct to Ueno Keisei station.  But as I won't be in a hurry I am also thinking about the alternative of taking the limousine bus to T-CAT then make my way to Ueno. I won't have too much luggage.  I think the limousine bus may give me a better viewpoint of the Tokyo area. ,mikem004,Tokyo,"London, United..."

Wanted to buy footwear for the trip. Need advices....    Do we wear snow boots throughout or only at Niseko? How is the ground condition in the places we are going? Sport sports or snow boots? If seniors not going skiing also wear snow boots right? For skiing and snowboard do we wear our own boots on or they have special ones which I should rent?    How cold is it during early Dec?

Hello  We would like to see Fushimi Inari Taisha and Nara. We don't have a lot of time as we have one day in-between leaving our hotel in Kyoto and staying in Osaka for one night. We have a food tour in Osaka at 5pm. Initially my thought was to leave Kyoto - go to Osaka check-in and then take train to Nara and return to Osaka for our 5pm food tour (or send luggage ahead?) However I now see we didn't have Fushimi Inari on our itinerary. There is a possibility we could do Fushimi Inari one evening while in Kyoto. (Staying in Kyoto 3 nights) Although I don't want to have it be too late upon getting back that the restaurants might not be open. This is for early November. What is best option? Is one recommended over the other if not enough time - or both equally important? Thank you. ,travelgreats,Kyoto,Delray Beach...

I have just begun the search but need some help from those of you who have done this in the past.    We need to buy tickets online from both JR West and JR East for our (potential*) November to December trip. I can see that refunds are available but I don't see how to do it if I purchase the tickets online. The site mentions getting the refund from the station or travel agent from whom you purchased the tickets.    Is an online ticket purchase refundable online?    I say potential because we both came down with COVID this weekend and fear we may not feel well by the time we are to depart. And with multiple symptoms and no motivation I'm having trouble searching for the information.    Thanks  hfot2 ,hfot2 🌸🍁🌸,,Vermont

A friend and I are planning on a trip to Japan in February however due to work restrictions we might have to consider March.

We will be staying in Kyoto for six nights in April. We want to include a day trip to Nara plus food tasting in Osaka. The two areas appear to be close. Is it reasonable to do both in a single day or should we spread over two days?  Although we haven't pinned down everything we're planning to do we plan to take a private cooking class explore Kyoto and visit the Gion district.

Hi.    I'll be in Japan for nearly a month and I'd like to see what people think of my itinerary. I've been twice before including places like Mt Fuji Matsumoto Kyoto and Nara.    I'm trying to pack in as much as I can but my main concern is about trying to do too much for the number of daylight hours.    I'd really appreciate anyone's opinions.    Period: Late November - Late December 2023    Day 1: Arrive in Tokyo train to Nagano  Day 2: Nagano overnight in Matsumoto  Togakushi shrine  Day 3: Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route  Days 4+5: Toyama  Mori residence Toyama castle Kurobe Gorge  Days 6+7: Kanazawa (stopping via Takaoka)  Kokozan Zuiryuji temple+Great buddha Oyama shrine Nagamachi Kenrokuen garden  Days 8-10: Fukui  Maruoka castle Eheiji temple Ichijodani village ruins  Days 11-14: Osaka (stopping via Takashima)  Shirahige shrine+Biwako terrace shrines Kobe Osaka castle Bunryaku Museum of Housing & Living Tower of the Sun  Days 15+16: Ise  Ise Shima shrine wedded rocks  Days 17-21: Nagano  Ghibli Park Atusta Jingu shrine Nabano no Sato Nagoya palace day trip to... somewhere  Days 22-25: Tokyo  Ghibli museum TeamLab Planet Sumo practice temples/shrines Parasite museum (because why not?) Taiko performance (if tickets are left)  Day 26: Fly home    A few notes:    * The stopover in Matsumoto is purely to catch the earliest bus from Shinano-Omachi station. The first direct bus from Nagano doesn't get there until 10-something which is quite late when the last bus to Toyama leaves at about 15:30. I want to make sure I don't have to rush.    * I'm planning to take advantage of luggage forwarding in a couple of places like Fukui to Osaka because of the stop in Takashima.    * I plan to use one of the days in both Nagoya and Fukui as rest days (i.e. no plans just eat and relax)    * I'm expecting any trees etc to be mostly leafless and brown by late Nov rather than snowy or colourful. Is that right? I may decide to miss Kurobe gorge if so.    * Day 18 (Nagano) can't be changed as I have something booked. Day 3 is also pretty much locked in because the route closes shortly after.      So. Is the above sane? Please let me know!

Hi. Going to Japan through middle of April next year (hoping to be on lucky side of weather for time of year). I've had some input from people who've visited some areas before and had a bit of a look to see what is in each location worth seeing. We DO want to see as much as we can and have previously done some trips that were quite hectic with multiple and long travel days. So that's not a huge issue really. We're both about 50 and will have backpacks. I'm looking to see if anyone can see any glaring issues with my loose itinerary or has any recommendations regarding journeys/sequence... or perhaps only need 1 night there but you need 2 here etc We fly into and out of Osaka btw. So here is my idea: Osaka 17.15 arrival and days 2&3 Kyoto days 4-6 Himeji day 7 Hiroshima days 8-9 Kanazawa days 10-11 Takayama day 12 Tokyo days 13-15 leaving late on day 15 for Osaka Osaka day 16 - 23.45 departure. Any inputs appreciated. With the new pricing of the JR pass.. any idea if that makes sense for us or are we better off buying individual tickets given our destinations. p.s I also had Okayama and Matsumoto on my not-so-shortlist but ditched them over other options. Thanks. ,KO-DUB,,Newcastle upon...

Hey we are looking gn onsen in Yudunaka for the night travelling from Tokyo to see the snow monkeys and experience a Ryokan and some onsens. I think I have found the official website for Kanaguya but it seems odd that you can't make direct contact and need to go through an agent is that right. We wanted to see if we could visit for the day and looking at costs but not seen that it is possible.    I've also seen a post but it is old saying that you can only use the 9th onsen if not staying in Shibu as the rest are reserved for guests. The 9th onsen is the the private one as far as I know.    My son will not be interested in visiting a million onsens but im looking forward to wearing a yukuta and having dinner and strolling through town after visiting the snow monkeys. So if we can't use the onsens we will just visit for dinner.    We travel next week and will be there early November. It seems like we are travelling in autumn only even visited Japan in spring. Do you think its wise to bring some kind of tough boot and bring a winter coat? O therwise I will use my trainers as I'm only bringing riding boots and a leather jacket. It isn't the start if winter but close enough but it seems fall is delayed so may not be needed. My son only has trainers too. ,CHOCABLOC,,"London, United..."
Would love to visit Japan and if the chance presents itself could go in 2024. However from the brief research I've done into flights so far it's quite expensive.

By that I mean August could be the cheapest month but if it is high risk of typhoons I'd probably prefer to give it a miss. ,poland74,,"Runcorn, United..."
Hey All  Taking my son for a first time from to Japan from USA  We only have 9 days. While primary reason is snowboarding in Niseko.

Unfortunately the Asahi Beer Museum won't be open on the day we planned to visit and do a tour (new year holiday closures) so I'm looking for a suggestion of a similar type of experience to fill one morning that we now have free in Osaka (or otherwise keep it free if my itinerary is looking to busy?).  Here's what I have and where the Asahi tour would have fitted:  Day 1: arrive in Shin-Osaka at 1.30pm (hotel is in Shin-Osaka) Abeno Harukas Midosuji Illumination 6pm dinner reservation  Day 2: day trip to Kinosaki  Day 3: Universal Studios  Day 4: [Asahi Beer Museum Tour] Osaka Aquarium Kuromon Market Dotonbori  Day 5: Kyoto day trip  Day 6: depart Shin-Osaka 9am  This is our 2nd trip to Japan and we've previously visited Kyoto and Himeji plus lots of castles and temples/shrines so I'm probably looking for more of a factory type experience or something else interactive or otherwise appealing to kids/families (14yo and 10yo). We did the cup noodle experience in Yokohama last trip but something similar or along these lines would be great.  Thank you! ,Renee1901,Osaka,

Hi TA Japan experts    I am planning a much-awaited trip with my family - husband 2 kids ( 2 yr and 5 yr) with friends (2 adults and 2 kids - 5 yr and 8 yr) from March 29- April 12 leaving from Texas United States (A long journey I know) - To and fro from Tokyo Narita    Interest- Cherry blossoms of course. One of my friends is an anime figurine shopper so Akihabara is a must. Really want the authentic Ryokan experience with natural onsen outside of Tokyo and Kyoto. I was planning Takayama but it isn't as easy to go there so thinking of Izu peninsula instead.    Additional Information- We will have 4 kids so expecting our pace to be slower than usual (plus jet lag) so want to cherish the places instead of rushing. We do not speak or read Japanese but can find our way using Google translate. :)    Summary: For our 12 full days- I am planning Tokyo (2 days)- Kyoto (5 days)- Izu (2 days) -Tokyo (2.5 days) for the 12 full days we will be there.    I have read many posts on the forums and still need some advice from TA Japan experts  My rough itinerary is as below:    March 29- late evening arrive Narita. Check in Hotel Tokyo  March 30- Tokyo - Shibuya ometesando meiji shrine harajuku (kids will be tired so not planning much this day)  March 31- Tokyo - Ueno park sensoji shinjuku gyoen  April 1 - Leave for Kyoto (JR pass start) Arrive in Kyoto and check in hotel. Evening spend Gion area (depending on time Sanjo-Ohashi bridge yasaka shrine tea ceremony) OR Fushimi Inari >JR Inari station> JR Kyoto Station? Check-in Kyoto  April 2- Kyoto - zen garden nijo castel gekkeikan  April 3- Day trip Nara - Nara park Todai ji sanjo dori street Fushimi inari(?)  April 4- Kyoto- Ginkakuji Kiyomizu dera maruyama park Fushimi inari(?)  April 5- Day trip Osaka - Dotonbori kuromon makrte Himeji Kakoen garden  April 6- Kyoto- Arashiyama kinkakuji river trip from Kameoka or scenic railway  April 7- Kyoto to izu- Overnight Ryokan  April 8 - Izu peninsula- Overnight Ryokan  April 9 - Leave from Izu to Tokyo. Check in Tokyo hotel. Sightseeing.  April 10- Tokyo - Akihabara sega maid café (?)  April 11- Tokyo - sensi-ji mario kart  April 12- check out and leave for flight back Narita    1. Mario Kart- I understand is for adults but is there a a bigger cart that one of the parents drives with kids?  2. Should I do Fushimi Inari during the Nara day trip or during the Ginkauji trip? Or go Fushimi Inari first thing in the morning before heading to Kyoto?  3. What area of Izu peninsula is best to go for Ryokan+onsen experience? We want to spend our afternoon exploring the area as well so some scenic places to visit. Dont want the area too far from Tokyo with easy access to stations. I am so far thinking Kawazu or shizuoka.  4. Ryokan- would appreciate recommendations from you for the areas you recommend. Given we are a group and they charge per person per night don’t want to break the bank. Or should I just stay for 1 night instead given its proximity? So far I have Asaba Shuzenji Shirakabe Shizouka Hokkawa onsen shizouka  Kikuya shizouka.  5. What's the best and reliant way to book Ryokans? Directly or via Ryokancollection?    I will definitely be asking a few more logistical questions once this draft is finalized. Would much much appreciate your input. Super excited for my travel ahead.    Thanks  Dimple ,dimple v,Tokyo,"Dallas, Texas"

Can anyone confirm what dates and times Kenrokuen Garden fall foliage is lit up? I thought it was every day from November 3 through 27 but I saw a brochure online that now leads me to believe it may only happen on Saturday’s from 6:00-8:45pm during that time. I wasn’t sure if the Saturday’s were just special events with light up including concerts or if the only days the garden is lit up is on Saturday night. I was hoping to avoid crowds on a weekend yet would really like to see the light up. If anyone can clarify it is appreciated. ,EnjoyScenicTravel,Kanazawa,Philadelphia...
We have been to Japan many times but never set foot in Shikoku. Somehow I have a strong feeling we are going to love it as much as Hokkaido. It has so much to offer in nature onsen good food and sake history culture and so on. With 2 weeks I hope we can sample it in a more leisurely way enjoying the best it has to offer in this particular season. Hope you can share some tips and help out with the logistics.    To cut down driving time we choose to do a smaller loop Takamatsu-Iya-Kochi-Matsuyama-Tomonoura-Okayama leaving out Naruto whirlpool Shimanto River and Ashizuri for next time in warmer months. We will also use Shinkansen for the first time to travel from KIX to Takamatsu and also from Okayama back to KIX. Please help with the logistic for Haruka Express Sanyo Shinkansen and Marine Liner Rapid tickets.    We can’t find rental car on Shodoshima so will pick up a car from Takamatsu and use the car ferry. Do we have to prebook the Takamatsu-Tonosho roundtrip ferry tickets way in advance? We happen to return on a public holiday. Initially we even consider picking up a car in Okayama and take Ryobi Ferry to Shodoshima on the arrival day. But this may be too tight if there's any flight delay.    According to the koyo forecast the peak time is a bit late this year. Not sure how much this will affect Shikoku but I think most probably we are too late for those in Iya Valley Umpenji Hashikura Temple Yasui Gorge and Nakatsu Gorge. Wonder how the condition in Iya Valley would be when we visit. Still worth staying 3 nights in the region? Befukai and Konose Gorge looks interesting but they are far out of the way.  Currently our itinerary draft is as bellow the number is the date.  Please comment and share your favourite scenic routes and things to see and do at this time of year. Many thanks in advance.    NOV  20. KIX – Takamatsu (pick up rental car Ritsurin)  21. Shodoshima (Kankakei Road of Angel rice fields old olive tree olive park temples-which one? Dō'unzan Mountain?)  22. Shodoshima  23. Takamatsu (Castle Ritsurin night light up kiv Shikoku Village)*public holiday  24. Kotohira (Konpirasan stay Kotohira Onsen)  25. Oboke (kiv Umpenji or Hashikura Temple enroute. Stay Sunriver Oboke)  26. Iya valley (Nigishiiya: Iya Onsen kazurabashi stay Hotel Kazurabashi)  27. Iya valley (Okuiya: Ochiai Nagaro double vine bridge if possible stay Kazuraya)  28. Kochi (Sugi no osugi Castle Makino Botanical Garden Chikurinji cosmos field Ekin Museum Hirome market Katsurahama)  29. Kochi  30.

Hi everyone    I will be staying in Kagoshima for two days at the very end of November. I wanted to go for a half day trip to Tarumizu Senbon Ginkgo. As I am not driving and there is no public transport I am really worried how difficult it is to reach and leave Tarumi Senbon Ginkgo by taxi from/to Tarumizu Port.    If anyone is familiar with that area your information will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much! ,Lucaso,Kagoshima,
We intend to stay for 2 nights in Magome and hike to Tsumago on our full day. We intend to take the bus back from Tsumago to Magome but just thinking about contingency options in case we are too late to leave (the last bus leaves at 4pm+ according to google). In a pinch is it possible to call a taxi from Tsumago at 5pm/6pm? Or are we stuck doing an emergency overnight? ,Elliannia,Gifu Prefecture,
We will be arriving in late March and we intend to rent a car (probably with a Central Nippon Expressway pass from Toyota Takayama) and drive from Takayama to the onsen town in Okuhida and then to Nagano. Then we intend to visit the Nakasendo before returning the car in Takayama.    I'm a bit concerned about the driving conditions on the Takayama - Okuhida - Nagano route. I know it is a mountainous region will there still be a lot of snow/ice on the roads in late March? Will cars hired in Takayama come with winter tyres or do we have to ask for it?    Also any issues with our plan that I might not have thought of? We are fairly familiar with alpine driving having lived in NZ for several years and we are also familiar with left-side driving. We intend to take it slow and drive carefully of course. ,Elliannia,Gifu Prefecture,

Leaving for Tokyo and Osaka in about a week.  Coming from Scandinavia with two kids joining the trip food will be something in focus. For good and bad (seen from my perspective).    What I am looking for are the types of restaurants we typically do not have here which would make the kids surprised amazed and interested.  Sushi conveyer belt restaurant is of course a must and I know they will love it (perhaps not all the food though)  Focus is not necessarily related to the food itself but more the experience around it.    I have traveled expensively in Asia and especially in China but never in Japan so I will be a bit harder to surprise or impress but as focus in on the kids I will not look for things for myself that much.    So hit me. Anything from types of categories to specific restaurants. We are based in Akihabara but will going around to different places mainly around the Yamanote line ,joa_bj,Tokyo,"Gavle, Sweden"
Hello  We will be traveling from Tokyo to Kyoto on November 23rd. We are a family of 4. I see that there are several trains per hour. Is it necessary to book our Shinkansen tickets ahead of time (now)? Or is it okay to wait until we arrive at the station? Is there a pro or con to either of these? We just want to make sure we have seats. We would probably depart between 10:00-11:00am. Thank you!!!! ,Maria P,,"Pasadena, California"
This information is for Indian and other passport holders that are required to have a shore pass or transit visa to step out of Haneda Airport.    If you have overnight layover at Haneda and wish to go outside to city or hotel and if you have Indian passport once you arrive at Tokyo Haneda you will be guided to a booth near immigration desk and issued a Shore Pass. No prep is necessary. They did not ask me any paperwork for hotel expenses etc. It was like a snap and normal routine. I was out of terminal in less than 30 minutes after deplaning. I rate them 5/5 stars.    The amount of misinformation spread by JAL USA and Japan Embassy Los Angeles is mind-boggling. Japan Embassy gave me clear instructions Cancel your flight and make other arrangements. JAL USA advised me to speak with Japan Border Control office in Tokyo. JAL India instead asked me to go ahead and not to worry about anything.    There is a website here https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/ which is confusing as it is. I was able to generate a QR code for customs but the QR code did not work at the airport. Which again was not the issue as the gentleman sitting at desk helped me promptly.    what a trip and lack of coordination. ,IMDucatista,,so california

I recently learned that the Kenrokuen Garden Light up is primarily only on weekends (excepting days between holidays). I can be there early in the day (prior to opening) and stay in town until the evening yet am seeking opinions on whether this is the best use of time. Is Kenroukuen Garden worth seeing in the fall for light up? I can go on the 11th or 18th of November (both days require at bit of travel to arrange) - is one recommended over the other? I’m spending 4 days in Kyoto as well as visiting Ritsurin and Korakuen Garden near/in Okayama.

I would really like to see the fall foliage at Korankei. I’m looking at Nov. 13. I plan to go early yet would also like to see the night lighting however I’m very concerned with my ability to get back to Nagoya (or potentially Kyoto). Is there any way to reserve a bus? I assume with all of the visitors that it may be very difficult to get on a bus to return to Nagoya. If I have to queue up far in advance it may not be worth going as I may miss the light up. Also how delayed are the busses on a return trip? I was hoping to leave on the Meitetsu Bus at 7:41pm but don’t think it is reservable. Just trying to determine if there is a feasible way to accomplish visiting without stressing about getting back and not stranded. Any advice is appreciated. ,EnjoyScenicTravel,Nagoya,Philadelphia...

Hi all    I am planning a solo trip to Japan in May '24. I enjoy walking as a way of immersing in an area and was interested in the Kyoto Trail Higashiyama Route particularly from Fushimi Inari to Chion-in or thereabouts. Has anyone walked this trail before? If so is it recommended and any comments on how easy to follow/difficult/busy it is and any parts that are a must-see? I can't work it out from the information but I think that section is around 9km (please let me know if this is way off!). I would be looking at most likely Sunday 26 May.

Hi I will appreciate any comments on the below itinerary & recommend a very nice hotel in Tokyo under 30k yen/night. I was previously looking at Asakusa Tobu Hotel because it would be very close to the train to visit Nikko but now I have confirmed I would be driving instead for convenience so I need not stick to Asakusa region.    As I will be having 4 days around Odaiba/Disney area for Disneyland Disneysea Mirakan Teamlab Tokyo Kidzania etc I was wondering if I should stay around Ginza area instead. Can you recommend a nice but affordable hotel under 30K yen per night that is near metro to access easily Disneyland/Odaiba & Harajuku/Asakusa as well.    Can you also recommend any nice and quirky hotel/onsen/ryokan in Ibaraki & Nikko or maybe Hakone with great views and preferably under 30k yen?

First let me say thank you to the TA community (especially the Tokyo DEs) for all of the helpful advice that helped me plan this trip. I hope the detailed trip report can help others plan their ideal Japan vacation!    Friday - June 30:  I should have been asleep getting some rest for my scheduled 6am flight from Cincinnati to Detroit but it was nearly 12:30 and I was just finishing up a few last minute things when the dreaded notification from Delta hit my phone... Flight delayed - missed connection alert. Let me pause here to say that I purposefully booked a 6am flight (the first flight of the day and a 4 hour layover in DTW in anticipation of a busy travel week and to help smooth out any travel snafus. So much for the best laid plans. I called Delta and was able to arrange another flight through MSP that would get me into Haneda just 30 minutes after my original flight. Crisis averted (for now).    I got only a few hours sleep but I figured I'd just sleep on the plane. No issues driving to the airport. Cincinnati (CVG) was busier than normal. I have TSA precheck and I'm medallion with Delta so it was easy for me to drop my bag and clear TSA but the airport was busy ... I was on my way to the concourse when I got another flight delay notification from Delta. Now I was going to miss my connection in MSP. I called Delta and the best they could do was to have me take a later flight from MSP that would get me to HND nearly 6 hours later than planned. I was furious that they had fumbled the ball twice now.    I flew to MSP and waited more than 7 hours for my flight to HND - having missed the connection by mere minutes. I knew that July 4th was gonna be a tough weekend for travel but this was ridiculous given that no weather issues had caused these delays. The Delta SkyClub in MSP is brand new and nice but nowhere I want to spend 7 hours.    Finally time to board my flight to HND - delayed yet again - just for 30 min. this time though (ha!). At this point I was happy to just get in the air knowing that my first day in Tokyo was shot but that my climb of Fuji would be able to proceed as planned.    I flew Delta Premium Select and the seats are nice. More comfortable seat more room more recline bigger tv and better food. They give you some amenities but nothing you'd really wanna keep. It was worth it for the loooong flight to HND. I was exhausted after such a frustrating day and did my best to sleep as much as possible on the flight to help get me on Japan time. We landed ontime at 6:15pm (after that last 30 min delay).    Off the plane and I hurried to customs and immigration. My experience here was a pleasant surprise. I had registered on Japan Web so I was ready to go with my QR codes and I was at the front of the line of folks coming from my plane. There was a bit of a line in front of me but it never stopped moving. From the time I entered the immigration line it took me only 13 minutes to clear passport control grab my bag and clear customs. 13 minutes! It was exceptionally well organized and smooth. Delta could take a page out of this book...    I had saved so much time at HND I decided to try and rush to meet my friend at Meiji Jingu stadium for the Yakult Swallows game that I was missing. I texted him when I cleared customs and he said it was the top of the 3rd. I should have gotten some cash and coins a HND when I had the chance but I was consumed with trying to catch some of the game.    I had preloaded a SUICA card on my iPhone wallet and so I headed straight for the train hoping that I would be able to drop my bags in a locker at the station near the stadium. I got turned around making a transfer at a station - I'm gonna chalk that up to frazzled nerves because the subway system is very easy to use. But that did cost me some precious time.    I finally get to my final destination and of course all of the large lockers that would fit my bag at the station were taken. I dragged my bags to the stadium and found lockers there but they only accepted coins. So then I had to go find an ATM. The closest ATM didn't accept American cards. Had to talk .5 mile to a 7/11 where I got cash but even when I bought some food they didn't want to make change for me. I went back to the stadium and thank goodness somebody there took pity on me and made some change for me so I could finally get a locker. Moral of the story: get some cash (and coin) at HND. With my bags stored my buddy came out with my ticket and we were able to see the last 2.5 innings where the mighty Swallows beat the Hiroshima Carp. Interestingly enough the Carp uniforms and logo look suspiciously like the Cincinnati Reds...    The food at the stadium was pretty good. At least the stuff that I tried! I was so glad to have been able to see some of the game. The atmosphere of a Japanese baseball game is very fun. I gotta hand it to those Carp fans - they don't quit! We hit their team store after the game then I collected my bags and we walked to our hotel - the Prince Gallery.    The Prince Gallery is fantastic in almost every way. I'm platinum with Marriott and while I did get a room upgrade I didn't get access to the club lounge. They did throw in free breakfast though at the hotel restaurant. Our room had an amazing view of the Tokyo Tower and Mt Fuji - as we found out the next morning!    It had been a long day; after we got settled in it was straight to bed. ,Les M,Tokyo,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
Hi all I've searched the Japan forum boards for this info. Some of it is old info and would like current info.

I am going to take the romance car from Shinjuku to Odawara on a weekday. I’m looking at the time table now & boy am I confused! If I’m understanding it correctly if I want to take the train that has the observation deck (red logo on time table) I need to take the 7:27 am train? If I want early morning. The next train is 11:20 correct? My plan is to get the free pass but I only need the train one way so I’ll buy the pass separately. I can use my suica card to just pass through the station and show my romance car ticket right? It says I can get an e ticket if I want. ,Lisa W,Hakone-machi,Huntington Beach CA
Hello Some of the traditional Japanese places I would like to stay are not as easy to book from America especially since I don't speak Japanese. I also think I am a little late in my planning for a Christmas- New Years trip. I am interested in Kamakara Hokene Kyoto. Thanks for any insight or advice for me. I suppose I could just stick with places I can book online from home but was intrigued by some others Like Hakone-Ginyu ,mary karen,Hakone-machi,
Hey all as the title says I have a question about the Yokohama Gundam factory. I bought tickets for this Friday the entrance fee and the dock tower viewing. The time I purchased for the latter is 17:05 to 17:50 but the entrance fee says 11:00 to 20:00. I just wanted to make sure. Does this mean I can enter at any time between 11 and 20 or do I have to be there at 11? ,David,,"Manahawkin, New..."
I’m male and looking to get a haircut (shaved head think buddhist monk look) in Osaka. I know about QB House but can they do that or do I have to go elsewhere?

Experts we are looking to spend a week in Okinawa in spring 24'. During our stay we plan to explore the island & beach hop head over the the Kerama Islands for a day do a day of scuba diving visit the aquarium etc. In addition we would like to spend a few of our days at the hotel property we are staying at relaxing at the beach & pool.    With this itinerary and wish list in mind any suggestions of where we should stay in terms of location on Okinawa? Is it better to be closer to Naha or stay somewhere like the Hilton Sesoko with a nice beach but more remote?    In addition if you think of some properties that check all the above boxes in terms of location and great resort amenities please give me some recommendations of hotels. Thank you! ,Kepuhi-Dream,Okinawa City,los angeles
Hi All    We are a group of 14  we will be going to Gotemba Station using shinkansen + Train. (Since we have JRpass and yes I have checked the calculator and it pays off).    We rent a house near Oshino Hokkai.    Based on my research there is a direct bus from Gotemba station to Oshino Hokkai and cost around 1500 per person.    I am just wondering if there is other option like chartered bus with driver that we can hire for 2 days. Is there any website / contact that I can reach out to ? I just want to check whether it is cheaper / slightly expensive / very expensive to do this.    1 Day - Gotemba - Sight seeing fuji 5 lakes - House  2 Day - more sightseeing or go to Gotemba outlet. We are planning to go back to Tokyo using Shinkansen again .    My main concern is that we will be going there around 10-11 April which I think is the peak timing for Cherry blossom near 5 lakes. Im afraid we may have to wait for multiple busses to take us even if we have to split people per bus.    Unfortunately  renting a car is not an option since Indonesia driving licence (even international / translated) is not recognize by Japan. ,Ricky S,,Indonesia
Looking at venturing to Arima Onseen for a day trip on our cruise port stop in Osaka im March 2024 Cruise is in port from 7A to 7P.  We want to try an onsen and explore the town. Most of our trip has centered around big cities so this be a nice break.    We are a family of 4 Myself Wife and 2 boy 10 & 12.  Looking for a more authentic experience. I know there are 2 public onsens Kin no Yu & Gin no Yu. Leaning toward trying those.    Then there is Taiko no Yu. It maybe bigger and have more ammenities but seems like it would be more touristy.    Where to the locals go? Or do they at all?    Would love to hear from someone thats been especially if with family.  Thanks ,Shaun M,Kobe,
Hi. We have 2 days in Tokyo before boarding the Diamond Princess for a 9 day cruise. We'll need some cash for those 2 days and onwards. Is it best to exchange a small amount here in Australia and then more at an ATM in Tokyo? I don't think the ship would give a very good exchange rate? Also are Visa Cards readily accepted in Japan? ,Susie T,,Queensland...
Have been to Tokyo several times and plan to visit other vicinity in mid March for Cherry Blossoms. I have 8D/7N and need to fly in and out of Tokyo due to some constraints. Please advise if Tokyo -Hakone - Mt Fuji - Kyoto - Tokyo is doable. How many days should I allocate and where to stay (@US$300) in Hakone and Mt Fuji. If we should replace Kyoto for add another prefecture that is nearer rich in culture or scenic where would you suggest?. Thanks in advance. ,VibrantAurora,Tokyo,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi Guys  Need urgent help! I am putting together the itinerary for our visit in early Nov to Japan for the first time. It was a last minute decision so haven't got time for a lot of research. Seek your help on day 6 - day 9 of the itinerary. Just to share our intentions for the trip to help provide some insights:  - Nature & landscapes (not a lot of hiking though)  - Autumn foliage  - Experience culture & rural life  - Few shrines / temples  - Not interested in cities overcrowded touristy spots  - Try different foods  - Slow paced sightseeing soaking up the vibes    Here's my plan so far:  Day 1 - Arrive in Tokyo and sightseeing  Day 2 - Day trip to Nikko  Day 3 - Day 5 - Stay in Kawaguchiko area  Day 6 - Day 9 - Need advice on which areas to include??  Day 10 - Head back to Tokyo  Day 11 - Depart for home    For day 6- day 9 I really want to visit some parts of the Alpine corridor - maybe start from Matsumoto - Kamikochi - Shirahone Onsen- Takayama as the area looks stunning in pictures but not sure if early November is too late or too cold. If the route is scenic we don't mind travelling longer. I plan to buy the 4 day Alpine passport to move around.  If this is not feasible are there any other similar places you can recommend from your experience?    Also which is the best place to stay in a traditional Ryoken?  Any unique experiences you can recommend from your travels that was a MUST DO in Japan?  Thanks in advance ,supriya k,Chubu,"Santorini, Greece"
Hi we are intending to spend 5-6 days in Tokyo before hiring a car out to the countryside around the region for another 7 to 9 days for the autumn foliage as we will be here around either mid Oct to early Nov.    After scouring TA we would like to explore Mount Fuji Hakone and Nikko. However Nikko seems to reside quite far away from Mount Fuji and Hakone.    Tokyo (5N in mid Oct)    Nikko (3N in third week of Oct) - Shinkyo Bridge Kanmangafuchi Abyss Akechidaira Ryuzu Waterfall EdoWonderland    Hakone (2N in end Oct) - Open Air Museum Lake Ashinoko Hakone Shrine Mt. Komagatake Ropeway    Mount Fuji (1N in end Oct) - Not sure what is nice here?    1. May I know if these 7-9 days are sufficient to tour all these regions. Driving up to Nikko from either Hakone or Mount Fuji seems to take 4 hours or more - would you please advise a nice midway destination to breakup the driving distance or recommend another area similar to or nicer than Nikko. Any other suggestions on more destinations along the route that I should not miss?    2. How expensive is it to rent a car in Tokyo? Which car rental company would you recommend and its location? I would like to base myself in Tokyo that is near to the car rental company if that is possible as I really hate the luggage tugging process. Or would it be much cheaper to train out and rent from outside?    3. What attractions are there in the Mount Fuji region other than Mount Fuji itself. Would you recommend a great hotel with a great view of Mount Fuji under SGD300 or 20000 yen a night?    4. What hotels would you recommend in Hakone and Tokyo & Nikko? Budget around SGD200-300 or 20k to 30k Yen a night    5. As Tokyo is a relatively expensive city any cost-savings tips would be most appreciated. ,san20sg,Tokyo Prefecture,Singapore

Hi I'm planning to buy a Hakone free pass (2 days) in December just after arriving in Tokyo. Is there any problem with then using those passes in January?

I have a snag in my planned itinerary. On a Sunday I have planned to go to kinkakuji then Nijo castle. I was going to take roketsu class but they are booked up in the afternoon for a group class. So my afternoon is free. I can’t switch the day to a Tuesday ( I was going to do that) because the castle palace is closed on Tuesday as understand. I was going to originally take a Shibori class at their museum but they are closed due to an exhibition in Tokyo. So no art class for me on that afternoon . Bummer. Anyways what should I do in the afternoon after Nijo castle? Something not too far away. I was thinking of adding to that day something from one of my busier days but it’d be out of the way. One day- fushimi Inari and Nara. Another day arashiyama area. Another day kiyomizudera area. Any suggestions? Thanks ,Lisa W,Kyoto,Huntington Beach CA

Hello  We would like to see Fushimi Inari Taisha and Nara. We don't have a lot of time as we have one day in-between leaving our hotel in Kyoto and staying in Osaka for one night. We have a food tour in Osaka at 5pm. Initially my thought was to leave Kyoto - go to Osaka check-in and then take train to Nara and return to Osaka for our 5pm food tour (or send luggage ahead?) However I now see we didn't have Fushimi Inari on our itinerary. There is a possibility we could do Fushimi Inari one evening while in Kyoto. Although I don't want to have it be too late upon getting back that the restaurants might not be open. This is for early November. What is best option? Thank you. ,travelgreats,,Delray Beach...

Hola to all the Japan lovers out there 👋    After doing the quintessential intro tour (Tokyo/Kyoto/Japanese Alps) in 2018 I’ve been considering a return to Japan in 2024 along the following lines:    -------------------    - Duration: Two weeks or so    - Route: A couple of days in Tokyo to reconnect > to then head to Shikoku for a few days along the pilgrimage routes > followed by Kyushu > Couple days on Yakushima > back to Tokyo.    - Time of the year: Given that this is southern Japan I was thinking late March-early April might work (not a fan of excessive heat here)    -------------------    What do the Japan-savvier folks in our midst think am I squeezing in too much? Would I need more time? How many days would you set aside for Shikoku/Kyushu/Yakushima (I’m particularly struggling to work out how long Kyushu needs)? Is late March-early April a good time for that particular bit of Japan?    If this helps travelling-wise I tend to be drawn to hiking temples city action (gardens galleries local eateries) roughly in that order.    Thanks    J ,José R,,

Due to incorrect information and first time on cruise we are too late to book ship excursions on a cruise to Japan in mid April 24 as practically all sold! We are a healthy well-travelled 75yr old couple but had really wanted to avoid the problems and stress of making our own excursions which on a cruise will involve time restrictions and getting in/out of the port and feel badly let down by this.

Would the roads be confusing if we use google map to guide us?

I want to order these online and in advance of when I go to Japan. I've seen several websites but not sure which to use. Is there an official website I can purchase through?

I really have zero interest in visiting Tokyo because I don't like big busy cities that are concrete jungles I don't like crazy busy hordes of people I am not looking for nightlife and I am not a shopper. I much prefer quieter greener more neighborhood-like areas of cities that have interesting walking and wandering opportunities. And I am interested in art culture and gardens. I don't need to run from one must-see tourist site to another.    I am 95% certain I am going to sign up for a tour of Japan that spends time in the countryside hiking. But the tour starts in with 2 nights in Tokyo and ends in Kyoto (which I am enthused about). The second day in Tokyo includes a walking tour seeing Japan Bridge Ueno and National Museum grand Meiji shrine and the Harajuku district.    I would fly into Haneda from the Midwest in the US so I'll be tired and have an internal time clock that will be really screwed up. Normally with a long haul international trip like this I'd come in a couple days prior to the tour so I have time to recover from jet lag and also time to get to know the origin city better.    I have some questions I'd like help with:    1. Knowing how I am already feeling about Tokyo should I just fly in the day the tour starts basically arriving and then immediately joining the trip late afternoon/early evening? I'd just have to power through the first few days of jet lag.    2. Or should I come in a few days before the start of the tour and make the best of seeing some of Tokyo on my terms. If so can you suggest areas/locations (and mid-range hotels) that might best satisfy me?    3. Is there a different smaller city I would be interested in where I could spend a couple days prior to the tour? I'd want a place I could get to within an hour or so directly from the Haneda airport.    I am an experienced international traveler who has visited Asia before but not Japan and I don't speak Japanese.    Thanks in advance.    p.s. my account is screwed up and I am a retired female. ,peter s,Tokyo,

Hello people    I am grateful for helpful responses on my previous query. We are in a quandry with our plans during late december. I am travelling with my wife and we arrive on 24th in Osaka (early morning) and leave on 30th (Early morning). We have effectively 6 full days in Osaka-Kyoto.    I understand Osaka would be a way better choice to spend christmas eve with the illuminations and the general vibrant cacophony of the place. Considering our limited time would it make sense to spend 3 days each in Osaka and Kyoto or 4 in Kyoto and 2 in Osaka? Would greatly appreciate any and all suggestions.

Traveling on Nov 18 (a Saturday). If I start my day at Ritsurin at 7:00 in the garden is it reasonable to visit both Ritsurin Garden and Okayama Korakuen in the same day and not feel rushed?

We really like to explore everything and would like to take the boat ride and have tea etc. at Ritsurin and will be staying for the night lighting at Okayama Korakuen.

I posted a question yesterday about first-time travel to Japan (independent vs. guided tour). We've decided we'll go independently (as we seem to always do except for a couple of guided treks to Machu Picchu and Patagonia).    On to more details. We were thinking of going anywhere from 3 to 5 weeks. We'll visit all the highlights on the tourist circuit - Tokyo Kyoto Osaka Hiroshima. I note that there are excellent off-shoots from both Tokyo and Kyoto - some day trips and some overnighters. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on how long we should plan for a probably only-time trip.    Second related question. We're going to go sometime in September-October (could go into early November). Is late September that much rainier than early to mid-October? We like warm weather (traveled throughout Europe the last two [very hot] summers and survived!!) but obviously rainy conditions aren't very conducive to sightseeing.

Hi. I’ve been reading reviews for about a month and I think I’ve started to confuse myself. Im trying to choose among the Hilton Tokyo ANA Intercontinental Tokyo Hotel Gracery Shinjuku and The Blossom HIBIYA. These are all within our budget. The Hilton has the add on perk that we can accumulate points as we’re Hilton members. We’re a family of 3 2 adults and one teen. Our top priorities are location Shinjuku or Shibuya 3rd Ginza; proximity to transportation comfortable beds and enough bed space for 3. Thanks in advance. My other number one option for a while was the Westin as I’m also a Marriott member and get a hugest discount and points on it. But discarded it because it looks like the location is far from transportation. Did I make the right decision? ,Melissa L,,"Tampa, Florida"

Hi  I with my parents are traveling to India from canada but we have 19 hours stay in Japan and we have to change the airport to take the next flight. The airline is ANA. My parents are on visitor visa in Canada and have Indian passports and I consult with the consulate general of Japan in Canada for their transit visa bit they told me they cannot give transit visa to visitors and told to talk with ANA to provide shore pass. The airport we need to change is from Narita to Haneda airport.  Can please anyone suggest me the best solution to this or more about the Shore pass. Is it difficult to get shore pass or easy.    Thank you ,Satwinder G,,
Hello - we're planning on being in Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka right around Lunar NY in Feb. My understanding is that Japan doesn't celebrate it. Is it safe to assume that all sightseeing sights will be open? Anything we should be aware of in advance--long lines in museums for example? Thank you! ,Marfutka2014,,"Oaxaca, Mexico"
I am finalising our itinerary for the second week in November. After completing the Alpine Route from Nagano to Toyama spending the night in Toyama and then 2 nights in Takayama we unfortunately will not have time to do both the Kurobe GorgeRailway and Shin Hotaka Ropeway( which is not scheduled to be closed on the day I am planning) . Any recommendations on preference.? It's a shame we haven't got time to do both but by the time we factor in Shirawago there is just not enough time or it would be a very busy schedule. Many thanks in advance ,lovetravelling4ever,,
Hi!  My family of 4 are traveling to Japan in March/April 2024. I'm a bit overwhelmed by the types of accomodations and not sure where to start. We typically rent Airbnbs when traveling so we can cook meals but we don't plan to cook much in Japan (with the exception of maybe breakfast.) So we're looking for an apartment or apartment type hotel that has 2 bedrooms small kitchen and maybe a washing machine/dryer. We are traveling with 2 teens. We are spending 6 nights in Toyko and would like to in an area that is walkable to most sights - I've heard Shinjuku and Shibuyi might be areas to start. After Tokyo we are heading to Kyoto and Osaka so if we could leave some of our luggage in storage in Tokyo that would be ideal also.....    Thanks in advance! ,Laura7890,Tokyo Prefecture,

is there usually sufficient snow for beginner ski lessons in niseko during late Feb/early Mar? i want to avoid crowds while ensuring there's enough snow to learn skiing for as a beginner    i need to take ski lessons in niseko as i plan to do a custom boot in niseko    also should i take all my lessons in niseko for ~2 wks? or should i switch between niseko and another nearby ski resort (if there's any?) ,cl7,Niseko-cho,

So I am planning on getting tickets for the Sumo tournament in Fukuoka on 12th November (Sunday) taking the Shinkansen (JRR pass no rental car) there from Kyoto and returning on the same day then planning to move onto the alps region on the next day:    13th November: Early train to Kanazawa and see Kenrokuen Ninja temple Nagimachi and Higachi-chaya. Overnight in Kanazawa.    14th November: Train or Bus? to Takayama visiting the old town and Hida Folk Village. Overnight in Takayama.    15th November: Planning to visit Kamikochi. This has to be done on this day since it closes on November 16th. How to get there by bus? I checked the Nohi bus website but did not find the according route or possibility to reserve. Reserving on phone would be difficult since I don’t speak Japanese? And how to get from there to Matsumoto?    Then Overnight in Matsumoto and move on towards Nakasendo Nahano and ultimately Tokyo.    Does this seem to rushed or possible?    My other approch would be:    13th and 14th November in Kanazawa    15th November drive to Kamikochi hike for half a day there and then go back to Takayama.    This way I would have more time in Kanazawa but having to go back the same way by bus..    Alternatively I consider to skip Kamikochi and spend one more night in Kanazawa possibly while visiting Iya Valley instead from Osaka before?    Would it be possible to drive to Iya Valley from Osaka or Kyoto by train and hike there for a day trip and then return to Osaka? I heard it is pretty remote and not easily reachable by train? ,David M,,
Hey guys I'll be in Japan from 21st Nov to 11th Dec.    While I've carefully planned out most of my days i'm confused about one of them.    So here's the question.    For a day trip should I go to Nikko/Mt Mitashi/Kawaguchiko from Tokyo?  Or is a day trip to Amanohashidate and Ine from Kyoto a better option?    Note: This is over and above spending 4 full days each in both Tokyo and Kyoto. Also I'm already doing Kamakura(from Tokyo) Nara(from Kyoto) Himeji(from Osaka) and Miyajima (from Hiroshima in fact i'm spending a night) as day trips. I've planned these to fall on transit days so that its time efficient. ,Yudhajit M,,Kolkata (Calcutta...
We've traveled all over and have never been on a tour (other than a city walking tour) in our lives. Japan though seems a little daunting perhaps because of the language barrier (and inability to read and therefore to translate).

Hi  We intend to stay near Tengachaya station and make day trips to Kyoto Nara. It seems the shortest cheaper route via Rapid Express train takes about 1 hour to Kyoto station (30 minutes to Osaka station and 30 minutes to Kyoto). Is there an easier way out?    Or should we change location? It’s easy to get here from Kansai Airport.    Thank you. ,StarryNite,Osaka,
Hello and thank you for your time.    My husband and I have a reservation at a high end restaurant in Tokyo and the dress code is “smart casual” I’m trying to get by on this trip with two pairs of nicer tennis shoes (light color and an all black leather pair. Both new balance 237) and really don’t want to bring dress shoes for one dinner on a 17 day trip. My plan was nice hair makeup jewelry and an all black mock turtleneck once piece jumper I have with the black shoes (or possibly black nicer jeans and with black sleeveless turtleneck) will thy fly for dress casual? I’m quite tall with big feet (size 11 US) and don’t think I’d be able to buy something on the fly there but I’m trying to pack very light and minimal for the trip. Any advice appreciated! ,blastermags,Tokyo,"Oakland, California"

I am travelling around Japan on a cruise and Sakaiminato is one of numerous ports. I am going through all the excursions offered by the ship for the various ports of call. They are very expensive so I am being very selective with choices. Many of the tours make a “feature” of including free time or shopping time which I think is a bit of a joke when you are paying a fortune for something that costs them nothing.    The idea of this post is to see places where it is worth exploring on foot around the port area or travel by local transport to places of interest. I prefer this than being part of a large group. Knowing Japan is very punctual with public transport means I can hopefully assure I will be back onboard in time for departure. My only concern will be conversing in English as I don’t speak Japanese. I will endeavour to learn a few phrases before I go.    Other options would be to arrange a local private tour and get some other passengers to share the cost. It would be much nicer travelling with a small group rather than a bus load. It would be great if you have any recommendations.    My husband and I are both 70 and reasonably active so walks are fine. Not strenuous treks or ground being too rocky or rough. I know a cruise isn’t necessarily the best way to see Japan but as a first time visit it will be a lovely way to check it out.    Any suggestions would be most appreciated.    Thanks.

We have a trip to Tokyo at the beginning of April next year.    One aussie one new zealander.    I haven't researched this at all so apologies for my laziness.    What are the ins and outs of having a very simple ceremony - celebrant in a park do the vows and done.    I remember looking at getting married in Thailand and it involved visiting two embassies for our respective countries and getting paperwork done etc. Hoping it is a bit easier in Japan.    One final question - how difficult would it be to do if I want to keep the actual ceremony a secret from my bride to be? How much of a surprise can I realistically make it? ,Trevor G,Tokyo,"Brisbane, Australia"
I am not connected to Asukadera community. I’m an architect book author and publisher in Germany. But there is no contact line to Tripadvisor regarding this post on Trip Advisor:  The title „der Asuka Tempel der älteste in Japan“ written by BrainBaier (25. August 2015) is misleading. So I'll use the Japan Forum:  Explanation: The Asuka-dera (Asukadera) is not the oldest temple in Japan as an enthusiastic review headlines here. Discovered in the Asuka Plain were only traces of about 50 temples or palaces of which the Asukadera 飛鳥寺 founded in 588 was the most remarkable. It was not until 1957 that the foundation remains were excavated. However only traces of foundations have been preserved because like all great temples it was moved to Nara as the monks' quarters of Hokoji when the new capital was founded (710). There in Nara it was given the name Gangōji 元興寺 and was completely destroyed by fire in 1196.  The present buildings of the Gokurakubō in Nara its new name are at most about 700 years old and stand south of the Kōfukuji in Nara.  However the house built on the floor plan of the Asukadera contains the oldest Buddhist sculpture in Japan (606) the Shaka statue by the bronze caster Tori!  Peter C.

Hi all!    I'll be going to Japan next month for the first time as a solo traveller. I am scared but excited. The trip is just under two weeks and I plan to visit Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka with daytrips to Mt Fuji/Aokigahara and Nara as well as get the train to and from the airports I'm flying from. I was wondering if anyone would be able to explain how the subway and different train systems work? Anything and everything will help. Things I'm worried about right now are if tickets between stations are exclusively for that trip or a certain timeframe if daypasses/transport cards are a thing that are worth getting. I understand a JR pass would be very convenient but am not confident I would get my money's worth though. If it helps for context I am familiar with Perth's Transperth system (Australia).    Thanks in advance! Also if anyone would like to additionally drop recommendations on things not to miss in each area or is even going in the same timeframe and would want to make friends with another traveller I'd love to know! :) ,Jasmine <3,,"Perth, Australia"

I understand the Borderless exhibit should hopefully be open again by the time we visit Tokyo in mid-May 2024 otherwise we will do the Planets exhibit instead. I read it is good to go to either exhibit near opening time. I thought maybe we could do breakfast at Tsukiji before heading over (or else the reverse - visit TeamLab first then Tsukiji). Obviously I am worried about crowds at both places but am more worried about the crowds at TeamLab. In any case it is a lot quicker to drive between to the two according to Google Maps - a 15 minute drive vs. 40+ minutes on public transportation. Will it be easy enough to hail a cab on the spot at Tsukiji and/or the TeamLab locations? Otherwise I may need to decouple these activities though they look geographically close.

i guys I am a relatively frequent traveller and when I travel to a country that doesn't have universal healthcare I usually purchase travel insurance to be able to be seen in a hospital if needed. I am coming back from a trip to Brazil where I purchased a cheap insurance from https://www.insubuy.com/.    My gf needed to see a doctor so I tried to use the insurance. First it was a nightmare to get in touch with it. The only way to contact the insurance was through a US number and there was no way to call collect from Brazil. When I finally managed to get in touch with it the insurance just said I had to go to the hospital on my own collect a lot of evidence that the medical care was needed and claim the reimbursement later.    Another one of my trips is coming now (Japan) and given medical costs in Japan are significantly higher than in Brazil this time I wanted to purchase a travel insurance that is cheap but at least I am able to use it if I need.    I figured people in this community explored different options of travel insurance does anyone have a recommendation of an insurance I could contact through whatsapp/email or at least that they would point me to a specific hospital where I could go without needing to pay out of pocket and later fight for a reimbursement (I want an insurance without deductibles)?    For reference I live in the US (BR citizenship) and the insubuy insurance for 3 weeks in Japan cost ~40USD ,fleno,Osaka,State of Sao Paulo
I have a tentative plan I have been thinking through and want to know if there are any major errors in my thinking. I am taking a tour that starts in Tokyo & ends in Kyoto. Even though I don't have much interest at all in Tokyo I had initially planned to fly in a few days early just to decompress from the long trip. Then I had planned to add a couple days on the end to see more of Kyoto because that city is of much more interest to me than Tokyo.    Now I just discovered that the day my tour ends in Kyoto is Nov. 23 which is Labor Thanksgiving day. And this is the busiest day of the year in Kyoto. I don't like the idea of being there then at all.    So I came up with another idea that I think for me would be a much better plan but I want some feedback to make sure there isn't a major flaw I hadn't thoughts about.    Rather than flying from the US to Tokyo and adding Tokyo time prior to the tour I would fly to Osaka/Kyoto several days before my tour starts. My flight from the US would get into Osaka Itami at 6:40 pm. Then I could either stay in an airport hotel for the night or try to make it to Kyoto that same night (might be too exhausted if it's complicated though).    At the end of my couple days in Kyoto I would take the high speed train directly to Tokyo and meet my tour in the hotel late afternoon or early evening. Financially the only additional cost is the train from Kyoto to Tokyo since the big plane ticket is the same price whether I fly to Osaka or Tokyo.    Then when the tour ends on Nov. 23 I would just fly back to the US that day from Kyoto/Osaka.    But I have never been to Japan and even though I am a very experienced international traveler I don't know how intimidating it would be to take the train between the 2 cities. Do you have and thoughts about this idea? ,peter s,Tokyo,

Is there any way to reserve a seat on any bus that travels to/from Korenkei Gorge that connects to any of the trains in the Nagoya area? I ask as I plan to travel on a weekday in mid Nov (likely 13th 14th 15th or 20th or 21st). I would like to stay for the light up but am not sure I’ll be able to get back to Kyoto (last train for JR pass is 10:37pm). It would be ideal if I could book a seat on a bus yet I understand they likely don’t run to schedule due to traffic. What time do you think I would need to leave to be able to get on a bus (assuming a queue) and back to Nagoya to catch the train back to Kyoto? ,EnjoyScenicTravel,Aichi Prefecture,Philadelphia...
Ok so tomorrow’s my birthday. Because of missing our initial flight and having to get rebooked we got pushed a day back on everything. Originally I was gonna stay one night in nikko(today) and head to Osaka for my birthday evening(tomorrow). Now I’m kinda torn on what I should do for my birthday tomorrow go to nikko or skip it and go to Osaka.    The big thing that’s making me wonder is we’d probably need two days in nikko since I have some things to do in akiba tomorrow before we go to Tokyo station to head to nikko. So it’ll probably be after or very close to the temples closing when we get there. Which means we’d basically have to do the lake and temples on the same day(17th) and then head to Osaka on the 18th 19th then onto Hiroshima etc.    TL:DR How nice is nikko really and would you spend your birthday there? ,Nathan Smith Jr,,Los Angeles...

Hi - We just returned from a 2 week trip centered around Tokyo. Schedule was:  Day 1 - Tokyo with afternoon train to Suwa Nagano (visiting friends)  Days 2-4 - Suwa (with Japanese friends) - morning train to Yokohama  Days 5-6 - Yokohama - afternoon train to Kamakura  Days 7-9 - Kamakura - morning train to Shinjuku  Days 10-13 - Tokyo (stayed in Shinjuku)  I'm happy to answer any questions you have.    A few quick observations:  - Having some sort of pass for the subway/train is super convenient. We purchased the 1 Day passes for the Minatomirai line in Yokohama and the Tokyo Subway pass for the last part of our trip. I had planned to get the Subway pass as a bundle with our Limousine Bus but we were rerouted and ended up landing at Narita at 8:30pm instead of Haneda at 2pm. We spent a good amount of time looking for a place to purchase the pass one morning but were successful.  - Next time I'll have our pocket wi-fi sent ahead to the hotel instead of picking up at the airport (see above - rerouted). Japan Wireless was amazing. I sent a message while in-flight explaining the situation and they sent our wifi to our hotel.  - Yamato Transfer for luggage is amazing! We used it twice and it was flawless. We packed a smaller bag and sent our bigger bag ahead to our Yokohama hotel. When we were reunited with it there we repacked and sent the larger bag ahead to our Tokyo hotel avoiding getting on and off trains and staying in smaller hotels with 2 larger bags.  - So many places had ipad screen ordering systems. There's almost always an option to change languages. It's great to order bit by bit.  - Google Maps was a great help especially with quickly figuring out what platform to be on for the subways.  - Saturday in Ginza is nuts!  - We enjoyed a nice variety of hotels. I wrote reviews for each. Although we lived in Japan for 2 years and have visited before I had forgotten how small some Japanese hotel rooms are. We managed but I'll do a little more research next time knowing we like a bit more space now.  - Japanese service and the friendliness/helpfulness of Japanese people in general is second to none. Basically anytime we looked or felt confused someone approached us to help. It was amazing!  - Fuji is very shy in the summer. We got a glimpse the last day and that was about it. ,SusanMSPWorld,Tokyo,Saint Paul...
Hi everyone    I really need some feedback about our proposed itinerary for this November. I have done so much research but I've had trouble making final decisions. This is mainly because the trip was originally 3 weeks for my daughter and myself. My husband and son later decided that they could come too - but only for 2 weeks. This has made it complicated!    I know it doesn't really make sense for my daughter and I to return to meet my husband and son in Tokyo but it's what we would like to do if we can make it work.    November 28 - Arrive in Tokyo (My daughter and I arrive in Tokyo around 8pm)  Nov 29 - Tokyo  Nov 30 - Tokyo  Dec 1 - Kanazawa  Dec 2 - Kanazawa  Dec 3 - Takayama  Dec 4 - Takayama  Dec 5 - Tokyo (or overnight at Hakone or Kawaguchiko)  Dec 6 - Tokyo (maybe a day trip to Yokohams Nikko Kamakura today and/or tomorrow?)  Dec 7 - Tokyo (My husband and son arrive in Tokyo around 8pm)  Dec 8 - Tokyo  Dec 9 - Osaka (to use as a base for trip to Koyasan the next day. Hotel close to station)  Dec 10 - Koyasan temple stay  Dec 11 - Osaka (use as a base after return from Koyasan and before Kinosaki)  Dec 12 - Kinosaki Onsen  Dec 13 - Kyoto  Dec 14 - Kyoto  Dec 15 - Kyoto  Dec 15 - Kyoto  Dec 16 - Kyoto  Dec 17 - Hiroshima  Dec 18 - Hiroshima  Dec 19 - Tokyo  Dec 20 - Fly home (morning flight)    Does it make sense for us to use Osaka as a base between our trips to Koyasan and Kinosaki Onsen?    Is it a good idea to stay for 2 nights each in Kanazawa and Takayama. I originally had 1 night in each place but I looked at travel times and realised that this probably wouldn't work. We also want to visit Shirakawago.    I am happy to reorder destinations but I will need to book accommodation soon - and stop overthinking everything!    Thanks in advance for your help with this. I will be so grateful for your input! ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"
TripAdvisor hive mind I need your help! I have cancelled a winter holiday to Egypt and Jordan and we are pivoting to Japan. I love Japan and have visited twice but this is very last minute and during the winter with two college students and two active older folks. We fly in/out of Tokyo and will also visit Osaka/Nara/Kyoto. Any suggestions would be helpful in terms of other southern/warmer spots (eg not going to Nikko on this trip). Hiroshima is a possibility but interested in other options nearby/en route. City culture hiking museums all of interest. Seems like Fuji is too cold for hiking but maybe there is a nice place to view it with some walks? We are serious lovers of Japanese foods so any advice on tour guides or reservation facilitators would be appreciated. Open to all suggestions. Just cancelled our other trip today.

So far:  Tokyo – 4 nights (booked)  Kyoto – 5 nights (booked)  Koya-san – 3 nights (booked)  Hiroshima – 2 or 3 nights  Miyajima – 1 night  Western Honshu or Kyushu ? – 3-5 nights  Osaka ? – 1-2 night  Bessho Onsen – 4 nights  Nozawa Onsen – 4 nights (including Christmas)  Tokyo or Nagano ? – 2 nights    These last two nights are 26-27 Dec. Our flight home on 28th is not until 6:30pm.  Returning from Nozawa Onsen to Tokyo is maybe 4 hours and Nagano seems a convenient place however it doesn't sound like there's much draw there. So perhaps the question is - where best to spend the last two nights in Tokyo? We will have spent out early days in Shinjuku area. He will want to shop for souvenirs and see bright lights. I'll want cozy spaces and lovely gardens. In common at least is our love of eating. I'd love some help to decide please. ,Katherine W,,
Hey all    Looking for some advice we will be going to Japan in June 2024 we can rent a car for €1000 but we're wondering would it be better to use the train system instead. Struggling to understand the train system it's seems expensive?    Any help would be great ,Dane T,,"Sligo, Ireland"
Hi! Getting really excited for our spring break Japan adventure with my husband and our boys (ages 5 and 10). We have six nights in Kyoto and will probably spend one of these in Osaka and one in Nara leaving three full days for Kyoto. It will be toward the very beginning of our trip and I thought it would be a good idea to hire a guide to show us the ropes and make a few of the sites more memorable. I'm hoping the guide will also help us learn about Japanese customs and how to get around (though we will research and discuss with the kids in advance). I'm planning this for the second full day of our trip just in case we're completely beat after travel from the U.S.    So my question for the experts and those who've visited: Where would you suggest we have the guide take us? We will likely have the guide for six hours and I expect we'll want to stop for lunch. Ideally we'd find a spot where we could visit several sites without too much transit between them as we don't want our tour time eaten up by travel. What would be cool for the kids and also somewhere having a guide is helpful?    For example would Kiyomizu-dera Temple + Kodai-ji Temple + Gion be a good itinerary? I'm expecting that a guide would make the boys first temple visit more special than if we did it solo.    In case it's helpful my boys are good travelers and adventurous eaters. I'm hoping that they will be excited to visit beautiful places and learn new things but they are kids and they may be jet-lagged.    THANK YOU! ,REBChicago,Kyoto,"Chicago, Illinois"

Hi I am currently deciding two places to stay for our 6 nights in Nagoya. One place is near Taiko Dori (last stop on the Sakuradori Line) and the other place is near Kanayama Station (Meitetsu Line). Ideally I would like to stay within walking distance of Nagoya Station itself but unfortunately I could not find anything nearby with the kind of space/kitchen facilities etc. that we want. May I know if anyone living in Nagoya can advise on which station (Taiko-Dori metro station or Kanayama station) is more convenient and will involve less walking when changing lines? During our time in Nagoya we intend to visit Legoland Nabana no sato Suzuka Circuit SC Maglev City Science Museum Little World etc.  Thank you! ,Tania,Nagoya,
I'm going to Japan in a few weeks and will be spending time in Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka.    I'm looking to buy antiques woodblock prints and things like oni masks.

Hi everyone  we are Alessandra and Gabriele and we will be in Japan for our first time for 13 full days from 23 December to 4 January (leaving on 5). We are 31 and 34 y.o. and we are fond of nature and culture.    Thanks to the precious insight we found on the forum and on Japan-guide we are figuring out our high-level itinerary but we still have some doubts that we hope we can solve through your suggestions and help :)    We will focus on Tokyo and Kyoto areas. We would like to try to avoid too much moving around so for now we have decided NOT to include Hiroshima and Miyajima.    The itinerary we have in mind would be as follows:  Day 1: Tokyo  Day 2: Tokyo  Day 3: Tokyo  Day 4: Tokyo  Day 5: Tokyo + transfer to Hakone  Day 6: Hakone + transfer to Kyoto  Day 7: Kyoto  Day 8: Kyoto  Day 9: Kyoto + day trip to Nara  Day 10: Kyoto + day trip to Koyasan  Day 11: Kyoto + day trip to Osaka  Day 12: Kanazawa  Day 13: Shirakawa-go    - Do you agree with sacrificing Takayama or would you include it at the expense of Hakone?  - What to chose between Nikko or Kamakura?  - Is it correct to leave Kanazawa at the end or is it more efficient to do it immediately after Tokyo leaving Hakone at the end?    We realize that these are many questions but even just one comment is valuable to us! Thank you so much for your helpful advice!    Thank you all!

What is the traffic and taxi situation in Kyoto? Google maps suggests we could save a significant amount of time using taxis over public transportation. Is the traffic bad enough in Kyoto that the travel times listed online are not realistic? We are staying near Karasuma and plan to visit Gion Arashiyama Kinkakuji Fushimi-Inari etc.    I usually default to bus train and metro but if we can cut 2/3 of the travel time using a taxi it may be worth considering. ,SixOneTwo,Kyoto,Minneapolis...

We are staying at the Dotonbori Hotel and have a 9:30am weekday flight out of Kansai International Airport (KIX). 2 adults and 2 kids (8-10 years old). Luggage-wise we should have 1 larger suitcase and 1 rolling carryon along with backpacks.    What would you recommend us take to get to KIX?

Hey we will be spending our last day in Kyoto using the Kansai Wide Pass (we fly in a few weeks). We have a flight booked from KIX to Okinawa at 6.40 am the next day. I was hoping to get the last train or the one prior before the pass runs out on a Friday.    No point staying in Osaka and sleeping until 3am as we will have to get a taxi to the airport. If it's reasonable we may get an airport Hotel but happy to stay awake in the airport or use a lounge as I'm sure we will need to start checking in by 4am.    Looking at the timetable the last train from memory wasn't very late around 9 or 10.30pm from Osaka to Kix unless I'm wrong. Not booked hotels in Osaka yet so don't know what station we will be coming from.    Any suggestions or correct times regarding the trains would be really helpful. Know the pass will expire at midnight so plan to be heading towards the airport before then.    Thanks 😊 ,CHOCABLOC,,"London, United..."
Hello There is this famous bento shop inside Tokyo station that I want to go to. Can I use the SUICA card instead of buying a Tokyo station admission ticket?

This might be a silly question but does Japan have Hothands air-activated hand warmers? Doesn't have to be Hothands specifically but any kind of hand warmers? If so how much do these typically cost?

Hi everyone    I want to do a 3 day hike from Kamikochi to Oku-Hotaka then stay at Hotaka-dake hut then down to Yokoo hut via Karasawa and maybe stay there another night to spread things out a bit or keep going on to Kamikochi.    I am moderately experienced I have done overnight hikes with 1000m+ of elevation change per day and I am comfortable with rock scrambling. But I don't have any special climbing experience or equipment. At this point I speak no Japanese but I will learn a bit before I go in September.    I would prefer to get a guide as I am not familiar with the area at all or Japanese. In fact it would be our first time visiting Japan. But my partner doesn't want to get a guide so that we can be more relaxed without a stranger with us for 2-3 days.    So my question is how easy is it to do this hike for my level of experience/Japanese without a guide? ,Andrew K,Kamikochi,

So we are a family of 4 (2 teenage girls) traveling to Japan for 2 weeks to Japan in March/April 24. We are first timers to Japan and have a rough outline of our plans (4n Tokyo 4n Kyoto (incl. Nara) 3n Osaka (incl. USJ) 1 night Fujikawaguchiko & 1n close to Haneda before our flight back).    All Hotels are booked and we are generally happy with them but the one in Kyoto I am not certain is located centrally enough. Any thoughts please if it is or what area would be better to stay?    We are booked at the Hotel Tou Nishinotoin for 4 nights which looks fairly nice gets good reviews and appears to be located a 10/15 minute from Kyoto Station.    Our thought was as we will arrive by Shinkansen from Tokyo leave by train for Osaka and also plan a daytrip from Kyoto to Nara it would be handiest to stay close enough to the station. But looking at the map now in some more detail I realize that some of the sights in Kyoto are quite some track to there according to google maps.    Gion seems to be about 40m walk Arashiyama Bamboo Grove about 40m by public transport Kinkaku-ji about 45m by public transport ... so nothing seems to be really close to the hotel.    Any thoughts would be much appreciated. ,Daniel S,Kyoto,"Newry, United..."
Hello fellow travellers  I am in Japan 6-7 weeks for the first time from mid-November. My 17 year old son arrives late Nov and we have a month together until late Dec a few days post-Christmas. It is our last journey of his childhood neither of us like to travel fast and I don't have heaps of money. I enjoy a sense of connection and living in a place rather than consumption of a lot of sights at faster pace. My son is probably keener on cities and I on smaller towns. But both keen on traditional and going slow.    I will spend 15 days solo in Kii Peninsula hiking Kumano Kodo and then maybe finish with a couple of nights rest in Isi-Shima (a good place close to Shingu end-point before returning to Tokyo?).  I am wondering whether to spend time in Nara before my son arrives or with him? People seem to like it and it's not too big (and has hikes!).    When he arrives we have booked:  - 4 nights Tokyo (air-bnb)  - 5 nights Kyoto (Hiroshima day trip?) (air-bnb)  - 3 nights Koya-san (temple stay)  Intending then  - 4 nights Osaka (Nara as a day trip?) (hostel or hotel - 4 nights too long?)  then unsure. I am thinking possibly Nagana area. I like the sound of Matsumoto Takayama maybe Hakuba for skiing Hiraju Onsen. For a few days over Christmas I wondered about the small town of Bessho for some gentle friendliness. Or some other luxury at this time? Then 2 nights in Tokyo before heading home.    Could people please comment on the parts I haven't booked specifically Isa-Shima Nara Hiroshima and the last fortnight open to any areas of Japan and at a slower pace than first night together in cities.  At the outset I had hoped to spend perhaps a week in one area and just live rather than sight-see. Always preferably somewhere with walking trails for me and easy inexpensive food for the boy. Thank you! ,Katherine W,,

Hello  I am currently at the initial phase of doing an ad-hoc planning to Central Japan (chubu region) on the week of 20th Nov to 30th Nov (thereabout)    I would like to ask advise on :    1) Where are the prefectures i should aim for to catch nice autumn foliage? I'm thinking out loud here of the areas: Toyama Gifu Nagano Nagoya...    Note: I understand autumn foliage peak period are best seen in Kyoto / Tokyo region but we would like to see new places this time round.    2) Is it also worth visiting Tateyama Alpine around that period (understand it's way past autumn) but wonders if its still worth checking things out during that time or it's challenging to travel to that part of the world?    3) Open to suggestions - what are the places to best enjoy autumn in Chubu region or elsewhere    4) We are looking to do a self-drive itinerary hope it's still safe to drive around that period of end Nov?    Apologies for basic questions as I'm still doing preliminary research here. Appreciate your feedback.    Thanks. ,BongTravels,Chubu,Kuala Lumpur...

I have 3 nights booked in Hakone in a hotel called Tsukinoya. I just found out it does not have a shower. Anyone knows about this place has anyone stayed there? The main question is if that is the best place to see Mt. Fuji or should i try and find a place around 200.00 is my budget in the Kawaguchiko lake region for a better view. I understand that Hakone has a ropeway and so does Kawaguchiko and the Lake Kawaguchiko is much closer than Hakone. Not sure what I should do. Can I take the train for a half day and see Lake Kawaguchiko and take something away from Hakone. I am also doing a side trip in Hakone to Kamakura for the big buddha. So much to see.

Hey! Planning our second trip to Japan next year in 2024 this time in Koyo season.    We will be going back to Tokyo (dividing the days in half at the beginning and end of the trip in early December) to Kyoto at the end of November (before the last leg in Tokyo) but we have a full section of our trip we are still shuffling a little bit and we wanted your advice If possible:    Coming from Tokyo:    DAY 1 (Nov 13th) - Shinkansen to Kanazawa. Kenrokuen in the morning for Koyo viewing and then to Matsumoto after a late lunch to spend the evening and have some dinner (maybe see castle at night).    Day 2 (Nov 14th) - Morning in Matsumoto for the castle and some photography and then potentially passing through Narai-juku for a few pictures and onto Magome to spend the night at a Ryokan.    Day 3 (Nov 15th) - Nakasendo hike from Magome to Tsumago then taking the bus + trains from Nagiso to spend the night at Nagoya near the station.    Day 4 (Nov 16th) - This day is open what we would like to do for sure is arrive in the early afternoon (maybe 2-3 PM) in Miyajima to spend the night and to be there the next day. Any ideas of what we could do between Nagoya and Miyajima? (that is not Hiroshima which we visited last time).    Day 5 (Nov 17th) - Full day for Miyajima    Days 6 7 and 8 (Nov 18th 19th 20th) - Not sure what do here. We would be coming from Miyajima and then going to Yakushima so were obviously thinking of Kyushu and maybe 1 day in Fukuoka 1 around Kumamoto (Takachiho gorge?) and then 1 day in Kagoshima to take the ferry on Nov 20 to Yakushima?    Days 9 10 and 11 (Nov 21th 22nd 23rd) - Yakushima  Days 12 13 (Nov 24 25) - Flight Yakushima to Osaka and rest of the time around Osaka    Days 14 15 (Nov 26 27) - We absolutely loved Koyasan in our first trip last year so we wanted something with a similar vibe and landscape. Was planning to go to Kumano Kodo mainly to see Nachi Taisha and Nachi falls maybe hike a bit around Daimonzaka. Any suggestions for how to best approach it within this itinerary? (we would then go back to the Kyoto and Nara area).    Then onto Nara and Kyoto...    --------------------    Any itinerary critique (especially If too rushed or any leg does not make sense) and any advice would be super appreciated! (especially for day 4 days 6-7-8 and days 14-15). Our plan is to try to enjoy Koyo season as much as possible we do love photography especially for landscapes and shrines I think the timing would work right in an average year from what I´m seeing. ,Mariano M,,Buenos Aires...

Hi! Would appreciate peoples thoughts and strategies for jetlag!    We're planning a two week trip from the UK to Japan next May. I have got down to two flight options (12 hours flights) A 0940-0540 (local times) and B 1920-1520 (local times)    I'm leaning towards option B - would shift our UK times to around 2100-0500 the week before so thought is we'd sleep for a few hours at the end of the flight out and then tough it out for the rest of day in Tokyo.    Was pondering option A which would stay awake during the flight then in Tokyo book an Airbnb with self check starting the night before we arrive and then sleep 0700-1200 local time. I'm not a great sleeper on planes so this has that advantage.    Any thoughts and advice much appreciated! ,worthywow,,Great Malvern...
Hi everyone! I am planning on being in Kyoto the day of the Jidai Matsuri and the Kurama fire festival (October 22nd). I was wondering if anyone here has been to either of these festivals and if so if it is worth it to try to go to both on the same day. I definitely want to see the Jidai Matsuri since it will be close to our hotel and relatively easy for us to catch but I have mixed feelings about the Kurama fire festival. I'm worried that it will be too clouded to be enjoyable but the whole fire aspect looks like fun. Has anyone been to the Kurama fire festival? Is it worth attending? Would it be reasonable to try to attend both? ,Julia G,Kyoto,

Are 3 full days enough?  2- We understand that Hakone is nearby Tokyo. Is it worth staying overnight or is a day trip sufficient?  3- Are four days in Kyoto sufficient? What day trips would you recommend from Kyoto? Is Nara a better day trip from Kyoto or from Osaka?  4- Would you suggest adding any must-visit places that are currently missing?

We had a wonderful trip to Japan in November 2019 and are excited to return this November. But I have forgotten all I knew about booking and riding the trains so I am asking for advice.    We have only 3 trips and I ran them through the JR Pass calculator to find that a 7-day pass will cost more than individual tickets. So we will be purchasing those as we go each day of travel.    Our flight from Seattle arrives at NRT at 16:35 and we will go straight to Kyoto. We will take the Narita Express into Tokyo and then a Nozomi Shinkansen to Kyoto to get there as quickly as possible. We plan to buy reserved seats. Questions:    Should we change from NEx to the Shinkansen at Tokyo Station or Shinagawa? From reading other posts it appears Tokyo Station is better as the train originates there so we have more time to board. I understand the station is more complicated but I have printed out a station map. Will commuter traffic still crowd the station at this time? It will be after 18:00 when we arrive probably later.    Can we purchase both the NEx and Shinkansen tickets from an agent at Narita or do we just buy the NEx there and then buy the Shinkansen to Kyoto at the station in Tokyo when we get there? If we buy them together at Narita how much time do we leave between trains to find our way to the train platform in Tokyo for the Shinkansen?    I just want to understand what we need to know and do as this will be after the long flight from Seattle and we will be tired and maybe not thinking clearly. I appreciate your help.    After Kyoto we will take the train to Uno for the “art island”. I will post a separate question about that train journey later. ,Enzian,,Seattle

I’m travelling to Japan in March 2024 for 15 days and below is the itinerary I’m planning after some exhausting research but I need a second opinion. The Idea is to travel westward till I can get close enough to Fukuoka to take a flight to Yakushima Island which will be my final destination (before coming back to Tokyo):    Day 1 - Land early morning in Tokyo  Day 2 - Tokyo  Day 3 - Tokyo to Hakone day trip  Day 4 - Fly from Tokyo to Kyoto  Day 5 - Kyoto  Day 6 - Kyoto to Himeji by train  Day 7 - Himeji to Onomichi by train  Day 8 - Onomichi (the cycling route)  Day 9 - Onomichi to Hiroshima by train  Day 10 - Hiroshima to Fukuoka by train (to catch a flight) and then fly to Yakushima Island  Day 11 - Yakushima (with a rental car)  Day 12 - Yakushima (with a rental car)  Day 13- Yakushima to Tokyo by flight  Day 14 - Tokyo  Day 15 - Fly back home from Tokyo    What do you think of this? If possible please suggest any changes. Thanks in advance! ,Rhiju Talukdar,,"New Delhi, India"
Hi all I will be in Japan with my family (me partner three year old newborn) and we will be visiting Yamagata for a few days in between stops in Tokyo. On the way back to Tokyo is it worth stopping for a few hours or even a night in Sendai? It’s basically the same travel time back to Tokyo with or without the stop-off anyway so it’s not really going to affect any other plans all that much.    My mate who lives in Yamagata is sceptical but I would love to see somewhere new even for a few hours. Would we get much out of a two/three hour stroll in February (even if it’s just to a few parks for example) and having a local meal somewhere or should we just head straight back to Mega City One in what I’m assured is the best Shinkansen? (Plus if we do go for it then I presume there is luggage storage at all train stations…right?) Thanks in advance for any thoughts! ,TheOExpress🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇭🇰,Sendai,"Hong Kong, China"
We are an older couple and will be staying in Tokyo for a week in May. We are looking for advice on the best area for us to stay. We are very interested in street food but not the type you get in the touristy areas. We would like to try places in back streets and where locals eat. We also want to see historical sites but we can use the train system to do that. We would like to stay close to a green line station and not too far from central Tokyo because we plan on taking day trips from Tokyo Central station. We were looking at the Asakusa area but it's a bit far from the centre of Tokyo. Ginza is also too upmarket for us. Any suggestions? Thanks ,SandraB1958,Tokyo,Alstonville...
Hello everyone    We will be in Tokyo later this month and on one of the afternoons we will meet another family (friends of ours who are incidentally also visiting Tokyo so we re excited to catch up with them in this exciting city).    For this am looking for recommendations on a good venue where we can meet and catch up - perhaps a park where we can sit down (like a picnic kids can play around adults can talk) or a coffee shop close to an outdoor playground or something similar. We will be 4 adults and 5 kids between all of us.    Thank you ,NeverJetLagged,Tokyo,"Singapore, Singapore"

I’ll be visiting Huis Ten Bosch on November 24 yet staying in Nagasaki that evening. I’d like to stay at the park till closing (10:00pm) yet just realized the last train to Nagasaki leaves at 10:15pm and there is no way to make a reservation to confirm a seat. How difficult will it be to get on the last train (considering there are likely to be a lot of people visiting due to the holiday weekend) and at what time do you think I need to be at the station to ensure I get on the train? Any thoughts on how I could not end up stranded? ,EnjoyScenicTravel,Nagasaki,Philadelphia...
We are planning a day trip to Osaka from Kyoto mid week. I have roughed out the following plan. Can the experts give some feedback?  Train Kyoto to Osaka arrive 10-1030.

Hi    We’re planning to visit Yamagata area early/mid-Feb. We would like to see the beauty of Ginzan Onsen at night but we couldn’t find any available hotels near it. Our plan is to hire a car with a driver for 4 hours or for a whole day so we wouldn’t have to worry about taxi fares at night and finding one.    Hoping someone could recommend a site to hire rental cars with drivers. I did try to check the internet but most are rental cars only or if there are drivers they do not service the area. 😔    Thank you in advance! ,dark_mimic,Yamagata Prefecture,

Hello. It appears I can either take the monorail to Hamamatsucho Station or take the Limo Bus to Shinjuku Station and then transfer to the JR Yamanote Line. In either case can I purchase the ticket just one time at the airport or do I need to purchase again when I arrive to JR Yamanote?  I read on another post that the queues to purchase or exchange anything at the airport have been very long. So I've decided to bring Yen with me from the US.  However depending how I'm feeling when I arrive I may just go ahead and take a taxi since the tour begins the following day. Now I wish I had come in a day or 2 earlier.  Thank you again. ,aquablue,Tokyo,"Orlando, Florida"

We're thinking of spending 2 days in Kanazawa itself & taking a day trip out around the Noto Peninsula. Maybe hire a car.

Hi everyone    Could I just check if it would be worth visiting the Kurobe Gorge (via the railway) in end November? Based on our research so far it seems like the autumn foliage season peaks around late October to mid November so is it likely the case that most of the colours would be gone by the time we visit say around 28 or 29 November?    Understand also that the railway would actually be closed in December onwards.    We initially planned to do the Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine Route during that time but shelved that idea because we read that it might not be the best time to do it (heavy snow possible route closures etc.) So instead we thought maybe to do the Kurobe Gorge/railway instead. But now we are re-thinking this back-up plan to see if we should prioritise spending more time in Kanazawa and surrounding regions instead (any interesting/good daytrip ideas from Kanazawa apart from Shirakawago/Gokayama would be much appreciated too).    Thanks very much!! :) ,danieltan92,Hokuriku,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi everyone    I am a bit confused with the IC cards usage and need help to clarify.    We will arriving at KIX and heading to Kyoto (likely taking the Haruka). After which we will commute internally within Kyoto and possibly 2 day trips to Osaka city (Kyoto is our base Hotel near Kyoto Station).    After that we will head to Tokyo.    We did the math and a JR Pass doesn’t make sense so we will buy an ICOCA card when we land at KIX.    1. But I read (in the JR pass booklet) that for Haruka I need to use IC card (ICOCA) + a limited express ticket.    2. Going from Kyoto to Osaka (Dotonbori for example) can I just use the IC card and board any relevant train going to Osaka?    3. For going to Tokyo from Kyoto we will take the Shinkansen - here again I use IC card or buy a separate Shinkansen ticket (and does it need to be booked in advance or we can just reach the station and buy? This journey will be on a Thursday and we will have 3 cabin luggage pieces.    4. Within Kyoto for buses and local trains we just use the ICOCA right? What’s a bus pass (is it like a saver pass)?    Sorry for so many questions… I have researched a lot but I think the more I read the more I am confused. ,NeverJetLagged,Osaka,"Singapore, Singapore"
Good morning everyone  We are planning our trip to Japan for the first two weeks of November  For me as for everyone the problem is limiting myself in wanting to include too many destinations... however...    There will be 4 of us two 50-year-olds and two 25-year-olds so the first challenge is to please both generations...contemplation of the landscape is ok but also a bit of evening entertainment...the temples are beautiful yes but also the technology.. I think Japan can please everyone but there will be a balance..    After this long introduction (sorry) here are my doubts and questions:    We'll arrive in Narita around 6.30pm how long do you think it will take us to go through security collect suitcases exchange money find our way around transport? Can I also consider changing the JRPass?    Our itinerary at the moment is this:    4 nights in Tokyo (3 full days)  3 nights in Kyoto (2 days and 1 afternoon)  1 night in Miyajima + visit Hiroshima  1 night in Osaka (evening only)  1 night Koyasan    After that from Koyasan we would have 2 nights in Kanazawa and one last day in Tokyo…  We have one day/one night left...I don't know how to use it..    Shall we break the journey from Koyasan to Kanazawa? Where?  Shall we stay one more day in Kanazawa?  Shall we go back to Tokyo a day early?  I had also thought about the Jigokudani park not so much for the macaques but for the nearby village perhaps finding an ryokan with a private onsen... alternatives of this type?  Other suggestions?    I would have liked to see the autumn foliage but the forecast says it will be later in the month even early December...maybe if I go towards the mountains I would have a chance?    And we'd like a special culinary experience the guys are passionate about sushi (I'm a little less so) maybe do a cooking lesson do you have any suggestions?  thanks to those who answer me.. ,Viki L,,Italy

https://www.mobiry.jp/en/  I used mobiry last week for the first time. Here're some note from my experience.  Mobiry is currently working by browser interface only. Once I shut down iPhone Safari I have to log in again. Login can be either one of email address Google and Facebook account. One can purchase the pass in advance and activate it just before the first ride. I bought two passes JR/Hiroden/Ferry Pass and Digital City Pass. I had credit card payment errors a few times for both of two. It seemed to be a network problem between the ticket operator and credit card service.  Passengers show the pass screen of mobile phone to station staff or driver. One pass with multiple passengers (family for example) is possible. ,ETflyer,Hiroshima,"Fukuoka, Japan"
Lover of nature and history. What better place than Japan especially considering how safe it is during a time where the world is a lot less safer than 4 years ago.

Hello. This is my first time in Tokyo and have a few general questions. Is it relatively easy to cross the street.]? Do pedestrians or drivers have the right of way? I've visited Beijing and crossing the street was a nightmare.  Are credit cards readily accepted or is cash preferred?  Do Taxis take credit cards or cash only?  I realize that I should learn some Japanese phrases however is the English language visible on signs or used on public transportation?  What is the weather the end of October? Is a jacket required?  What time is sunrise and sunset currently?  I've never learned the art of eating with chopsticks. Will I look foolish eating with my own fork?  Are masks being worn currently?

Hi everyone  Having decided to visit Kinosaki Onsen I'm now finding that we are priced out of many of the accommodation options still available for when we will be there in early December.  The only option I can see is to book a room without breakfast and dinner. So my question is - will there be reasonable options to buy breakfast and dinner outside of our accommodation? I'm sure the food provided by the ryokans is great. However the onsen experience is much more important to me than the food and I am happy to eat from convenience stores if that's what it takes for me to go to Kinosaki.  I am considering a room only rate at Kinosaki Onsen Hanakouji Saigetsu. I also saw that there is a female only guesthouse (Wakayo).  I assume that the Hanakouji rate includes the onsen access but I know that I'll have to buy the pass separately if I stay at Wakayo.  I'm very confused right now and I'd really appreciate your feedback. Thanks in advance for your help ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi everyone    I am looking for a temple stay in Koyasan that will enable us to go out to the Okunoin cemetery night tour. I know that some temples have curfews. I don't want to make the wrong choice and get locked out!  Ekoin is booked out for the dates that could work for us. So that is leaving the following temples as options for our stay - Saizenin Hojoin Fumonin Sojoin.  I heard that Shojoshin-in was a good option close to the cemetery but it isn't coming up on Booking.com for me (unless it is one that is only written in Japanese and I just can't read it!)  Is going on the night tour compatible with all or some of these options? ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"

I know November is high season but I've never experienced increases like this when travelling in high season before is it normal? One capsule hotel is £50 per night now and £320 in November. Likewise an airbnb I looked at £60pn now - Oct £550pn in November! These are all very basic no frills accom.

First I'd like to thank all those that helped us in planning our September 2023 trip to Japan.    I also wanted to share our experience using the JR Pass to travel from Narita to Tokyo Station:  1. We bought our JR Pass online directly from the JR website so we could reserve our seats for all our train trips (including the Narita Express into Tokyo) before we left the US. It was more expensive than buying from other online retailers but we wanted to have our itinerary set up in advance.  2. Our flight from the US arrived about 8 pm and the last Narita Express train departed the airport at 9:45 pm.  3. We had to pick up our JR Pass at the airport to get the Narita Express train tickets we had reserved in advance.  4. Unfortunately the JR offices close by 7pm except for a small two person location near the Narita Express train tracks.  5. We had no problem getting through customs/immigration quickly but we waited in a long line for an hour to pick up the JR Pass (there was still a long line when we left the ticket office).  6. We did make the last Narita Express train to Tokyo (9:45 pm) but only by a few minutes.    My suggestion: Don't bother to try to use the JR Pass for your Narita Express journey if you are arriving in the evening. You can buy tickets at the online kiosk and bypass the line.    I also wanted to mention that we frequently saw long lines at the JR Rail offices in various train stations so you may want to plan accordingly. ,BackPacker796462,Narita,

I am taking my parents who are in their mid 70s with me on this trip and wanted to get some input. Our base will be in Tenjin [Fukuoka] for 5 days in the last week of Oct.    Im thinking not to get a car instead just use the train system or taxis if not reachable by train. If there is a must see place that is better reached by car I am open to renting one for a day or two    Here are some of the sites that I think are worth visiting and prioritizing in our 5 day trip    Day 1  Ohorio park fukuoka castle Daimyo neighborhood    Day 2  Dazaifu town and Sasaguri town (ie Bronze Buddha) - full day    Day 3 Kumamoto or Nagasaki?    Day 4 and 5 TBD    Canal city tochogi temple Kushida Shrine fukuoka tower Yatal stalls - near the hotel we can do this anytime.    Yanagawa River Cruise - is this worth it?    Raizan Sennyoji in Itoshima? Is it worth the long trip? Are there other things to see and explore in Itoshima other than the temple so we can make this a full day activity?    Not really interested in Onsen since the parents wouldnt really care for it. Feel free to suggest additions or deletions if you can provide your reasoning behind that would be helpful.

My partner and I visited Japan last year during November and went on the typical Osaka > Kyoto > Nara > Hakone > Tokyo trip over roughly 16 days. We're visiting South Korea and Kyushu (and part Honshu) this time round and would love any recommendations.    I also can't work out whether it's worth buying a two-week JR pass (we didn't last time) since we'll be travelling exclusively by public transport. The calculator states that it isn't quite worth it but obviously the calculator doesn't include buses or local transport within cities?    26 Nov Day 1: **Fly in from South Korea to Fukuoka**    We have tickets to the Sumo Tournament finale at the Kokusai Center (hopefully the plane isn't delayed). We'll probably spend the evening at the Christmas Markets and food stalls    27 Nov Day 2: **Fukuoka + Nazoin**    Visit Nazoin and the reclining Buddha in the morning then back to the city to visit the various museums shrines castle canal city etc. Fukuoka TeamLabs Forest    28 Nov: **Fukuoka + Dazaifu**    Day trip to Dazaifu to visit the Kyushu National Museum temples gardens etc. and back to Fukuoka in the evening to finish off anything we haven't seen and go shopping    29 Nov: **Nagasaki**    Entire day in the main city centre. We're staying on I + Land Nagasaki which means slightly increased travel time. Visit all major shrines gardens chinatown etc. in the centre    30 Nov: **Nagasaki**    Go to the north of the city. Visit the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum memorial museum one-legged shrine Peace Park etc. and take the cabal car to Mount Inasa at night to get a view of the city    1 Dec: **Nagasaki**    Probably the entire day in Huis Ten Bosch exploring the park and enjoying the Christmas decorations/activities    2 Dec: **Kumamoto**    No idea. We have to travel here to go on to Mt Aso & Beppu. Maybe just visit the castle and then relax since we're only here overnight    3 Dec: **Mt Aso & Beppu**    Entire day walking around Mt Aso. No real plan here or idea of specific destinations to visit. Finish in Beppu private onsen hotel    4 Dec: **Beppu**    Explore the city. Chilled pace since we're paying for a very expensive private onsen hotel. Visit the Michelin star onsens seven hells steamed food restaurants maybe get buried in hot sand?    5 Dec: **Beppu + Yufuin**    1/3 day in Yufuin to visit the Floral Village and lake. Nothing specific in mind other than shopping. Back to Beppu for the majority of the day    6 Dec: **Hiroshima**    Bit of a rushed day but Flame of Peace Atomic Bomb Dome Hiroshima Castle some museums Shukkeien Garden. A lot of eating.    7 Dec: **Hiroshima + Itsukushima**    1/2 or 2/3 day in Itsukushima.    8 Dec: **(Kobe?) + Osaka**    Briefly stop off in Kobe to try Kobe beef at a good quality restaurant. Nothing booked yet. Not sure what else is in Kobe. On to Osaka to go shopping. We've visited before and seen a few of the major sights but were rushed.    9 Dec: **Osaka**    Currently no plan    10 Dec: **Fly from Osaka back to Seoul** ,Delta,,

Hi !    My husband and I are going to Japan in May 2024. We already booked our plane and our hotels - I am so excited !    I am trying to plan the details and to be as informed as possible. I came across some info that is a bit confusing so I was wondering whether you could answer some of my questions :    TRANSPORT QUESTIONS    - Airport transfer to Shibuya : we will be landing in Narita Airport at 18h35 (provided there isn’t any delay). I am guessing getting our luggage and going through custom will take some time. I am hoping we can still catch the Narita Express and make it to Shibuya. I have read that the alternative is the Keisei Skyliner. I have three questions  - 1) can I buy my ticket at the airport (preferably NOT at a machine as I am scared of getting in wrong) ? Then I don’t have to commit before knowing exactly the time and whether it’s too late or not for the Narita express  - 2) Do I have to switch trains to get to Shibuya if I get the Narita express ? I read some places that we do and others that it is a direct train  - 3) Can I get the Narita express no matter the terminal where I land ? I don’t know where that will be and I saw somewhere you could only take it from terminal 1 ?    - We plan on getting individual tickets (no JR pass) and would like to buy them at the station. Can we go and buy them a few days before departure each time ? By that I mean if we are in Tokyo and want to take a train to Kyoto on Thursday 11/05 can we go to the station on Tuesday 09/05 to buy our tickets for Thursday 11/05 ? If yes can we buy them from any station or does it have to be the specific station we want to depart from ?    - we will be going from Osaka to Hakone spend the night in Hakone and then from Hakone to Shinjuku. We are planning on getting the Hakone Free Pass. From what I understood the best value for us is to get it with the Odawara return trip (and then get a separate ticket to Shinjuku).  - 1) Can we buy the Hakone free pass in Shinjuku even if we don’t get the return ticket to and from Shinjuku ?  - 2) Can we buy the ticket to Shinjuku (preferably the romance car so it’s direct) from Hakone the day of ? Our Ryokan is closest to the Yumoto station so I was wondering if there was staff there or only a vending machine (I read horror stories about the vending machines so I am a tad scared of them haha) ?      SIM CARD    - I saw that Narita airport had vending machines with SIM cards and we were planning on getting one there. However I am scared we won’t have time to look for the vending machines before catching the Narita express. Can we also buy them in the city ? I saw some posts that said you could get them in convenience stores and some others that said it was difficult to find them outside of the airport.      DISNEY    - I saw that you could buy Disney tickets from convenience stores. Would it be fine if we got them around 2 weeks in advance or is there a risk that we’ll be too late and it’s safer to get them online from Klook before we leave for Japan ?      FUJI Q HIGHLAND    - we want to get tickets to Fuji Q Highland together with the highway bus. Is is possible to buy tickets once we are there (to check the weather) or should we book them in advance ? If in advance is the ticket from klook legit and enough ? Is the bus station in Shinjuku easy to find ?        I apologize for all the questions they may be basic or “stupid” but I did a lot of research but read a lot of diverging information that ended up confusing me. I like to be certain of the logistics so that I am not anxious when we are traveling and can make the most of our trip.    Thank you to anyone who will answer !

Would it be better to look at the airport HND or near the monorail station area. I'm only allowed 1 liter and would like to find small bottles 250 ml or so. I have seen the One Shot type at 7-11 but would like a better choice.  Thanks ,bubbler,,
I am torn in booking a tour with a guide because they are really expensive.

While searching information regarding JR trains between Osaka Station and Shin-Osaka Station on Tripadvisor Osaka forum I came across the link below.  http://www.hyperdia.com/en/    However I couldn't get any search results because The arrival station(To) is not found.

Hey all    I have a snowboarding trip from mid-late Feb 2024 that I've planned out already (SFO => NRT => CTS => NRT => SFO) but there's one part of it that's on the return leg (NRT => SFO) in the format of a slightly extended layover that I can't quite figure out the best way to optimize and I figured I might ask for some advice here.    Relevant context:  * Solo travel  * First time in Tokyo  * Luggage: 1 Snowboard bag + 1 checked bag (checked bag is < 20kg)  * Arrival on Peach at 22:10 on Feb 24th Saturday  * Fly out on ZipAir 21:30 on Feb 26th Monday  * Accommodation budget of not more than US$200/night    The flight times are locked in - I was thinking of a short self-guided exploration tour but looking at the distances and travel timings involved I realized it's not that easy.    I don't have strong expectations on what to do - I could just fallback to staying in a hotel Narita for 2 nights and just take the train in the morning given all the luggage I'd need to haul around. Or maybe some hybrid where I stay one night in Narita and one in Tokyo (could I leave luggage at the airport)?    Any ideas would be welcome! I'm flexible on the itinerary given the constraints of the timings. ,Benjamin Goh,Tokyo,San Francisco...
Hi all    I am aware there are issues with chips shortages for these cards but some 'welcome' ones are still available.    We will initially only be in Tokyo for 2 days then head to Hiroshima (I am not using a JR pass as it looks like it is better for us to buy individual tix based on the calculator) but we will be back to Tokyo later via a number of other cities including Osaka. Do you think we should just initially buy transport tickets in Tokyo using some other Tokyo-specific ticket deals for 48 hours and only get the IC cards later on? Or buy the IC cards at the beginning of the trip (we will be in Japan for just under 4 weeks) and use them the entire time topping up as we go? I don't know what is most practical or value for money.    Hope what I'm asking makes sense :-) ,TravelFanAus,,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi everyone    I've spent ages looking for a hotel that's easy to reach from Haneda Airport and not too expensive. My daughter and I will be first time visitors to Japan arriving after 8pm and we want to keep things as simple as possible for our first day or two.    I'm thinking of booking the Shinagawa Prince Hotel because it seems easy to get there on the metro from Haneda. I was also considering the Super Hotel Premier Tokyo Station but the Shinagawa Prince seems closer to the airport.    Is Shinagawa Prince a good option?    I really wanted to stay somewhere more traditionally Japanese like the Edo Sakura or Andon Ryokan but it looks a lot more tricky to get to these places at night. I would prefer not to take a taxi unless I really need to.    I would appreciate some insights from experienced Tokyo travellers. Thanks in advance for your help. ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi everyone    I am in the final stages of organising our itinerary for late November/early December this year. At this point I have Kinosaki Onsen in mind but I've started to wonder if it is worth the travel from the Kyoto/Osaka region or if I can have a similar experience somewhere closer. We will also be visiting Tokyo Takayama Kanazawa and Hiroshima. I have only had a quick look at accommodation options in Kinosaki but most of the prices I have seen so far seem a bit expensive for us (maybe I have missed out on the cheaper options).    We will have rail passes and enough time to go to Kinosaki if we choose to do this. We may also visit Hakone so I am wondering if it's worth visiting 2 onsen towns. Having said that I do love hot springs!    Is anyone able to suggest alternatives to Kinosaki Onsen - or reinforce that it is worth the trip there?    I have seen Gero and Unazaki mentioned on the TA forums. How do they compare with Kinosaki and Hakone?    Thanks in advance for your help! ,Elise,,"Sydney, Australia"

I will be on a group tour in early November. The travel documents provided by the tour company recommend specific amounts to tip the tour manager who is with us for 12 days and any bus driver we have. I always follow these guidelines but I don’t know if I should in Just apan. Everything I have read says there is no tipping in Japan and I don’t want to offend someone by offering a tip. The tour company has not been helpful in clarifying whether in this case the tour manager/bus driver will expect and gratefully receive a tip. Should I ask the tour manager? Any advice? ,honeylaw,Tokyo,Los Angeles...
HI I 've been thinking about this and just not sure which is better:    Should I wait past the peak hour or get a taxi from Hamamatsuchu station?

Hello    I am a first time visitor to Japan ( solo middle aged female traveler) and thought I would post my question to this forum. I will be in Japan for 6 days from Dec 20th-26th . I had planned to stay near Tokyo train station for the first 2 nights and then take the Shinkansen to Kyoto for 3 nights. I will be returning on the 25th to Tokyo and was considering staying in Asakusa as I wasn't sure I would have time to see that part of the city during my first 2 days. I also read that there are good transport links to Narahita Airport from Asakusa ( my flight is on the 26th afternoon) . Is Asakusa a good place to stay given that it will be Christmas Day when I am there? I was planning on staying at the Asakusa Kokono hotel due to it's proximity to Sensoji temple but now understand the there is a club on the ground floor and am not sure how quiet/ safe the area will be? Does the forum have any other recommendations for hotels or other areas of Tokyo to stay in that would still give me hassle free direct ( as much as possible) transfer to Narita? I don't speak Japanese. I'm not really interested in visiting bars or clubs. Thanks in advance ,Looking4Sunshine,Tokyo,Boston...

Hi all    Will be heading to Kyushu for 12 days in December. However I was also given a list of food places that family would like to cover/try.

Will be traveling last 12 days of December which covers Christmas too. Should I avoid anywhere in Christmas? I will be flying in and out via Fukuoka and we will be hiring a car.

Any recommendations on a Food tour in Osaka where a guide can take us thru various specialties of the food capital of Japan :) ,NeverJetLagged,Osaka,"Singapore, Singapore"
I am travelling around Japan on a cruise and Sakata is one of numerous ports. I am going through all the excursions offered by the ship for the various ports of call. They are very expensive so I am being very selective with choices. Many of the tours make a “feature” of including free time or shopping time which I think is a bit of a joke when you are paying a fortune for something that costs them nothing.    The idea of this post is to see places where it is worth exploring on foot around the port area or travel by local transport to places of interest. I prefer this than being part of a large group. Knowing Japan is very punctual with public transport means I can hopefully assure I will be back onboard in time for departure. My only concern will be conversing in English as I don’t speak Japanese. I will endeavour to learn a few phrases before I go.    Other options would be to arrange a local private tour and get some other passengers to share the cost. It would be much nicer travelling with a small group rather than a bus load. It would be great if you have any recommendations.    My husband and I are both 70 and reasonably active so walks are fine. Not strenuous treks or ground being too rocky or rough.    Any suggestions would be most appreciated.    Thanks. Carol. ,Carol D,Sakata,"Perth, Australia"
Hi everyone  We're spending 3-4 nights in Tokyo in late March next year - family of four. We're hoping to stay in an area that's not too busy as the kids find crowds a little overwhelming.

But we also want to be able to get to/from Shinjuku and Tokyo Stations without too much trouble as we will be arriving/leaving from there. Also probably spending a day at Disneyland.    I would be most grateful for any suggestions for neighbourhoods/areas that might fit the bill - and which have a few hotels/Airbnb's.    Thanks very much for any feedback. ,marie_Perth,Tokyo,"Perth, Western..."
Is there some “trick” to taking the photo of the landing sticker to set up tax free shipping without passport?    I’ve tried dozens of times without success.    I don’t know if I’m supposed to take a photo of the entire sticker or only the QR code on the sticker.    Any advice appreciated. ,STLvagabond,,"St. Louis, MO"

Hi all. My wife and I are visiting Japan next month in November for 2 weeks.    We expect Narita airport to be very busy and to wait in line to buy transfer tickets to Shinjuku.    How long is the wait typically in Narita to buy tickets for the NEX to Shinjuku station?    Also can we buy physical tickets in Tokyo for our train ride from Odawara station to Kyoto station?    Thanks in advance. ,Joe_Cruzer,Tokyo,"Toronto, Canada"
Hi everyone..    Traveling to Japan later in October and need some advice on itinerary.    We will have 4 days between Osaka and Kyoto.  We want to give Kyoto more time (say 3 days) and Osaka 1 day (we’ve heard so much about the food in Osaka and very keen to explore).    This is our itinerary:    Day 1:    (land in Osaka Day zero evening)  - Osaka Castle  - Explore Dotonbori area  - Possibly a food trail?    Day 2  Train to Kyoto    - Kiyomizu Dera  - - Ninenzaka and Sannen Zaka  - Yasaka Shrine  - Ishibei Koji St  - Explore Gion area in the evening    Day 3  - Start the day early morning with Fushimi Inari Taisha (or possibly end the day with this to avoid crowds)  - Kinkakuji Temple  - Ginkakuji Temple  - Explore Pontocho area and food in the area    Day 4    - morning: still figuring what we can do here  - Afternoon: train to Tokyo    Anything in this that you suggest we’d rather not do or anything to add/ replace that we must must do?    .Context: We are a couple with a teenager we love culture art museums history and food!    We are in Japan for 7 days (too too too little time than what this place deserves hence very confused how to do this) .. We are slow travelers we like to take our time at a museum or a temple for example without having to rush. We also like to have some time to wander around neighbourhoods without an agenda stumble upon something interesting (food/ art/ local shops/ everyday things). Too ambitious? ,NeverJetLagged,Kyoto,"Singapore, Singapore"
Is Japan a safe place for people with dark skin and beard?  Are people nice there to us? I have had very negative experience with visiting Austria with people dashing away from me in public transport not getting into elevators with me etc. I read that Japan is a very conservative country and that they are treating white-skinned foreigners very good but I am not white skinned. I read that there is high level of racism dark skinned people have a difficult time renting getting employment etc. ,Name N,,

I'm looking at a airport transfer from my Airbnb in Sumida City to Haneda airport because I'm travelling with a 15 months old baby and many luggages. I read the laws and understand that car seats are mandatory except for taxis.    However when I sought a quotation from a reputable airport transfer service and enquired on adding on an infant car seat I was told that it's not mandatory in Japan and that they do not offer this add-on. Is this accurate or is there some language miscomm here? It will likely be a Toyota Hiace so I'm puzzled why it's not mandatory to have a car seat. Or does such airport transfer service count as taxis under the law?    A second quote from another reputable company offered me the option to include an infant car seat and did not mention that it's not mandatory. ,SlateQueen,Tokyo,Singapore

I’m going to make a reservation one month in advance for sunset time for end of November. Sun sets approximately 4:30. So I was thinking of reserving for 3:30. That way I get day light/ golden hour and night time. Should be dark by 5:30. I hear it’s a wait just to get in. How far in advance do I need to show up to start lining up for my reserved time? I don’t want to show up right at my reserved time and not get in till 30 minutes later. Thanks ,Lisa W,Tokyo,Huntington Beach CA

Hi everyone!    Looking for help on a 14-15 days Itinerary for Japan for mid November! I’ve tried doing research and looking into others blogs but my husband and I (34) both agreed we don’t want to move every night or every two nights as a lot show bc I feel like for us it sometimes makes the experience less enjoyable and more rushed.    We will fly in and out if Tokyo and definitely want to spend time both there and Kyoto but we are very open for the inbetween with the caveat of not moving 5 times inbetween for accommodations (day trips are totally fine).

I am doing 20 day cruise of Japan in May/June 2024. It would be nice to have cell phone reception for the trip. Especially when ashore as ship wifi won’t work then.

Hi couple in early 50s first trip to Japan arriving from UK at Haneda 5th November (quite soon !) and flying out of Osaka to Hong Kong on 17th November flights booked plus first 3 nights in Tokyo at JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku. Nothing else booked so far as we were unsure the trip would happen.    After 3 nights in Tokyo we would like to visit:  - Hakone maybe 1 night on the way to Kyoto;  - Kyoto maybe 4 or 5 nights use it as a base for visiting Osaka as well;  - Hiroshima maybe 2 nights.    That still gives us maybe 3 nights spare. What is an easy way for first time visitors to get out into the Japanese countryside and maybe do some hiking get a feel for more rural Japan ? We will travel between cities by train but I am happy to rent a car to get out further and prices from Kyoto seem reasonable.    Will Kyoto be very busy in early November ?

April 2-6 with Nara as a base visit Koriyama Tsubosakadera Hase-dera and Ono-ji in that order (based solely on the idea that being south and higher elevation they will bloom in that order????).    Or  Would it be better to split this part of the trip?  April 2 -Nara Park.  Return perhaps 7-8th to visit the prefectural sites as above.

Our trip to Tokyo is coming up! I'm seeing a lot of different advise about money exchange and best way to do so. To clarify we will be coming from US and will either have a Chase Debit card linked to checking and Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card as plans for primary use.    So questions:  1) I hear people say just take money out of 7-11 ATMs when needed with a pin. Are they saying take it out with in my instance the Chase checking account? Isn't there an ATM fee or international use fee each time I take it out with this? For our last UK trip that was $5 per pop on getting new cash from ATMs. The Chase Visa is international fee free for purchase but if I use that one wouldn't ATM withdraw be a cash advance at a higher interest rate?    2) Should we bring say $500 USD to exchange when we land in HND airport? We don't land till 6:30PM so is there a chance they run out of currency for exchange so late in the day and we should plan to exchange money before we get out there? Can any banks in Tokyo do the exchange or are exchange rates here?    3) The Suica apple wallet app I read that they normally only take AMX or Master Card for reload. Oddly we have several Visas but no Master Card...is there a way around this funding or should I open up a master card before our trip if there is still Suica card shortages?    Thanks and would appreciate any other tips. This is the only thing I'm still trying to figure out before our trip! ,Chartreuse,Tokyo,
Hello    My family and I are travelling to Tomamu in January. Last year we stayed at Tower Hoshino and my daughter (then 4 years old now 5) had her first snowboarding lessons. This year we are staying at Club Med Tomamu where they have told me that children below 8 years old do not snowboard and there are no lessons (which was supposed to be included in the price). Is this correct?    If it is correct would you know whether there are any other options other than going back to Tower Hoshino to hire her board and do the lessons there?    Thanks ,we_dont_do_suntans,Hokkaido,"Singapore, Singapore"
I will arrive at Tokyo Haneda on a Monday night at 8pm local time. Is it reasonable to assume I’ll be able to buy a pocket wifi at the airport at that hour of the night? If not can you recommend one I can buy in advance? Will I also need a local SIM card for my iPhone?    I’m staying in Shibuya in an air BnB - can you give me tips on finding my accommodation?

Hi everyone    I know that you can take the subway to the airport.

We (my husband and myself) will be taking our first trip to Japan in November/2024. We have about 3 weeks to work with. Thanks to all of you I have come up with a rough itinerary. Of course I started with a long wish list but after reading the forum I have narrowed it down quite a bit there's always visit #2!    What we're missing besides some time in nature is a traditional Ryokan Stay. We would like a private onsen preferably outdoors. A vacation from our vacation type of thing. I would love to hear your suggestions of places and where to fit it in our itinerary. We would love 2 nights. We've looked at Beniya Mukayu (I like the area) but since we'll be in Kyusha I also looked at Kurokawa.    Any advice on our 1st visit itinerary would be welcome! We are mid 60's and very active. Places we've crossed off are the Takayama/Kamikochi area and Hakone.    Tokyo 3 nights  Kyoto 5 nights (day trip to Nara)  Mt Koya (1 night or 2)  Mijama 2 nights (stopping in Hiroshima not sure if Himeji is on the way or not)  Fukuoka (to see the Sumo Wrestling)  ** working on this part **  Kanazawa 3 nights  Back to Tokyo    Thank you! ,Kathy H,,Paso Robles...

Hi everyone..    Traveling to Japan later in October (2 adults and a teenager) and a bit confused on one piece of our internal travel:    - we will arrive at Narita 8 am (after an overnight flight Singapore to Narita with layover at Ho Chi Minh City so am guessing we will not exactly be fresh as a flower)  - Our plan is to head straight to Osaka (stay there 3 days days head to Kyoto 2 days)  - Then head back to Tokyo 3 days and fly out of Narita again    My question is for our arrival. On arrival at Narita if we plan to head straight to Osaka - it seems like a laborious journey with our luggage after an overnight flight (Narita to Shinagawa Shinagawa to Shin Osaka and then local train to wherever our hotel is (likely Mody Honmachi or Mitsui Garden Kita) …    Is it better we fly from Narita to Kansai or Itami?

Hi !  We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 12 and 16 years old kids). After being in Europe 7 or 8 times we are looking for another experience. Japan is on the top of our list. The thing is that we must travel only in summer (we are teachers and the kids are in school). The earliest we can go is july 3. We would go for 3-4 weeks and we are from Montréal.  We know that July isnt the best time to in Japan beacause of the heat and humidity. So we have two options: Go anyways and try to manage the heat or wait until we are retired (and maybe dead before !) .

Then I get dropped at narita airport and wait for an hotel shuttle from that airport! Such a convoluted way! A taxi or private transfer is @$400 Australian dollars.

Hello fellow travelers  I am taking my parents who are in their late 70s with me on this trip and wanted to get some input. Our base will be in Tenjin Fukuoka for 5 days.  1. I decided not to get a car instead just use the train system or taxis if not reachable by train.  2. Here are some of the sites that I think are worth visiting and prioritizing in our 5 day trip  Ohorio park fukuoka castle - half day  canal city tochogi temple fukuoka tower Yatal stalls - near the hotel we can do this anytime  Dazaifu town and Sasaguri town (ie Bronze Buddha) - full day  3. Is Kumamoto worth visiting for an entire day?  4. Would you choose Kumamoto or Nagasaki or both if you had the time?  5. Yanagawa River Cruise - is this worth it?

Normally I would head out to Hakone or Kawaguchiko but I can’t justify it with only 3 nights and an early AM flight out of Haneda on day 4.    Any suggestions? Cost is not a factor. Thank you. ,Wanderlustseadragon,,"New York City, New..."
We are travelling to Japan very soon. I have been looking at how to get from Odawara Station to our hotel Ichinoyu Honkan . I have read one option is to get the Tozan train to Tonosawa Station and then walk to the main road 5 mins. I can see the route on google maps and it seems to go through a wooded area. Has any one walked this route and is it ok and lit ? I always like to walk a route I am taking on google maps but I can only see a satellite view and wondered what the walk was like. Many thanks ,Clive Baker,Hakone-machi,

I need to purchase non-pass tickets and have a few questions since the last time I was in Japan I only purchased a R/T Tokyo-Kyoto ticket and did that through a third-party vendor. For this trip I plan to take the following trains departing ~10-11am:  * Tokyo (Shinjuku JR Station Azusa train) to Matsumoto (10/15)  * Matsumoto(Shinano) to Kanazawa (10/17)  * Kanazawa (Thunderbird) to Kyoto (10/21)  * Kyoto to Tokyo (Nozomi) (10/28)    My questions include:  1. How far in advance do I need to purchase? I will arrive in Tokyo the evening of 10/13 and will take the first trip to Matsumoto on 10/15. I was planning to purchase it on 10/14 at a JR station and other trips the day before my planned trip.    2. Is it recommended to purchase a reserved seat vs. non-reserved? I wasn't sure given the times I am taking.    3. There is a 7 minute connection at Nagano on the Matsumoto to Kanazawa leg. Is this enough time or shall I allow 50 min? I’ll be on the Shinano 5 and transferring to Hakutaka. I have looked at the Nagano station map and see that the Shinano is on 1F but can’t tell with the Hakutaka.    4. I also plan to do a day trip to Osaka from Kyoto and should be able to use my Suica for that correct? ,Jennifer B,,United States

Hi    My wife and I shall be travelling to Japan with my parents who are 70-77 years old cannot walk long distances or ascend steps because of knee/back issues. My wife and I shall be taking them around in wheelchairs. My father also has a pacemaker though that does not affect his travelling. This is their 50th Wedding Anniversary year and this trip is for them.    They have never been to Japan and are interested in fall foliage and want to experience Tokyo. I am just listing logistics below.    23rd Oct – Arrive Sapporo in evening via Haneda. Stay at Air Terminal Hotel at Chitose.  24th Oct – Transfer to Jozankei View Hotel by Minivan (with sightseeing enroute and at Jozankei if possible before reaching hotel)  25th Oct – Transfer by Hotel’s Free Shuttle to Sapporo Station and then take two normal taxis to Mercure Sapporo. Rest of the day free for local sightseeing at Sapporo using Taxis.  26th & 27th Oct – Day trips from Sapporo using Minivan  28th Oct – Take late morning flight to Tokyo  29th-31st Oct – Tokyo and surrounding areas  1st Nov – Depart Japan by Morning Flight    The sightseeing needs to be very slow paced because of their restricted mobility. We intend to use private transportation in spite of extremely high costs. While in Hokkaido they are primarily interested in visiting scenic places and more particularly fall foliage wherever possible. I see that the first forecast has been published:    https://s.n-kishou.co.jp/w/sp/koyo/koyo_yosou_spot.html?&ba=01    I am unclear from the web which places they can visit which are wheelchair accessible (or require minimum walking on flat surface). Unfortunately they cannot do steps or slopes.    Can you please advise me:    1. Can you please suggest a few places we can do on 24th Oct (could mean going slightly off the route from CTS to Jozankei?  2. Which places in Sapporo City should we consider?  3. Which places should we consider for day trips on 26th/27th Oct? Research gave me some names for one of the day trips (don’t know which is more relevant) Ashiyama Zoo Blue Pond Shirahige Falls Ningle Terrace Aoiike Farm Tomita….. Biei/Furano….

Hello  I'm planning my next visit in Japan and was wondering if I can get discounted tickets for Haruka train?    My trip starts at Tokyo Haneda airport where I'm planning to get either Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport to get around Tokyo. After a week I'm going to Kyoto and staying there until my trip back from Japan via Osaka Kansai airport.    Is it neccessary for me to get ICOCA card to buy discounted tickets for Haruka train from Kyoto or can I just use my tourist-edition SUICA/PASMO card since they are usable in Kyoto/Osaka region too? ,Adam,Kyoto,"Gdansk, Poland"

こんにちわみんなさん  Hello everyone  I would like to book some accommodation on Jalan.net and notice that some of the accommodation charges a cancellation fee which varies depending on the duration between the cancellation and the intended check-in date.    I also noticed the bookings didn't need my credit card details.    I am curious to know if I cancel my booking how will the cancellation fee be sorted? Will Jalan send me an email with a bill with payment instructions?    Please let me know your experience.    Thanks in advance.    Cheers  Herolimo ,herolimo,,

I hope to visit the Narita-san Temple coming from Narita Airport. It looks like there are multiple train options and I'm not sure if one or the other is easier/better. Can someone advise:    1) Is Keisei or JR is better - or no difference?    2) Can I use my IC card without needing any type of supplemental ticket to pay the fare from Narita Airport? (on local lines avoiding limited express trains)    3) Looking at Narita maps it looks like both Terminal 1 and 2 have access to the JR and Keisei departures. Is access about the same or easier from Terminal 1 or 2?    4) Is taxi a reasonable option or would a taxi driver object to the reasonably short trip?

The new online process for importing medications for Japan travel is quite confusing. I believe I have everything squared away but need to confirm what I see. In the FAQ there is an entry for what documents you need to attach. and for my classification of application it states.    ・You are required to attach at least the following documents to file an application.  Import for personal use:  Invoice and Delivery Ticket  Prescription or Direction etc. by Doctor  Statement of Reasons (when the imported product is delivered to any place other than your home)    Is the invoice and delivery ticket my receipt from the pharmacy?    I assume the prescription or direction is just a copy of the prescription from the doctor?    Statement of reason would be for my travels there? Or is this why I need the medications?

My mom and I are going to Japan in a little under two weeks for 10 days and other than our first couple of days in Tokyo I have no idea where to go. This is our second time in Japan I was able to land a free trip with my Capital One miles but I have had little luck getting any semblance of an itinerary together. We have already been to Kyoto and Osaka so don't really need to see those again. I am into history anime Japanese culture etc. We're not outdoor folks so no nature hikes or anything. My mom also has two bad knees.    I've seen some itineraries online mentioning Kurobe Gorge Nagoya and Kanazawa but I'm kind of lost so any suggestions are welcome.

I am very confused by the Nikko bus pass options. I would like to visit on a single day trip from Tokyo and see the Kirifuri Falls and the Nikko Toshogu.    I see that there is a 600 yen one-day bus pass just covering the shrine and then a 1500 yen two-day bus pass ticket that the app says is for Kirifuri Falls and Kirfuri highlands. If I buy the 1500 yen ticket (do I need to buy the two-day pass?) that means I can't use the buses from the station to the shrine with the pass?    I also looked on Google Maps and it appears there's only a bus every two hours from the Kirifuri waterfall parking lot back to the town center? Is that true? How often does it actually depart on weekdays in October?    Thanks! ,travelwiz13,,United States

We're planning to see the Midosuji Illumination this year and then make some dinner reservations. I'm currently working out what to do first.  Is it correct that the illuminations run along Midosuji Avenue between Shinsaibashi Station and Yodoyabashi Station? Or is it bigger than this? I'm happy if this is just the main area of illuminations and for us to see this stretch.  Yodoyabashi Station is in the vicinity of my dinner reservation.

Thank you so much to everyone for your help!  Apologies if this is a silly question - we have limited experience with the snow and cold climates.  In the first week of January we will be spending a few days at a resort in central Hokkaido. There is the option that we can rent a ski jacket and ski pants while we are there for Y10000 total each person. We can't ski or snow board but we will do activities like snowmobile snow shoe cross country ski sledding etc. I think the ski pants will be very useful. I'm not sure about the ski jacket. We have down jackets.  For the activities we have planned are down jackets sufficient or would it definitely be worthwhile renting a ski jacket and using that instead?  Thank you ,Renee1901,Hokkaido,

Hi    My wife and I shall be travelling to Japan with my elderly parents on a 10-day trip during last week of October. We’ll move them around in their wheelchairs as they cannot walk distances. Because of their mobility issues we have just kept the trip restricted to Sapporo & Tokyo.  We shall be holding JR Tokyo Wide Pass and shall do a day trip to Kawaguchiko.  Though it may sound unusual I would also like my parents to experience Shinkansen albeit for short return rides (30-60 minutes each way maybe) to any Shinkansen station without really visiting anywhere (Nikko is not an option because the shrine involves stairs).

Hi! We have digital Suica cards set up for our trip later this month - I see that not just the metros but many of the trains accept these cards. First how do we know whether our train ride is covered (for example Tokyo to Nikko) and then how do we pay for these longer rides with the card? I think for the metro you just swipe it at the entrance and exit but for a train do you have to purchase a ticket at the machine and you can just use your Suica for payment there if you wish? Or is it still a swipe at the exit situation for these longer routes? ,bjamie326,,"Redmond, WA"

Hi everyone  We have rather impulsively booked a short trip to Japan for late March/early April next year - we have 11 nights arriving and departing Tokyo. We're travelling with our two older kids and have been to Tokyo Osaka Kyoto and Nikko previously.    This is my current thinking:  Arrive Haneda in morning - head straight to Hakone for first night.  Return to Tokyo late day 2 then 3 nights in Tokyo - including Disnryland or DisneySea.  Day 5 - to Matsumoto mainly for the castle.  Day 6 - to Takayama for 3 nights. If weather is good go to Shinhotaka Ropeway for a day trip.  Day 9 - to Kanazawa for two nights.  Day 10 - return to Tokyo for a morning flight the next day.    Does this seem a logical route? It has some 1- and 2-night stays that I usually avoid but it does let ys visit some places we are keen to see.    And if we're lucky with timing there could be cherry blossoms. Does this itinerary give us opportunities to see some nice cherry blossom spots? We're not going for the cherry blossoms but would love to see them if they are blooming.

Hi all this is our first trip to Hokkaido.  6 of us including two 70yo elderly and 2 big kids.  Plan to take domestic flight from Tokyo in out Hokkaido and driving in Hokkaido to minimise walking for the elderly.    I am late in my planning and I appreciate if anyone can help.    May I know which area I should focus on (or skip) for this low period that we are going?    There are Ropeways in many places which one cannot miss if I only want to go one?

Wondering how noisy the rooms are from other guests? I read a couple reviews about noise.    For my flight to the U.S it says can reach the airport only 1 hour before? Is that too short?    Last question.. is it easy to exchange money at Terminal 3 for good rates?    Thank you ,Dan T,,
Hello all. We will be picking up our car at Nippon rent a car in Chitose and then heading to Otaru. I have looked at Google maps and see a few routes. Is there a better route?

Hello    My husband and I will be traveling to Hokkaido for 9 days from 10/21 to 10/29. We are hoping to see fall colors soak in onsens and do some hikes.

I would appreciate any suggestions you might have. Couple questions:    1. Is this a realistic itinerary or too rush especially day 3?  2. Any places that we should visit or remove?    Day 1 - Pick up rental car from CTS and head to Sounkyo stay in Sounkyo  Day 2 - Sounkyo  Day 3 - Sounkyo - Chubetsubashi Bridge - Biei - Furano - Jozankei. Stay in Jozankei  Day 4 - Jozanki to Lake Toya. Stay in Lake Toya  Day 5 - Lake Toya to Noboribetsu. Stay in Noboribetsu.  Day 6 - Noboribetsu to Lake Shikotsu. Stay in Lake Shikotsu.

Hi    I just booked an international flight with connection from EVA airline to United at KIX (Taiwan to Osaka to USA). Both legs are booked together on the same ticket and the layover is 2 hour. Do you know if I will need to go through security check again at the airport for this connection? Layover time is not short but if I need to spend time for security check I might just spend more to book a direct flight. I'm pretty sure both airlines use Terminal 1 so maybe no re-screening required? A speedy response is appreciated as I have only a small window to cancel my booking. Thank you! ,Jeff C,Osaka,Walnut Creek...

Just wanted to say thank you for all the helpful advice I was given. I just got back from our stopover visit in Tokyo Disneyland Resort and had a great time. I can't wait to visit more of Tokyo hopefully next year.    A few points:    It was brutally hot - I would never visit in September again it was way too hot for my kids to wait in lines at Disneyland.    I got a pocket wifi delivered to our hotel from Japan Wireless and it worked a treat and I was happy with the price I simply dropped it into the post box before security at the airport when we left.    I used Tokyo Airporter from the airport to our Disney Resort hotel they were great our driver was lovely and waiting for us and helped with all the luggage the car was immaculate highly recommend.    I used the Limousine Bus for the return journey which was great also would recommend.    First night we stayed at the Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay - at over AU$600 a night it was overpriced the pool was closed and even when open you have to pay to use which I find absurd. I wouldn't stay there again.    For our other 4 nights we stayed at the Toy Story Hotel and it was fabulous it was around AU$300 a night and perfect for our family - we are a Disney Family so it was right up our ally. I enjoyed the happy entry and the food options at the hotel in the little store were great.  I did not enjoy the beds they were rock hard and I may as well have been sleeping on the floor - they messed up my back really badly - this is my only complaint about this hotel.    I found the people we encountered to be amazing so friendly and helpful - I can't speak any Japanese but found most people we came across knew some English or understood what we were trying to say and vice versa. I did have to use Google Translate once at the hotel about a check out question and that worked well.    I can't wait to come back to your lovely country. ,galaga_girl,Tokyo,"Bermagui, Australia"

Hi I'm wondering if it's possible for me to split my payment between Suica and credit cards at convenience stores if I run out of my Suica balance. Specifically I'm wondering if anybody has this kind of experience at 7-11 or FamilyMart at Narita Airport. Basically I want to use up my balance for Welcome Suica before leaving so I'm considering buying something more than my Suica balance and then use credit card to pay the remainder. Thanks! ,Tom,Tokyo,
Our cruise ship will be arriving at the Osanbachi Yokomhama International Passenger Terminal and our plane from HND-T3 will be departing around 16:30. It looks as though we can either take the airport shuttle bus from the New Prefectural Office or the Minatomirai Line Wakoshi Express from the Nihon-Odori station to Yokohama station then the Keikyu Airport Line to HND-T3. Is there a danger of either (the bus or the train) being sold out? If so which is more likely to be sold out? Can seats be reserved on either the bus or the trains? Also is Google Maps correct in stating the walk to either the New Prefectural Office or the Nihon-Odori station is 700 meters? We have both the PASMO and Suica apps installed in our phones and I think someone will show us how to use it before we get on the cruise.  Our hotel before the cruise is attached to the Shinagawa station and it looks like it's the Keikyu Main Line followed by the Minatomirai Line for the way over as well changing in Yokohama main station. ,lebelgo,Yokohama,Los Angeles...

Planning out the train travel for my trip leaving in a few weeks. Realizing the JR Pass doesn't cover the Nozomi shinkansen. That being said I am extremely confused about the alternate option to leave from Hiroshima to Kyoto. I have read Kyoto Station and Hiroshima Station are connected by the Tokaido and Sanyo shinkansen lines. Then the further I read it states  With Hikari or Sakura services you may have to make a transfer at Shin-Osaka Station or Shin-Kobe Station. My question is what is the difference between Tokaido Sanyo Hikari & Sakura? How do I know which to take? Appreciate any assistance offered. ,tamee m,,
We are trying to get the best travel plan a for a days journey would really appreciate your help.

Then take subway to Shinjuku station and visit Omide Yokocho area and grab a bite. Wander around east side and visit 2nd floor of Starbucks grab a coffee and get a shot of the Shibuya crossing. After this we will take the subway back to Asakusa. Is the order I have listed the best choice or would it be better in reverse? ,Alphatravelots,Tokyo,"Ottawa, Canada"
Hi all    My family will be travelling to Fukuoka on 28 Dec-8 Jan. Our last trip to Japan was in Jan 2020 and we enjoyed the New Year atmosphere thus decided to travel again over New Year.

Will travel elsewhere if it is snowing. Any suggestions?)  Day 6&7 - Drive to Nagasaki for 2N. Will it be easy to take the ferry with car over New Year period?  Day 8&9 - Drive to Huis Ten Bosch with detour to Arita Porcelain Park  Day 10&11 - Back in Fukuoka ,LizzyHo,Kyushu,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hello guys    I'll be in Tokyo for a meeting in late Nov and I love nature hiking and most importantly I am a traveller that HATE the sights of tourists and noise. I like quiet atmosphere and serene beauty like lakes mountains and seas. I am planning a trip to Wakkanai with the possibility of exploring Rishiri and Rebun as well. I m planning a Haneda-Wakkanai flight end of Nov and then ferry to the islands the next day Will rent a car to explore. Can anyone answer my following questions    1. Is the weather ideal for hiking during late autumn?  2. Where should I stay in Wakkanai or the Rishiri /Rebun island?  3. How many days sufficient for a decent hike?  4. How reliable are the ferry like departure and arrival during off-peak season?    Thanks! ,Raymond H,Hokkaido,Malaysia
We are a couple in our 60s and we plan to visit Osaka in February. I have been looking at some Airbnb options in the Namba area and I noticed that they are very convenient for walking around. The budget is slightly cheaper than a hotel (I think it's because they are close to downtown Osaka that's what I assume). Could you please provide some advice on the pros and cons of staying at an Airbnb instead of a hotel?  Thank you in advance ,calvin,Osaka,Saint Louis...
Hi I will be travelling to Fukuoka in early Dec and may I seek some advice on how should I plan my itinerary for 7 days visit in Kyushu and should I use Fukuoka as based since I hv purchased a 5-day JR Northern Kyushu pass.

Hello I can see so many great sim card and pocket wifi options from online stores like Klook which have pick up locations in Nairita Haneda and KIX etc but we are arriving in Fukuoka. We are spending one night in a hotel in Fukuoka in Decemebr before staying in an AirBnB in Hiroshima. Is deleivery option to hotel in Japan generally reliable?    For one adult and two kids aged 15 and 16 we all have relatively new Samsung galaxy and Google Pixel 7 Pro phones what would be best option for our 21 days in Japan:  (a) Sim card  (b) e-sim  (c) pocket wifi  (d) other option    We would use mainly for google research Whatsapp communication and checking emails etc. I have a romaing plan that lets me make calls and have 10MB data per day while overseas. Kids have no plan at all. I dn't think worth getting phone plans and just data and we can always use whatsapp? Any suggestions/insights welcome. ,The_Vedas,,"Sydney, Australia"

I plan on traveling to Japan Dec26th-Jan8th and I purchased a JR pass from Klook before it the price spikes in a few days. Before I had locked in my purchase I chatted with a rep regarding the 90 day expire after issuing a voucher and they assured me that I wouldn't have to worry because they would issue it 70 days before my trip. Well i purchased it and they issued it the next day Sept 28th. So i contacted them back and they basically told me there was nothing they can do and that i will be fine because it it epires the same day i plan on exchanging it. I already took their word once and it failed whos to say it wont happen again.    So it looks like its going to be cutting it pretty close to expiring if it doesn't expire on the day. I ordered for Dec26th but flight gets in at 8pm and i don't know if ill make it to exchange at the airport so it would have to be next day the 27th..... The day it says it expires. Normally would it still be redeemable the same day it expires? ,Nathan H,,
I will stay a few nights in Hakuba Goryu the week before Christmas. The hotel does provide pick-up to and fro from Kamishiro station.  I plan to ski in Goryu Limori and Happo-One resorts some night photography on the lighted streets with shops on both sides of the street maybe going Hakuba station to get some grocery or laundry service.  We're a family of 4 adults coming from Nagoya and going Mt Fuji afterward. The without car option is a trains combination to Hakuba train to Kofu rent a car the next day to Mt Fuji. This option will limit our mobility in Hakuba but save some money. Read that the Hakuba shuttle bus service is 30min interval need to compete for the seats and take times to travel from one place to another place.  Do I need a car? Maybe can squeeze in a day trip to Togakushi 戸隠 if it snows or if Hakuba doesn't snow.  Also where can I find lighted streets with shops on both sides of the street in Hakuba? ,Hao3Ren2,Chubu,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi there  I have traveled to Japan many times but this time have a limited budget. I am travelling with friends who are on a strict budget of ¥20000 a night or less.  But I need a hotel close to a station - hopefully less than 300- 200 meters with not a lot of steps or hopefully near a lift- I have some limitations with my mobility but I’m independent just have issues with stairs - yes I know Japan is stairway to everywhere.  I’m not looking for trendy or cool just safe (I will be going out myself at times) and a nice neighbourhood. Hopefully on the Yamanote JR line or Metro near a connecting station but not the final factor.  Recommendations very welcome.

Then depart around 12:30 PM and catch the train to Osaka.    I know it's pretty crazy to ask What to do in Nara Park in 3 hours but since this is my first trip (I'm sure to visit again in my lifetime) I figured I want to at least hit all the tourist trap attractions. Currently I am hoping to see these 3: Todai-ji Isuien Garden and Kasuga Taisha. And hopefully a deer or two in-between.    My question is: what are other major must-see things at Nara Park?

I start on Odeo line to ueno- okachimachi station  walk 1 minute to ueno -hirokoji station (1st question is Do I actually leave one station and enter a different station? )  Then from ueno hirokoji station ginza line I go one stop to Ueno station then it says walk 8 minutes to get to Ueno station blue line Hokuriku Shinkansen asama my 2nd question is the 8 minutes I walk is this in the same station or do I actually exit one station to enter another station or is the 8 minute walk purely within the Ueno station to a completely different line/area. I know this may seem stupid but sometimes these directions are confusing and I don’t want to get lost in a huge station fumbling around with large suitcase. Hope someone might be able to help thank you ,missyperu,Tokyo,queensland

We have purchased the 7d JR vouchers and will arrive Narita Terminal 1 at 6:15am flight.  In Narita we then switch vouchers in tickets to begin our travel from Narita to Hiroshima the same day.    JR East Travel Service Center opens at 8:15am  Ticket Office opens 6:30am-8:15am  Narita International Airport Terminal 1 Travel Center opens 9am    Is it possible to redeem vouchers for tickets in the Ticket Office? ,Babette_Cam,,"Ontario, Canada"

Hello  We are taking a day-trip to Nara from Kyoto and want to head to Osaka after. We would like to store our luggages while we sightsee in Nara and before heading to Osaka. We have read that it is better to arrive to Kintetsu-Nara Station as it is closest to some of the sights we want to see. Is there luggage storage at that train station? Or should we arrive at JR Nara in order to store luggage? Thank you! ,Maria P,Nara,"Pasadena, California"
There is not much of information available on the options to climb Mt Fuji from the sea level (vs the popular option from the 5th station) - and wonder if anyone has any advice to share on how best to do this - Tagonoura Port Park or Fujizuka or something else. I'd hope to try as much as possible to enjoy some quieter (hopefully) moments before reaching 5th station during the climbing season! ,500rocks,Fuji,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi. I will visit Tokyo in early November. I plan to visit Mt Fuji area (Kawaguchigo) by taking afternoon train from Tokyo (after 6 pm) and return to Tokyo by afrernoon train (after 6 pm) the day after. I’ll spend 1 night there. My questions are:    1. Should I booked the train ticket in advance? It is noted that I have to take JR Chuo Line and Fuji Kyuko Line.      2. What sightseeing object should I visit around Mt Fuji/Kawaguchigo?    Thank you. ,sat1974,,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Hello  Using the JR calculator it is sayin a close call for the 21 day pass. Given I'm not factoring in local trains and buses(not sure how much I can use with JR pass) do you think it is worth buying JR 21 day pass for convenience and value? Especially before prices go up?    We arrive in Fukuoka on 22 Dec and depart from Henada airport on 11 January.    Also please note I have put Sendau in as it weas closest to place we are actualy going i.e. Morioka for ski resort at Shizukuish. For some reason Morioka is not on JR Calculator but as greater distance from Tokyo than Sendai I think individual ticket price would be greater than Sendai?  thanks      Fukuoka → Hiroshima  8500-9000 yen  Hiroshima → Miyajima  600 yen  Miyajima → Hiroshima  600 yen  Hiroshima → Kyoto  10500-11000 yen  Kyoto → Osaka  500 yen  Osaka → Kyoto  500 yen  Kyoto → Tokyo  13000-13500 yen  Tokyo → Hakone  1500-3500 yen  Hakone → Tokyo  1500-3500 yen  Tokyo → Sendai  10500-11000 yen  Sendai → Tokyo  10500-11000 yen    Tokyo  → Hanada Airport  select...    one way    Total  58200-64700 yen ,The_Vedas,,"Sydney, Australia"

Hello.  I got an ICOCA CARD when arrived at Osaka. Now in Tokyo. Will be ending the trip at Narita.    What are my options to finish/refund the unused balance? We are family - so have 4 ICOCA cards. ,travel_love,,"London, United..."
Hello.  I will be visiting Hokkaido with friends this winter (late January) for a week of guided backcountry skiing. We will be based out of Sapporo and Asahikawa with day trips to various skiing locations (TBD by the guide) followed by onsen and dinners (also TBD by the guide). We will have two full days after the week of skiing to fill with other tourism. Should this also be spent on Hokkaido or should we adjust the local Sapporo-Tokyo flight to spend the last two days on Honshu? While I would love to spend some time in and around Tokyo we will also be traveling with a bunch of ski gear so navigating public transit and busy cities will not be as easy. After a week on Hokkaido as described above are there any additional Hokkaido recommendations for winter tourists that would really add to the visit? Wide open to options that are NOT skiing focused.    Thanks for your time. ,Hazenhart,Hokkaido,"South Jordan, Utah"
I am not sure yet which hotel we'll be staying at but I'm thinking of making a reservation for a hotel with the first night's stay being with three people and the second and third nights' stay being with two people. Suppose the room type is the same so that the only difference between the nights would be the number of people staying. I'm pretty sure that I'd have to make separate bookings: 1) one stay for the first night with three people 2) one stay for the second and third nights with two people. (Of course I could book a stay for three nights with three people but this would likely be more expensive.) If I did the separate bookings since the room type is the same would hotels typically allow us to stay in the same room without having to leave during the time between check-out and check-in?    Is there any provision in the Hotel Business Act or other laws that deal with this? I'll also try to scour through the terms of accommodation for the hotel I attempt to book. (I'm guessing that this would be up to the hotel's discretion regarding whether to let us stay through the interval between the two reservations so I'll call them.)    Thank you in advance. ,Naoya O,,Rolling Hills...

Hello TA    Looking for restaurant recommendations to enjoy some good quality Wagu BBQ that we can cook ourselves. I cannot make an entire meal out of it so we just want to try a bit of top quality beef.    I much prefer Ginza Shiodome Shimbashi area but my hotel is Hilton Shinjuku so around there is second option. ,travelpro69,Tokyo,"San Jose, California"
Hi! As indicated in my title I would like to check if it is possible to walk through the forest from shogunzuka down to Kiyomizudera and if so is the path well marked/ easy to follow?  What I’ve been able to find online are directions from chion temple and back down. Is this an easy walk? Some websites say it’s easy and some say it’s pretty steep!  Unsure if I should take a taxi to shogunzuka then walk to Kiyomizudera (if possible) or just walk the whole route from choin/Maruyama. Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ,eggmajestic,Kyoto,
My husband son and I will be in Japan for 2.5 weeks - arriving December 17 and leaving January 3. Our hotels are booked so we're not looking to change our itinerary. We plan to take the following trains which I think are all be covered by a JR Pass (but I could be wrong):    December 17 - JR Haruka Limited Express from Haneda to Kyoto    December 18-22 - Various trips on JR Nara JR Kyoto and JR Sagano lines    December 23 - Tokaido Shinkansen (Hikari) from Kyoto to Tokyo    December 24-26 - Various trips in/around Tokyo (based in Shinjuku)    December 27 - Hokuriku Shinkansen (Kagayaki Hakutaka or Asama) from Tokyo to Nagano    December 29 - Hokuriku Shinkansen (Kagayaki Hakutaka or Asama) from Nagano to Tokyo    December 30 - January 2 - Various trip in/around Tokyo (based in Ueno)    January 3 - Monorail to Haneda    Would it be worth buying 21-day JR Passes before the price goes up on October 1 - mainly for ease of getting around being able to reserve seats ahead of time etc.? Or should we wait and buy individual train tickets (preferably reserved seats) one month before each travel day? The latter approach seems more complicated but would likely save us money. We're okay with spending a bit more money if the JR Passes will make our travel days easier to navigate (especially around the busy New Year's holiday).    Last question: If we bought JR Passes before October 1 would we have three months to activate them ... or has that time be shortened to one month? I've seen conflicting information online.    Thanks in advance for any guidance you all can provide!! ,gold2929,,Washington
My understanding is that japanrailpass.net is the best site to purchase tickets since you can make reservations through the site. However I cannot purchase tickets until 30 days before my travel date per the sites rules. However I want to buy now to lock in the price. Any other options? Or just be patient and wait? ,AllisonBurgers,,Los Angeles...

Hi everyone    I'll be going to japan during mid November and I'm a bit confused about the reserved seats on the Shinkansen while using the JR Pass and would appreciate some clarification:    My itinerary will basically be on the Tohoku Yamagata and Akita Shinkansen all of which I believe are reserved seats only (Tsubasa and Komachi I believe).    I cannot understand if the seats are meant to be reserved within days in advance or if it is possible to reserve a seat in a machine on the same day the station or even a few hours before boarding.    From what I've it appears to me that the reserved seat is just a guaranty of seated place and not a boarding card onto the train.    Thank you very much.    Best Regards  Miguel ,adesert,,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Hello  My wife and are heading to Japan in November and are thinking of renting the Ninja wifi router. The packages available are 3 G 5G and 10G. We would basically be using this for google maps and google translate some texting as well. We will be traveling for 10 days and not sure which plan makes the most sense.  Thanks. ,Shazam,Tokyo,Frederikssund...
