Please add links to trip reports for your tours within the UK to this thread. If you can add a brief description (eg the thread header for the actual report) that could help people planning future trips that would be great.    I'm going to ask for this to be pinned and will add more posts with links to past reports. Please add links to your own or others that I've missed.

We wanted to do a day trip from London to Cotswold on Christmas day. I understand lots of restaurants will be closed but wanted to check if any cafes will be open ? What about public toilets ? ,Nitin A,Bourton-on-the-Water,
Hi    Has anyone stayed at the Royal Hotel Kettering recently? Their website is: https://royalhotelkettering.com/ I had a good experience there a few years ago but I'm planning to travel to Kettering again and I'm wondering whether to stay at the Royal Hotel or try somewhere else. Does anyone have any suggestions or recent experiences to share? ,kentkouh o,,

Hi!    We'll be there in March into April. She loves literature art and probably would be happy in a lot of different situations but cannot really walk far at all. Does anyone have recommendations for day trips that would include for lectures or classes?  Thanks! ,Tracy B,Scotland,
Hi there…So I’ve bought an Anytime Day ticket from Watford to Euston on 31 December - ticket booked for 13:34.  And also from St Pancras to Brighton at 16:54 on the 31st.  I just want to confirm that I can use the ticket on earlier or later trains on the same route? I need to know whether we have any flexibility with these times…  Should I expect these trains to be super busy? We’ll be a family of five traveling.  Thanks so much! ,ScottHick,London,"Johannesburg, South..."
Hi all    I'm planning a trip to Scotland in early July 2024. We fly in and out of Aberdeen and I want to show my husband some of the beauty of Scotland (I've travelled around it a bit 20+ years ago and loved it then but I have forgotten most of the places I've visited).    I don't want to drive - I just want to enjoy the landscape without worrying about managing left-hand drive so our options are public transport or cycling (with rented bikes). I would love to have a cycling holiday (I still remember the one I had in the Outer Hebrides around 26 years ago :D)    So the interests are:  - scenery - lakes forests in particular.  - exploring small towns/villages  - some castles/ruins  - at least one distillery tour as we love whiskey and gin :-)  - relaxed pace picnics some exercise and loads of fresh air :)    We are both not very fit (but plan to start riding our bikes in the spring to work up our fitness level a bit.) I would love to stay in small quirky B&Bs get some Scottish food and drinks meet some people make some great memories and most of all - show my husband how beautiful Scotland is with a hope to lure him back there again.    Currently I have the following three itineraries in mind and I would appreciate any input (as I want to see it ALL :D which obviously is not going to happen and I am having a very hard time to make up my mind).    https://ej.uz/scotland-version-1 - this includes the Glendfiddish distillery which I would love to visit but I am worried about how realistic this is for two non-professional cyclists.    https://ej.uz/scotland-version-2 - this seemed like the easiest version of the three but I am not sure how exciting that part of Scotland is in terms of scenery.    https://ej.uz/scotland-version-3 - this I put together after some research here on Tripadvisor to include Oban and Glencoe. The same as for version1 no idea how realistic is to cycle this route in 6 days - maybe need use trains for some parts?    I hope I have given enough info to get an idea of what we're after. Would appreciate any comments criticism and suggestions. :-) ,Anda C,Scotland,
Hi    I'm searching train tix to Eastbourne in March. There are plenty of advanced tickets for 6 pounds just about every day but checking the two Saturdays available (March isn't fully open for sale yet) the tickets are only anytime flex and are 40 pounds! That's a huge difference and Saturday is our day to travel.    Can anyone in the know tell me - is this normal? Only full priced flex tickets on Saturdays? At that price for 2 pp we are better off renting a car.    thanks for any info ,SEIdahoThomas,London,"Pocatello, Idaho"
Hi I will be flying into Liverpool airport on Boxing Day landing at 12pm and heading to Manchester for the game that night. I have just found out that the trains are off that day. I see that i can get a bus into Liverpool centre and a bus onto Manchester.  I'm wondering if anyone knows if there is a private coach company that goes from the airport to Manchester direct.    Thanks ,CoDown,Manchester,belfast
My husband and I will be staying a night in Oxford before staying in the Cotswold area for 2 nights. We are then heading towards Liverpool. We will have a car and will be travelling in February. Any suggestions on where to stay in Cotswold. We like a B & B or small inn within walking distance to restaurants. We are in our 60’s so happy with a quiet location. Thank you in advance for any suggestions. ,JanandDan,Cotswolds,"Duncan, Canada"
Looking at a week in the Lakes early June - last year we stayed at Troutbeck (the one near Windermere as aware there’s two). Cottage was fab so we’re tempted to return but aware that means either redoing some of the walks close by or having to travel further each day.    Looking at Southern Lakes - to keep journey time down - so after any suggestions please - been looking at Hawkshead/Grizedale area.    We’re 4 adults moderate walkers who enjoy getting up on the tops but also low level walking. Ideally would like to think we can spend 2/3 days walking from the door and otherwise no more than 20/30 mins drive each day. .    Many thanks. ,AztecLife,Lake District,United Kingdom
Hello! My family and I are traveling into London from the US in June 2024. We are scheduled to visit this part of the planet for three weeks. We’d love some suggestions on where to go!    So far we’ve considered a London - England - Scotland - Ireland trip as well as a London - Amsterdam - Bruges - Scotland trip.    We like to adventure around cities people watch eat yummy food and drink wine check out the touristy stops (a mixture of landmarks quick museum trips and pretty sites). We are both in our 30s and will be traveling with our 6 year old daughter.    Any suggestions in terms of where to go and what to do are welcome! Thank you! ,Mackenzie H,London,

Booked for 8 - 12th Feb (which is a Thur - Mon)    Provisionally booked the Premier Inn Southwark station in a family room as we are a family of 4 with 2 adults and 2 girls aged 11 and 9.    We want this to be a fun trip for them and hopefully with some great restaurants (and bars for us) and some interesting and fun activities weather permitting.    I've started to make a shortlist(ish) to try and narrow down the scope so I am hoping to put this in a logical order by day what makes sense to do when or at the weekend etc.    These are not must-dos but just some ideas from reading the forum I don't want to overload the trip with history/museums but a sprinkle would be fine :)    Potential Todos:  - Wicked (show)  - Graffiti tunnel - near hotel  - Natural History and Science Museum  - Thames Rockets tour high speed RIB or City Cruise  - the glass pavement on Tower Bridge  - Tower of london  - watching the street entertainers in Covent Garden  - Hamleys/Lego Store/M&M store/ shopping (Oxford street?)  - London Dungeon (heard its good fun)  - London Eye  - Buckingham palace (outside only)  - Borough Market    Outside London:  Hampton Court Palace? Not sure enough time or interest for this.    Food:  Flat Iron  Fishcotheque  Heddon Street Kitchen (Ramseys kids eat free)  Inamo Covent Garden  Wahaca Southbank  OXO Tower Brasserie  Hardrock (fun experience?)  The Ampersand Hotel in Kensington boasts a Jurassic afternoon tea    My two girls are also into football and we have seen Liverpool and Barcelona in their respective stadiums so a championship game *might* be worth a look depending on schedule/location.    I also notice that there is a childrens festival at that time in South Bank which will hopefully have some ideas but at first glance it appears mostly suited for younger kids. ,sterankin,London,Belfast
Hi there!    We are planning a 14-16 day trip to the UK from Canada in late April. We've been to Scotland solo but this time we'll be traveling with our two children (2 and 4). We will be flying from Toronto and likely landing in London or similar cost conscious city. We are hoping to spend 7 days in England and 7 days in Scotland but that's not a hard and fast rule. I would love some suggestions for interesting destinations that are easier with kids. Also open to making our way to Wales as well! (Although I realize we don't have much time to play around with).    Any itinerary suggestions would be warmly welcome!    Here is our wish list:    - unique historical sites  - minimal tourist attractions  - focus on beautiful scenery  - charming historical towns and villages  - pastoral views countryside  - some larger cities but not super touristy  - charming English cottages distilleries historical landmarks market towns etc.  - beautiful beaches  - places like the Cotswolds Yorkshire etc  - Traditional crafts tours (milling local trades etc)  - Kid's attractions (just 1 or 2) ,Dee Fitz,,"Elora, Canada"

Thanks for previous advice. Am spending 7 days in Kettlewell in 1st week of June walking with family (I'm based in Australia). Will meet my family in Kettlewell but visiting friends in Lincoln before and can get train to Ilkley or Skipton. Would the walk from Skipton/Embsay via cracoe (Over moors paths not road) to Grassington or from Ilkley/Bolton Abbey to Grassington along river be nicer? I will overnight in Grassington then walk to Kettlewell to meet family (Driving from London) so either way need to end at Grassington. I'm thinking via the moors for the views as I don't mind up and down but thought I would check in with the locals to see if anyone had done or had advice. Am fine walking long distances with a pack as lots of experience. ,ldj226,Yorkshire Dales National Park,"Brisbane, Australia"

I had my birthday dinner at Nopi in 2014 and if I recall correctly there were two choices for seating: one at a long shared table with a view of the open kitchen and another with separate tables although pushed close together. We chose the latter and it was nice. Is it still arranged like that?    We will be back in April for my husband’s birthday. WhenI go online to reserve (which I will actually do later not now) I see the choices are “ground floor” and “downstairs”. Do these correspond to the shared table and separate table areas or has that changed? Which would be quieter? My husband cannot hear in noisy restaurants and finds the experience unpleasant so I want to try to avoid that.    If the noise of a “buzzy” atmosphere is unavoidable we will have to skip Nopi. In that case what alternative would you suggest that is quiet? Italian/Mediterranean food is our favorite; French or seafood are also possibilities as is a more casual wine bar with nice small plates. We will be going for Indian food on a different night and have that sorted.    We will be staying at Apex Temple Court hotel ( Fleet Street x Fetter Lane) and later in the West End near Trafalgar Square. We are happy walking up to a km or so and can use the #15 bus to move east-west on the axis between Trafalgar Square and Tower Hill. But we do not wish to take the Tube to a restaurant (or most anywhere for that matter).    Thank you for your suggestions. ,Enzian,London,Seattle

I have vertigo and vertical pull as a result of a spinal injury it is triggered by being at the edge of things. Acclimatising cannot help it as it is down to a physical injury and surgery is just not worth the risk.  I did the WHW this year I love being outdoors and wobbled on (very bravely I must say) through the tricky bits. That was fun for my lovely OH who gamely took the outsides and my complaining .  I was looking to do Cowhill but would like to give myself a nice walk with great views and I wondered if the track was away from the edge?  i can't tell from the reviews and photos any help appreciated. ,dippyem,Fort William,sunny glasgow

Hello! My family is traveling to London from March 29-April 5. March 29 is good Friday but we are not arriving until late in the evening so I am hoping the holiday will not impact us in any great way. I am hoping for some feedback on accommodations we have found on Airbnb. Our family is 2 adults and 3 children ages 14 11 and 9. Based on this I am thinking an Airbnb is going to be our best option to comfortably host us for the week. We are looking for a home base so we don't have high needs. Most important to us is clean safe walking neighborhood easy access to the tube (in zone 1 or 2 if possible) and a neighborhood that has eateries and groceries. Trying to avoid to far outside of central London. Our budget per night is between 200-275 GBP. Many many years ago I lived in London in the Muswell Hill neighborhood. I can't remember how long it took me to travel to central London even though I went to King's Cross daily from bounds green! I this neighborhood a good one for my family and what we are hoping for? It would be fun to be back there after 20+ years. Below of the listings we are looking at on Airbnb. Any feedback would be deeply appreciated as well as any suggestions/recommendations.    https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/767274784237253222?check_in=2024-03-29&check_out=2024-04-05&guests=1&adults=3&children=2&s=67&unique_share_id=8aea102b-984d-4998-bc11-fbae28afd536    https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13554539?check_in=2024-03-29&check_out=2024-04-05&guests=1&adults=3&children=2&s=67&unique_share_id=4e8c9b7d-1127-4299-96c6-2a4f3056fb33    https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25994759?check_in=2024-03-29&check_out=2024-04-05&guests=1&adults=3&children=2&s=67&unique_share_id=b773e44b-aa2d-4394-b005-d64fa90c2bc8    https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/834029656884495411?check_in=2024-03-29&check_out=2024-04-05&guests=1&adults=3&children=2&s=67&unique_share_id=96c6ecc4-963b-4a1e-8bcc-bcf91cbc59cd ,Ally B,London,

After having a lovely visit to Mevagissey 2 wks ago I received a parking fine from Premier Parking Solutions. Turns out if you use the left hand parking machine which doesn’t allow you to enter your reg number and make the correct payment then you do not have a valid parking ticket and will be fined.  It’s just a con and so I’d recommend everyone avoid this car park. A quick google shows I’m not the first person to fall victim to this fraudulent practice so please be warned. ,Adrian G,Mevagissey,

Hi I am visiting London Jan 4-6 and wanted to get a ticket up to Sky Garden but their website really has not been user friendly I checked a by bc h of times when new tickets were going to be released but no luck. Now they’re onto the next week after I’ll be gone so I guess I missed out. My question is does anyone have experience just trying to be a walk in day of? The website says based on availability (obviously) so wondering if it’s easier than I would think. Alternatively does making a free reservation at the Sky Pod or City Garden bars or any of the restaurants get you access to the rest of the space? ,Toni-ann C,London,New Jersey

We are planning to travel from Premier Inn County Hall to St Pancras Station on 16th July (Tue) to catch the 11:04 Eurostar to Brussels. If we take a cab from PI County Hall at 9 am will we be able to arrive at St Pancras by 10 am to check in for the 11:04 train barring unforeseen incidents?    We are not familiar with London morning traffic; and therefore need advice on that.    We are in our early 70s and would prefer to take a cab instead of the tube as we would have two luggage plus hand luggage.    Alternatively we could leave PI County Hall late afternoon the day before and overnight at Premier Inn St Pancras or PI Kings Cross. In that case we would book the 9:01 train since there would be no risk of rush-hour traffic.    Which would be a better option?    Thank you for your advice.

Hi all hoping for some help with the everlasting question of ‘which hotel should I choose?’  I am happy enough with the room rate and location of all of these but what I’m not sure about is what the ambiance/vibe/sense of place is for the locality of each.    For context it is a second visit to London for Mr Daffstarring and I although our first was about 15 years ago. First visit for our kids (11 & 12). We are hoping to have six nights at the end of June 2024. We plan to arrive via Eurostar from Paris and will be exploring more of England after London.    The shortlist I have is:  - Park Plaza County Hall (is there a reason it’s so much cheaper than Westminster Bridge?)  - Park Plaza Victoria  - The Goodenough Hotel  (I also looked at the Mercure Hyde Park and Bloomsbury but didn’t like them as much.)    Would greatly appreciate any input. ,daffstarring,London,Queensland...

Hello -    We are flying from Charlotte NC to Manchester getting in at 10:00 p.m. on Friday October 20th. We will be attending the Liverpool vs. Everton game currently scheduled for Saturday October 21st (could possibly get moved but won't know until 6 weeks out). The following weekend we will be attending the Manchester City vs. Manchester United game in Manchester currently scheduled for Saturday October 28th (could also get rescheduled). We will fly home to Charlotte from Manchester on Monday October 30th.    We really want to spend time in London and Paris but don't know if this would be too much traveling for the dates we will be there (October 20th - October 30th) due to the soccer games. This will be our first time visiting Europe and it is for our 10 year wedding anniversary. Thoughts on itinerary? Am I crazy to try to fit this all in? Only thing that is for sure is the soccer games and the flights. The rest is TBD.    Also we will have a 9 hour layover in London on our way to Manchester. Should we just stay at the airport during that time or is there anything we can go and see?    Thanks in advance! ,CLT_Traveler,London,"Charlotte, North..."
My daughter is wanting to book flights today and I know the days of the weeks make a big difference for only 8 days of sightseeing. She and her husband are taking their 3 kids (ages 7 9and 12) on the family’s first trip to England in mid July (only time they can go)    My daughter has always wanted to see the Cotswolds and they thought the kids would really enjoy seeing their first castle since this is the kid’s first trip abroad so we planned Windsor at the end to be close to the airport— and use that time for the required “pool” time that all kids want on vacation!    Thoughts? The best priced slights are on Monday and Tuesday departure but I was worried the Cotswolds might be even more crowded on the weekend.

Hello all. Spent a week in London last October and barely scratched the surface. I (+1) had an ambitious itinerary but the experts here basically said “That’s not happening mate” and they were right. So here’s what I was able to accomplish in a rather inefficient seven days:  Treasures of the British Library  British Museum (Ancient Egypt & Greece two separate visits)  Natural History Museum  Science Museum  V&A (quickie)  Palace Green Kensington Gardens Hyde Park  IWM London (WWI only)  The National Gallery (quickie)  Cambridge and Wren Library  Sky Garden sunset (by way of Darwin Brasserie resy)  Sir John Soane’s Museum  Bank of England Museum  Camden Market  Borough Market  Westminster Cathedral  Graffiti Tunnel  Changing of the Guard  Tower of London (Missed the Ceremony of the Keys. 10 quid down the tube station Sunday night closure. Lesson learned yeah.)    Best of all everything but the Tower was free. Isn’t that amazing? On top of viewing the usual landmarks quiet tube rides (even during rush hour) and safe at all hours strolls London is simply fantastic. When a week opened up in my calendar for March it was an easy decision to come back. Eight days this time. It’s like scrolling through Netflix. What do I want to binge watch today? Real crime? War? Music? The Windsors? It’s all right here. Please London regale me with your debauched history. Ply me with wine and meat pies.    Last visit I stayed at three places (credit card perks since you’re wondering): The Bloomsbury (good) Hilton Park Lane (cool Hyde Park view) and the Conrad (major disappointment; only thing it had going for it was the tube station… and umbrellas). This time I’ve decided on the Canopy London City.    Food hits: Spaghetti House Kensington High Street The Feathers (three visits glad it was next to the Conrad) Sunday Roast Hawksmoor Air Street Dominos (to the rescue).    Food misses: Darwin Brasserie (mediocre steak server pressing me for a tip even though a service charge was already added) Circolo Popolare Where the Pancakes Are Flat Iron Square Afternoon Tea at the Savoy (no dress code I should have went to Starbucks) Sino Thai Restaurant Smokeworks Cambridge.    This time around I’m solo for five days then it’s plus two for the remaining three. Since the plus two would rather binge watch Love Island I’ve got five days of peaceful museum visits. My shortlist itinerary:  Westminster Abbey  St. Paul’s Cathedral  Oxford - Ashmolean Museum  IWM London (WWII at least)  Churchill War Rooms  British Museum    And that’s about it. Anything else is gravy. Thanks for reading. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ,ElNinoDorado,London,"New York City, New..."
TA experts-considering a trip to the dales after other TA experts letting me know my trip covering the entire island was a bit aggressive. My SO and I would love to find a small village with an inn or an airbnb walking distance to a pub for meals. We will be coming from London so want this part of our trip to be relaxing. We would drive to locations in the park for walking and sightseeing.    I was a big fan of the James Herriott books so I'm looking for that small stone village with a picturesque river running through it and a quiet pub where old men are playing dominoes and drinking pints.    Appreciate anyone's suggestions on locations! ,Illiniwek66,Yorkshire Dales National Park,Bloomington-Normal...

Greetings  Trying to get from Glasgow airport to St Andrews this coming May. Will be arriving on a Wednesday around noon. When looking it seems either Car rental or bus is the most economical. Having problems finding car services as well.  I have a couple questions...    1. What are the roads like between the airport and St Andrews if we decide to drive? Interstate? two lane? Easy to navigate?  Is it possible to drive there and drop car off there rather than return to Glasgow?    2. Is there a car service you would recommend as we would prefer to not drive ourselves as only in St Andrews for 48 hours before continuing on to Edinburgh so don't want to hassle returning cars etc.    Thanks in advance for all your help! ,Islandsluver2go,St. Andrews,"Fayetteville, North..."
We have a 10a admission to Windsor castle on 12/27 (parents & teen girls) then an evening show at the West End. Are there any stops between the two we should make in the afternoon? No car pubic transport ride-share or walking only. We will have plenty of time downtown on other days so just looking for stops along the way. ,MPB,England,"Queen Creek, Arizona"
I’d love to hear any recommendations on London area pantos for the holiday season—December 2023.  - first trip to UK no car  -parents plus teen girls  -already seeing Peter Pan goes wrong so not the PP Panto  -prefer family friendly more clean less crude  -I’ve done some research but pantos are new territory for me and we’re excited to check it out. We love plays and musicals so I’m surprised I haven’t heard of these before. Are there just a handful of major productions usually or are there many many more that just don’t get as much marketing?    Carol sing-alongs are another UK tradition that we’re not used to as much in the US where we’re coming from. Anything else along those lines that are unique holiday experiences for us Americans? I realize that’s a pretty broad question but just throwing it out there. ,MPB,England,"Queen Creek, Arizona"
I really would like to spot some coos. We will be at Ruthven Barracks and hope to see them there. If not are there other places that they usually can be seen? Not sure we will be passing by the farm in Ft Wlliam area (?) where I read you can feed them. . ,Bronna L,Scotland,"New York City, New..."
Hi as a first-time visitor to the UK I'm wondering if it is more economical to pre book tours through the likes of viator etc. or wait and book through local operators in London. ,Gary B,,"Perth, Australia"
Is it possible to get from the cruise ship terminal in Southampton after disembarking from a cruise ship toLHR in order to make a 4 PM flight out?  It seems that using the national express bus is the most direct way but I have no idea about time.  I assume we can self disembark as early as possible maybe around 9 o’clock at the latest.  Any thoughts on this matter from people who have done this or anyone else. ,shenetic,Southampton,State College...
Hello we are in the beginning stages of planning a trip to London and Scotland. We originally had Ireland included but after reading many posts here we’ve excluded it due to only having 10 days. It’s our first time traveling internationally. We plan to move at a moderate pace but nothing to crazy. My son will either be 20 or 21 (depending on which month we go) and I will be 53.    I have a few questions/ideas on getting our base started and would love some insight and help please.    1)We are looking at either first or second week of June or October. We like the idea of longer days/less rain in June but also like the idea of lower humidity/temps in Oct.Is there anything that should sway us one way or another? Bank holidays crowds etc? We both hate hot (over 85 degrees temps).  2) We will leave on a Wednesday from Kentucky and fly into London and head home on a Friday from Edinburgh. We are flexible on these days/flights if we can get better rates on flights/hotels.  3) On arrival day we plan to check in and just do a few things around our hotel we want to hit the main points. Big Ben Westminster Abbey London Bridge Buckingham Palace Changing of the King’s Guard etc. My son would also like to see King Arthur's Tomb in Glastonbury so we are looking for a day trip with a travel agency for this day and recommendations? We plan on doing Thurs-Sat at a moderate pace is this enough time for this area? Also do we need to buy our tickets ahead of time for most of these attractions?  4) We would love to stay in a central location with safety being top priority would love some feedback on hotels to look into?  5) On Sunday we plan to take the Linear Train to Edinburgh probably the 10ish train time. Get there check in and do things around the hotel maybe check out the Edinburgh Castle if we have time. Would also love hotel suggestions for this area. If we are short on time or tired we will plan to see the Edinburgh Castle the next morning and maybe check out some other areas within walking distance..would love suggestions. Then on either Monday or Tues I’m wanting to book a 3 day tour with Rabbies Travel to see our main highlights of Scotland. We thought this would be best cause we don’t want to rent a car.  6) Then we will fly out of Edinburgh on Friday.  Also  7) How bad is the pickpocketing and phone snatching? I was totally unaware of this until doing some research. Do I need a special bag and will we be able to access our phones to use citymap or Google or should they be kept in a bag I’ve seen lots of conflicting info on this and want to start doing some prepping on things we may need to buy now.    Any ideas or additional tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ,Shonda W,London,
We are going to London to celebrate my husband’s 80th and he wants to see several plays. The Player Kings” was an easy choice and I bought tickets for that but am looking for one or possibly 2 more.    He wants to see British productions not Broadway plays or musicals. And no slapstick comedy.    Among the National Theatre offerings I found the following: “London Tide” and “Nye” at the Southbank location both new shows with no reviews yet. And “Standing at the Sky’s Edge” which has very good reviews and is moving to the Gillian Lynne Theatre very close to our hotel.    That last appears to be a good choice but how can we choose between the other two when the play hasn’t started a run yet and there are no reviews?    And are there others we should consider? Some friends recommend the old classic “Mousetrap” which we have never seen. We did enjoy “Witness for the Prosecution” on our last visit; is Mousetrap at all similar? And how is the venue? Is St. Martin’s Theatre possibly uncomfortable for one with vertigo (me)? In other words very steep like the Shaftsbury which I found challenging for access to our seats? (Once seated I was OK apart from dreading the exit!)    Thank you for your help. ,Enzian,London,Seattle
I’ll be heading to London with my 7 year-old son for a quick two days on our way back from Paris. Trying to decide whether to visit the Tower of London on SUNDAY January 14 or MONDAY January 15. Will there be appreciably less tourists on a weekday vice that Sunday? Or is it always crowded? (-: Hoping for quiet so we can explore and not be lost among the crowds. Thanks so much!!!! ,diwinje,London,"Potomac, Maryland"
My husband and I are from California he’s been a huge Everton FC fan since he was a teenager. It’s been a dream of his to go see his team play at their home stadium. Not to mention he is graduating college this December I thought I would celebrate his accomplishments by surprising him on a trip!  Now I’m planning on taking this trip in Fall of 2024 that way I have more than enough time to plan the trip accordingly . Would love to stay here 5 days.  I would love to get some help from locals or people that have been here before on where to stay transportation where to eat things to see and most importantly how to get tickets to see Everton play at their home stadium.  I appreciate your help in advance! :) ,Jomalaquias,Liverpool,
We are planning a trip for March 2024 for my spouse our 2 teens and myself. Teens are 16 and 19 and functionally we are 4 adults. I posted earlier about budget and got some hotel suggestions and now have a more specific question.    We are looking at March 23-30 7 nights. At this point we think we will stay in London for the full 7 nights and may take 1 or 2 day trips out of the city. We are thinking we would like a central location that allows us to see various sites that are centrally located and then be able to access public transport to move around the city.    I'm currently looking at the Premier Inn London Southwark (Southwark Station) and I'd love feedback on that choice and other suggestions.    Hotel criteria-  4 people ideally a double room and a room with 2 twin beds  Adjoining rooms ideal but not a deal breaker  We like on-site breakfast as an option but it isn't a deal breaker  Budget matters we'd like to keep it under 2200 pounds  I'm currently seeing a price of 1852 pounds at this London Southwark  In the US we are regulars at Hilton properties but I don't see a benefit to that other than our points. The cheaper properties seem to have pretty marginal reviews. Outside of that they get expensive.  We have looked at some independent hotels often mentioned but I can't get them to this price but we are open to other suggestions  We are not motivated by self-catering on vacation and so an apartment doesn't help us unless it is inexpensive  Not interested in the Hub hotels due to room size    So any feedback on this hotel suggestion and I'd love suggestions of other locations to look where Premier Inn or something similar might fit our budget. Our main criteria are really option of a twin room location and price. ,Natalie T,London,Minneapolis...
Hello fellow travellers    1. I am scheduled to arrive at LHR terminal 2 on 17 May 24 at 8 am by SIA    2. I am scheduled to depart from LHR terminal 5 on the same day at 1 pm by BA.    3. These are 2 separate ticket bookings.    4. On paper it appears that I have 5 hours in between these 2 flights.    5. Is this usually sufficient time for me to disembark from T2 and then depart from T5 at 1 pm? Have I left myself with insufficient margin/buffer?    Any input would be much appreciated.    Many thanks. ,Edmund P,London,"Singapore, Singapore"
My husband and I will be in London for 4 full days (5 nights) in late April. I'm just starting to plan itinerary and would appreciate comments/suggestions. We have been to London before and seen all the high points: Buckingham Palace Westminster St. Paul's Big Ben etc. Aren't interested in a repeat except the V&A which I can never get enough of.    We are slow travelers don't like to just rush from point to point to check a site off our list. We like to linger and savour the culture and atmosphere. We enjoy meandering around local places looking in the shops window shopping stopping for coffee and people watching. So far this is the outline of what I'm thinking:    Day 1: Arrive 12:30 pm from Canada take tube to accommodation in Earl's Court get settled get some groceries and just wonder the neighbourhood a bit. Grab a meal and go to sleep.    For the other four days we want to go to Greenwich for a day take the boat out.    Another day we are thinking about heading to Bletchley. Not sure on that one. Any suggestions on what to do instead that doesn't involve the major museums/churche etc.    On April 22nd there is a short evening choral concert at St. Martins in the Fields we are interested in. May spend part of the day around there Covent Gardens etc. and grab a light meal at the cafe in the church prior to the concert. Are there other interesting streets/places to meander around there? Probably woulld wonder around Trafalgar Square but not interested in going to the National Museum again.    THen there's the day I want to go to the V&A. My husband is not as keen as me but there are other more science/natural history museums close by that i'm sure he can spend a few hours in. What else could we fill that day up with?    Oh and on April 23rd we're going to ABBA Virtual.    Then we're heading to Oxford for 3 days then on to Paris.    I have always appreciated the insights i get from these forums and look forward to the suggestions and wisdom I know I'll get. Thanks in advance! ,Barb M,London,"Saskatoon, Canada"
I’m curious about the above rental car option which seems novel and more affordable than many including extra drivers and GPS at no extra cost.  I’m unsure if it’s a wholesaler from the promotion but it doesn’t appear so. It seems cars can be delivered to and picked up from a nominated location.  Has anyone got knowledge/experience of it and if so what are the pluses and minuses? I don’t see any reference to it at least in the London Forum.  Expedia include it in their options but direct bookings can bypass Expedia. ,marshall p,London,Auckland Central...

Hi all  I will be arriving in August at 10 am for one night. My next flight is at noon the next day.    With that said this is my first time in London.

Would like to also absorb the beautiful architecture and wander around a bit before calling it a night.    Not sure how to incorporate my “wants” into an efficient itinerary.

Now that I’ve had your help with easy-to-reach hotels in Belfast and Londonderry we have a draft itinerary. We are two women mid 60s no mobility issues (but not hikers!).    Sept. 2: Arrive Dublin pick up rental car drive to Belfast. Two nights Premier Inn Titanic  Sept. 3: tour Belfast  Sept. 4: drive coastal route Belfast to Ballycastle overnight there  Sept. 5: drive Ballycastle to Londonderry. Two nights Londonderry possibly Maldon Hotel  Sept. 6: tour Londonderry*  Sept. 7: drive Londonderry to Westport (stop in Donegal?). Overnight Westport  Sept.8: drive Westport to Galway via Connemara. Two nights in Galway  Sept. 9: fun in Galway  Sept. 10: morning in Galway. Afternoon drive to Dublin return car overnight Premier Inn Swords  Sept. 11: very early flight to Rome    *my father served 3 years on convoy ships with the Royal Canadian Navy during WWII and spoke very fondly of the times he spent in Derry. He passed last year at age 100 and how I wish he was still here to know that I will visit this city that held so many memories for him. I know that the barracks are no longer there and I know that a maritime museum is being built. Is there presently any sort of monument or attraction related to Derry’s importance during the war?    Re the itinerary I know that it would be SO much easier if we flew in and out of Belfast and spent all of our time in NI but we’ve had two previous trips to the Republic of Ireland (one of them together) and neither of us got to Galway either time — this may be our last chance. We haven’t booked flights yet so if there’s anywhere that you think we absolutely should extend our time by a day please chime in!    Many thanks! ,Dianne B,Northern Ireland,"Ottawa, Canada"

We're thinking of spending a couple of days both in Oxfordshire and the South of Scotland around Glasgow after Easter next year. My husband would like to drive especially since the main purpose is to go to the famous bookshop in Wigtown. The cost for a one-way rental is not too bad and he'd like to drive it in one day. Google gives a driving time of about 7 hours.    I think the Caledonian Sleeper train would be more comfortable but also more expensive. And then there is the plane. ..  Both train and plane would mean renting another car for a few days.    Can I ask for your advice? What would you do?    Thank you for any information. ,MannheimTraveller,,"Mannheim, Germany"
Hi. Planning UK 2024 trip. London for 5 or so days then Windsor Bath a village in the Cotswolds maybe south to the ocean unsure where else in England yet. Will probably get train to York stay a couple days then to Newcastle husband is a Newcastle football fan then train up to Scotland.    Is it easy to get a train to Windsor Bath and the Cotswolds? Yes I know I need to do more research but it gets overwhelming. Are there places/towns we should see that most tourists miss? We love history and sightseeing we are in our 50’s and will have a 20 yr old with us. Husband likes to walk a lot I don’t. I have done a UK contiki tour 25 years ago minimal time spent in most of the places we went. I’m not sure about hiring a car hence the train question. We may drive on the same side of the road but I think your roads are probably quite different to ours. ,Tarola1,,"Sydney, Australia"

Bit of a long shot but I think BL questions have attracted a number of replies in the past.    As background for those that don't know the BL was the subject of a ransomware attack in late October and its systems are still down. The Reading Rooms are open but you need to know the shelfmark of an item you want (stored at St Pancras not Boston Spa) and order it manually at the desk. The catalogue is due to come back online mid-January which should help in finding shelfmarks.    Has anyone done this since the system failure and can let me know how well it works? I could really do with a day or two there for research in January but don't want to bother if it's not realistically possible to get books delivered reasonably promptly. ,Astolat,London,"Guildford, United..."

Late June - likely on a Saturday or Monday - 2 adults and 2 11-year olds. We would like to take a short trip out of the city for something with higher interest for the girls. (Will be out of the city for Harry Potter Studios but would like something in addition on a different day).    I have researched so many options and have let go of the idea of a trip to Oxford or Bath. I think I've settle on a trip to Windsor Castle. I don't want to run us to exhaustion with scheduled things but they are building up with some in the evenings. So unless advised differently I'm thinking of a later start to get to Windsor Castle to make for a more relaxing start to our day. That said how much time do I need to allow for transportation there and back as well as the castle tour. We want to do this on our own - not with a Viator tour etc. ,Surgie,London,Illinois

First timers to Edinburgh here. We will be staying in Old Town area for one night (a Friday) and as we will be on foot we are looking for a good location for walking and exploring the Royal Mile area. My question is what area of Old Town do you recommend? Was looking at accommodations at opposite ends that both get good reviews—Premier Inn Royal Mile and Wilde Apartments near Edinburgh Castle. Although a good location is ideal we always prefer a hotel with nice surroundings and atmosphere too. Recommendations or advice much appreciated! ,sunnygirl0524,Edinburgh,british columbia

Hello  We are couple in mid 40s with 8 years old. We will be flying from Seattle in mid-March have 9 days (excluding travel days) to spend/split between London Edinburgh and Scottish Highlands. For both cities we will be dependent on public transport and for Highlands we will take rental car. Being in very initial stage we are trying to figure how many days to be spend at these places. Except flights I have not booked anything yet.  For our interests we are not much heavy on history but natural places scenery scenic drives and architeture attract us.  I am going through old posts and feeling overwhelmed already so obviously I will need to narrow down depend on our interests and weather at that time (mid to late March).  At high level I can come up with below plan. Would you suggest it this way or want to change something?  14-March - Fly out of Seattle - 5:15 PM  15-March - Reach LHR - 9:40 AM. After hotel check-in second half day in London  16-March - London  17-March - London - After full day in Londay get on night train to Edinburgh (Caledonian Sleeper)  18-March - Reach Edinburgh at 8 AM. Pick up rental car and head to highlands  19-March - Highlands  20-March - Highlands  21-March - Highlands and reach back to Edinburgh by evening drop rental car.  22-March - Edinburgh  23-March - Edinburgh  24-March - Fly out of Edinburgh at 8:45 AM  Please suggest.  [Reason to pick night train is I can have full day in London till late evening. And reason to leave next day for Highlands is we will not get hotel check-in so early so heading out. Please let me know if you would change it]  [Also for initial couple of days we will hit with jetlag too. Hopefully it will not hit hard]  Thanks ,trvlr1010,Scotland,Washington

I am going to be flying into London from the US this summer and I am in the beginning stage of putting together an itinerary. The trip would have to be roundtrip London because they have the cheapest flights back to the US.    Day 1 - London  Arrive in the afternoon and check into the hotel near Covent Gardens. Spend the evening seeing some of the city or walking around the hotel.    Day 2 - 4: London    Day 5: London - Lille  Board the Eurostar from London to Lille France and stay there for the night. I could also forget this stop and go straight to Paris. What do you guys think?    Day 6: Lille - Strasbourg  Leave Lille in the morning and travel by train to Strasbourg France. The only problem with this is the train stops in Paris which kind of seems like I should have stopped there instead of go back. Anyways we would stay at Strasbourg for the night and explore the city.    Day 7: Strasbourg - Zurich - Lucerne    Day 8: Lucerne    Day 9: Lucerne - Interlaken    Day 10: Interlaken    Day 11: Interlaken - Bern    Day 12 : Bern - Colmar - Paris  This is the weird one since i’m basically going back to some of the stops I didn’t explore when I went on the train the first time. I decided on Colmar even though I would have been really close to it the first time after Strasbourg. This would be my first night in Paris    Day 13 - 15: Paris  Thinking of staying one night near disneyland paris.    Day 16: Paris - London  Take the Eurostar from paris to london. Take a flight that day from London to the US.        I’m starting to second guess this itinerary. Is this too much train rides. I would buy the Eurrail pass. But I feel like it’s weird because I have to go back and do the same stops. I was also thinking of going all the way down to Milan Italy and take a flight back to London then a flight to the US. ,john m,London,Los Angeles...
This is a bit of a “ fishing” post so please bear with me. Right now we are at the very beginning of planning a return trip to England Ireland and N. Ireland next Autumn. The rough dates would between September 13 and October 18. Nothing is confirmed but we do know where we want to go. A return visit of 3 nights in Cambridge is on the list. Though irrelevant to this discussion we would be basing ourselves with relatives in Surrey whilst in England meeting friends in ROI and staying with family in NI. Again no definite plans have been made.    Here’s where I would appreciate your help. Within that timeframe are there dates we should avoid being in Cambridge for whatever reason? I will be asking the same re: Dublin another city we really enjoy. These bits of information help us plan our circuit.    Your responses will be much appreciated.

My husband and I will be traveling to Scotland a couple of days after Christmas and staying for two weeks (so until the first week of January) and we are are looking for suggestions for things to do or see that are specific to this season i.e. Christmas New Year or just winter in general. Things you may not get to experience if you come any other time of year.    We know of the Edinburgh Christmas market and the hogmanay street party but otherwise haven't found much.    We'll primarily be in Edinburgh but we are willing to travel around the country for great experiences if it's something we find interesting. (We have several days where we have not planned anything yet so plenty of time too.) ,L K,Scotland,
Hello. I’m wondering if there are car services that I can pre book to take me from Kensington area to St. Pancras. I’ll have 4 suitcases and a large container with my portable dialysis machine. I tried to book BlackBerry but they said they are only able to do airport transportation.    Will a can be able to fit my luggage? If so how do I schedule one for pickup on Wednesday morning?    Thanks in advance for any help you can provide! ,EllieandMilo,London,"Memphis, Tennessee"
Hi there.    I can’t seem to get through to anyone at Manchester airport so I’m hoping people here can help me out.    I have a flight booked with KLM to go from Manchester airport to Schiphol in Amsterdam. I want to travel with my Pomeranian in the cabin. KLM says that this fine. My question is if Manchester Airport allows pets through security? Has anyone been through this process? He will be kept in a carrier for the whole process.    I hope to hear from people soon. ,Xaitje,Manchester,

So im flying into London on Thursday lunchtime into Heathrow at T3 on Delta    1 . Can i get the piccadilly line to park Royal station from T3    2. I'm assuming from my previous posts regarding train travel that i can use my visa debit card or my Wise card to do contactless payments when using the underground.    3. how does this actually work because last time i was there i just bought a 1 day travel card so this system will be new to me.    Thanks ,pauls_pad2002,London,New Zealand
15 year old son will be travelling alone through Heathrow an airport we have never flown to. He needs to get from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3.    He's flying British Airways connecting with Cathay. Neither airline provides any assistance.    Is there a recommended service that will meet him at Terminal 5 gate and accompany him to Terminal 3 gate?    Thank you! ,pigletthepug,London,"Jakarta, Indonesia"

Part of my trip itinerary next summer is to drive back from Skye and stay in a place not too far from Edinburgh airport so the drive there the next morning won't be too long. We'll be staying several days in Edinburgh at start of our trip so thought not to stay again in Edinburgh at end of trip but instead stay somewhere nice for a late afternoon / evening and 1 overnight stay somewhere fairly close to the airport to fly home.    Because we'll be driving back from Skye we'll have limited time and figure we'll be arriving at our final stay destination sometime between 1pm and 6pm (depending on how early we get out of Skye). Just looking for a quaint town or village to walk around a little in the late afternoon or evening with some nice pubs for dinner options for us. Maybe some interesting tourist places to see nearby or on the route/drive back from Skye before we check into our hotel/B&B for the night. ,Rob55,Scotland,"Frederick, Maryland"
Here is a belated trip report for my 25 October to 8 November visit. Originally I had given a running color commentary on the The Layover Lounge Forum while I was in the UK but here's a proper report…    Everything changes in a moment.    June 10 2022 I headed out early on my bicycle to run a few errands only it wasn't until July 2 that I even started to become aware of what had happened. I'd been hit by a car at 50mph. Broke my back both legs left ankle left shoulder ribs collapsed lung and ruptured all the tendons in my left knee. Also treated for traumatic brain injury – thank God I'd turned my nose up at those wimpy little cycling helmets and embraced a heavier duty multi sport helmet.    Went from the trauma unit to a rehab hospital of course canceled my August ‘22 UK trip and came home in a wheelchair. I started physical therapy and got to a walker then a cane and started back to work on November 27 2022.    Throughout this whole experience what pained me most was that I canceled my August trip and no one could tell me when or if I'd get to travel again. I'd already accepted that there was no more cycling or backpacking but I couldn't imagine never doing England again.    Finished physical therapy in March ‘23. By April I was fed up enough not knowing that I bought tickets to the UK. I had to have firm goals my capabilities at work were improving and whether I could travel or not was all up to me and I was the only person that could build my strength and endurance. As I'd told myself many times “suck it up cupcake”.    I got it stuck in my mind that success was being able to walk the 0.7 of a mile from Broken Wharf across Millennium Bridge to Borough Market and back. That became my singularly focused goal. October ‘22 I could walk a 40 minute half mile with a walker by early May ‘23 I was down to a 20 minute half mile with a cane in June I'd reached 15 minutes and in early October ‘23 I broke 14 minutes. With a knee that doesn't flex a cane and a pretty gnarly scar across my forehead I was going to do this    All of this leads to 25 October and finally my trip to England. The my plans were to repeat previous travels push myself just enough and do what I know. This trip would be 5 nights in Chichester and 8 in London.    15 October I saw the news that Millennium Bridge closed for a three week maintenance period. Oh well “suck it up cupcake” scat happens 🙁.    25 October I walked the block from the house to my local Amtrak station and took the train to DC. I would fly United on from Dulles. I'd bought Amtrak business class tickets since it offered more leg room and assigned seats allowing me to score seat 1A and its nearly infinite legroom at the front of the carriage.    Arrived at Union Station with plenty of time to get to IAD so I grabbed breakfast a table and got the tablet out to monitor work’s YouTube channel and moderate channel comments. Time breezed by and I headed down to the Union Station Metro Station finally I was going to use the Silver Line all the way to Dulles. From the Dulles Metro station to the departures hall was my first long walk – no hurry just slow and steady.    I checked an empty hardshell carry-on sized bag. That bag was going to be for souvenirs coming home otherwise my actual carry-on bag was only 16 pounds. Headed down to TSA/security and was through in about three minutes. Then I made my way to the C/D Terminal via the aerotrain – a second long walk. As I waited for the next aerotrain an attendant with a chair approached me and offered to take me to C Terminal because “it's a long way”. I declined and told him the walk was something I needed to do. That gentleman discreetly followed till I reached the last escalator up to the C gates. That kindness meant to me.    Found a comfortable seat at my gate to surf the web and relax before boarding. A gate agent approached me to get me pre-boarded early and sent me on my way. I'd booked Premium Plus and seat 20L. Again plenty of room with my left toes just touching the bulkhead. A big plus for these seats were the recliner style leg rest coming up from below the seat which offered a lot of support and relief for my left leg. It was wonderful being on a flight once again. It was relaxed uneventful and I had a nice nap.    Landed at Heathrow Terminal 2 about 15 minutes early just after 5:30am. Walked off the plane found a toilet and freshened up a bit before beginning the trek to the e-gates. Slow and steady! All the other passengers were well enough ahead of me and by the time I got to immigration there was not a soul there and I breezed on through. My time at border control 1 minute!  Thursday October 26 was my travel day from London to Chichester and a 3pm check-in. Killed a couple hours at the Caffè Nero at T2 and then made my way down to the underground station – Piccadilly line to Circle line to Victoria Station. At Victoria I was steeling myself to make the last climb out of the tube station to the train station I felt a hand on my back the bag slipped off my arm and a voice that said luv I've got this for you. I choked up a little. Killed some time at Victoria before catching a train to Chichester lunch in town and then checked into my room. The rest of Thursday was a chill day. I'd been up since 3am Wednesday Virginia time and now it was late afternoon UK time.    Accommodations were at 4 Canon Lane operated by Chichester Cathedral. This building had been the archdeaconry and it now had 8 rooms and the room had been updated since my last stay in 2018.    My goal in Chichester was to enjoy the town and make return visits to the Mary Rose Museum and the Weald & Downland Museum.    27 October Friday morning woke up jumped on-line and bought train tickets to Portsmouth Harbour and back. Found a café for breakfast then headed to Portsmouth. I spent a good 5 hours at the Mary Rose Museum did okay with the walking and it was easy to find the occasional bench when needed. As part of their educational activities they had an artifact table where visitors could handle objects. We do the same at my own museum only with reproduction objects. I was amazed that at Mary Rose it was original artifacts from the archaeological excavation – 500 year old anchor rope that still smells of tar and 500 yo stone cannon shot. I might have been a bit giddy. Also ended up talking about museum business and compared notes with staff. Bought new copies of the book Before the Mast and a couple other titles about the archaeological studies. Headed back to Chichester.    Saturday morning the 28th had breakfast and planned out the day. Got the #60 bus and headed to the Weald and Downland. They were offering a 50% discount to visitors that arrived by local bus which was nice. The layout of the museum meant I'd have one of my longest walking and standing days. Well silly me I walked down to their blacksmith shop to see if it was fired up and working. Started talking to the smith and was quite surprised that 5 years after my last visit he still remembered me. There were few museum visitors so we probably ended up just talking shop and projects we'd worked on over the last 5 years for a good couple hours. Had lunch in the museum café then wandered through the other exhibit buildings. Again with few visitors that day it was a pleasure to get to talk “shop” with staff especially about museum education.    Took Sunday off and Monday spent a good part of the day touring the Cathedral. Tuesday was time to pack up and head back to London. Back in London I didn't relish facing the various stairs in tube stations with my souvenir case already gaining weight so I took my first London taxi to my hotel Locke-at-Broken-Wharf. It was interesting and became even more entertaining as my driver began to colorfully rant about the behavior of London cyclists on the road. He became animated and he wasn't wrong as I witnessed the worst road manners and disregard for traffic laws or for safety on the part of cyclists I'd ever seen. I was surprised I did not witness multiple car strikes. But I did have a little fun and got a great look of oh boy I stepped in it now when I shared I'd been hit by a car. But I was never offended at all and we had a good laugh. Checked into my room then walked to Co-Op to get a few groceries.    Wednesday 1 November was my visit to the Wallace Collection. When you get to know various artifacts through books and articles it's a whole new experience when you finally see the artifacts in person. I found myself texting photos to colleagues and receiving back requests to go get detailed photos of various other artifacts. And again bought more books.    Thursday I found the yarn shop Loop on Camden Passage in Islington. Bought a bunch of skeins of a sport weight medium-gray British wool spun in Yorkshire. Always fun being the only man in a yarn shop. Across the alley was a militaria shop and picked up a WW1 era Life Guards cap badge for a friend.    Friday 3 NovemberMillennium Bridge was still closed so I headed to Borough Market by the tube and stopped in Neal's Yard Dairy. Had a great time and probably spent a couple hours talking about cheese and selecting varieties not available at home. Mature Sparkenhoe Red Leicester Montgomery's Cheddar Doddington Pevensey blue and some 2 yo Dutch cheese from another vendor. Ended up with 2.5 kilos that would come home. Saturday was my visit to the V&A where I spent hours taking pictures of construction details on various pieces of iron work.    Sunday I walked to Borough Market by Southwark Bridge -- not the easiest stairs. Then I took the rest of the day off and watched from my hotel window as the various barriers were slowly removed from Millennium Bridge. When I read that Millennium Bridge would close for maintenance I just shrugged and thought to myself suck it up cupcake. In the last 16 months I'd gotten so used to telling myself that and I hadn't realized how wrapped up I'd gotten in the need to cross Millennium Bridge and walk to Borough Market it was affecting my feeling of accomplishment on this trip. I was letting it get me down. I had to cross that bridge but Borough Market was closed Monday. Instead I went to the Bank of England Museum and that evening I walked across the bridge and had supper.    Tuesday was a lazy morning then got myself ready and...    V-I-C-T-O-R-Y    I took that walk from Broken Wharf across Millennium Bridge to Borough Market had lunch then toured Southwark Cathedral and walked back to Broken Wharf.    Wednesday was my return home. My souvenir case had grown to 22 pounds and I didn't feel like dragging it to St Paul's station and down the stairs so I got a taxi to Tottenham Court Road Station and took the Elizabeth line to LHR. Checked my bag breezed through security and headed to the United Club lounge. UA919 to IAD again in Seat 20L. Used Mobile Passport Control and flew through immigration & customs in less than two minutes. Had several hours for a layover and headed to the Club at C7. Last flight was UA4473 to RIC and on a CRJ550 with seat 7A being perfect. Landed at Richmond and met my driver for my ride home to Williamsburg.    So this is the story of my most recent trip to England. I was prepared for it to be my last but it is not and there will be more. I'm thinking of a first visit to Ludlow a return visit to Ironbridge & London ,VAP1611,,Williamsburg...

Hello all    My family is going to be on the Isle of Skye between Christmas and NYE. A couple of questions:    1) I have found AirBnBs all over the island (although the pickings are slim) and wonder if we're better off paying for the more expensive place in Portree and using it as a home base to explore or paying less for a nice waterfront cottage somewhere else? Is it okay to be anywhere on the island this time of year? Is there a preferable location for first time visitors?    2) I wonder if anyone knows what sorts of things are open this time of year. Seems like a lot shuts down for the winter. We still want to go for the natural beauty but wonder if any of the sites will be accessible (like the castle at Dunvegan? Any boat tours?    Thanks for any assistance!    Cheers  Nate ,kznate 123,Isle of Skye,"Asheville, North..."
Hi  I’m looking for some recommendations of where we can take our son and now finance to celebrate their engagement. Looking to spend about £60-70 each for two courses without wine. Somewhere romantic and memorable. They live in Kidbrooke but we will be seeing Guys and Dolls in the evening so anywhere in central London would be great. This is for lunch. Thank you in advance. This is a February visit. ,Sunshine576554,London,"York, United Kingdom"
I've found a few places to stay around the island (July trip / 3 nights) and wondering thoughts or pluses and minues of each of these 3 locations... Uig Staffin and Waternish are the area a few places I've been looking at to consider booking. From what I've been reading on the forums not  quite sure Portree sounds that desirable to me with the noted parking challenges during the summer and also the restaurants are always booked/need to make reservations in advance. Thank you in advance. ,Rob55,Isle of Skye,"Frederick, Maryland"

I am considering one of these tours or neither of them. They are at the same time.    Westminster Abbey - supposedly it is a small group. However it will cost us more and not sure if it is worth it.

Hello- I am planning my first trip back to London since I was injured in an accident that left me with reduced mobility. At home I walk with forearm crutches but I can’t walk long distances even with the crutches so I am looking into renting a wheelchair for our trip. It will be my son and I and we will be visiting from Feb 18-26. This will be my son’s first visit.    I was originally thinking of booking a hotel along the Elizabeth line ideally near either the Bond Street or Tottenham Court Road stations but I’m questioning how much we will really be using the tube other than to and from Heathrow. On my last trip I traveled with my mom and found that we were using buses a fair amount. I’ve also read though that some bus drivers don’t always stop for passengers in wheelchairs? I guess my core question is whether or not it’s worth it to stay near the Elizabeth line or if a hotel near another station like Victoria Kings Cross Southwark or Waterloo could work well too? On my last trip I stayed at the Premier Inn County Hall and found that location good for getting around but that was before my accident. Ideally I would like to stay under 300GBP per night.

Hello    I know in general the tipping/gratuity culture is very different in UK (rest of the world) than the US and I know that restaurants will include service charge. My question is that since we will be travelling over the holidays Christmas Eve into New Year's Day and specifically will most likely be taking a taxi from Heathrow on Christmas Eve (late afternoon) to our hotel and New Year's Day from hotel to Heathrow. On Christmas Day we have a pre-paid jogging tour. *If* we choose to give a tip/gratuity for the service because after all it is a holiday it *should* be in cash right? So I should prepare some cash ahead of time?    Thanks agian! ,midorigal,London,Los Angeles...

Hello all! We are planning a family trip this winter and will be flying into Heathrow (from overseas) and staying at a family-friendly hotel beside Hearthrow. We are looking for help and suggestions on easy 'day trips' from a Heathrow area hotel while not having a car seat. We fly in and out of Heathrow and this is meant to be a 'long layover stop' while we get adjusted to the new time zone and also to do some exploring at a low-key pace.    We have 2 and 4 year old boys and part of the intent of our trip is to travel by train and bus (we are purposely not bringing car seats for travel convenience). We are also open to taxis or shuttles with safe options for young children.    My initial research suggests that a day trip to Windsor may be a nice idea however bus times are not ideal (with a transfer). We are also interested in going into London one day (likely via the Tube).    We anticipate being jet-lagged and don't want to go too far with the little ones but are definitely interested in small towns near Heathrow and want to ride a double decker bus.    Does anyone have any ideas/tips/suggestions for low-key child-friendly activities or destinations that are easily accessible from the Heathrow area?    Any information you can share is much appreciated! Thank you. ,Thomas M,London,"Calgary, Canada"
We are in the early planning stages of a third trip to the Emerald Isle next September but it will be our first time visiting Northern Ireland. Our rough itinerary will be driving to Belfast from somewhere near Dublin airport (won’t be visiting Dublin at all) 2 nights in Belfast 2 in Londonderry 1-2 nights somewhere else along the way (suggestions welcome !) and finally Galway for 2-3 nights before heading back to Dublin for a flight to Rome. We’ve had no problems driving on the left on our previous trips but we’ve always stuck to the WAW and small towns. Can anyone recommend accommodations in Belfast and Derry that have parking and are not complicated to get to from the motorway? If these cities are difficult to drive in we’d definitely consider staying somewhat outside the city and going in by taxi. Many thanks! ,Dianne B,Northern Ireland,"Ottawa, Canada"

Hi All    My daughter and I plan to travel to London this June and we would like to go from London to Hever Castle and then to Glastonbury and back to London. All without driving ourselves!    Which would be the best choice : train or a Bolt type service? From what I can gather the train would be a bit cumbersome with luggage and station switches but neither of us is familiar with Uber like rides. I know that trains are everywhere in England but there seem to be different “kinds”!! I don’t mind learning the Bolt app (or any others that might be better!) and clearly the drive is less time consuming than the train option. Does anyone have a clue how easily we might get a Bolt ride and perchance the approximate cost of London / Hever and either Hever / Glastonbury or London/ Glastonbury? Thank you so much!!! ,dejs,,Providenciales

Bit of a strange one but can't think of anywhere else to ask and can't get a direct contact to easyJet to find out.  We are flying from Edinburgh to Tenerife mid week roughly 3pm. We are able to get a lift to the airport but it will be a bit earlier than the bag drop advised of 2 hours before flight.  I fly out out Edinburgh quite a lot and from memory the bag drop is not flight specific and is just one big one shared amongst the various flights.  I should have asked the last time I was there but unfortunately forgot all about it.  Does anyone know or has flown recently and knows whether we can show up earlier than the 2 hours advised and drop the bags off earlier or although it's a shared bag drop it is still assigned per check in time?    For info we will likely be there around 11:30am for a 15:00 flight. Not a big deal if we have to hang around but was looking to book a lounge so it's to get a better idea of actual arrival time to departures.    TIA ,dr_wooo,Edinburgh,"Edinburgh, United..."
First off it's important to note that I will be buying a London Pass and so it's a bit different in terms of admission. I would normally wait to see the weather and make a game time decision but I will have to reserve weeks or months in advance. Also the pass is not good for evenings so there is a 5:15 last entrance for these. I was planning a late afternoon visit on a Wednesday. Anything that I should consider about what day/time I should book? ,baseball1951,London,San Francisco...
Hi someone is soon coming to visit me in London coming from EU. They are planning to bring food for personal use so I checked the food restrictions. Specifically there seems to be special rules about pork meat. On the official gov.uk website you can read the following:    You can only bring in pork or pork products over 2kgs if they’re either:    - commercially packaged with an EU identification mark  - stamped with a health mark if it’s a carcass    If you’re bringing in animal by-products they must be commercially packaged with the name and address of the feed business operator or have an animal by-product commercial document.    My question is: if the pork products ARE commercially packaged with an EU identification mark do I still have to declare them? ,Sergio S,England,
I'm sure there must be links to this question. Can anyone give me a link that gives public transport options? Thank you ,Scott8147,London,The Villages...
We are spending 3 nights in Stow on the Wold in Cotswolds end of July and hoping to go down to Mousehole Cornwall for 3 nights. We were originally thinking of renting a car from London and travelling around that way but I hear the traffic out of London is bad. So now we are thinking of going on the train to Cotswolds and hiring a car there to use for the 3 nights. Any ideas where we could rent a car from? Also any suggestions on how to get down to Cornwall from there? ,JuAucklandNewZealand,Cotswolds,Auckland New Zealand
Hi hoping someone can help in letting me know if I park up at Discovery car park at 3pm and pay for 10 hours if the machine will provide a ticket taking me to 3pm the next day?

I don't know if the machine works that way and handy to know ahead of parking when in Dundee this next week.  thanks in advance ,Sharon,Dundee,aberdeen
I lived in Edinburgh for many years and taxis used to drive into the covered station to pick people up at train level.  I arrived by train from London on Monday evening this week.  It was dark and pouring rain.  To get a taxi you have to go up to a walkway by elevator or escalator to exit on Market Street behind and above the station.  I couldn’t see any taxi rank and asked.  I was pointed to a tiny unlit sign along the busy road that said “Taxi Rank walk 120 yards this way.”  Dark street pouring rain narrow uneven sidewalk.  I had to ask again where to go and was directed across the street to a small sign.  No cross walk you just have to dash between the traffic in the dark to then stand on the other sidewalk.  There is no shelter at all while you wait.  None.  I was soaked my luggage was soaked.  I found it absolutely appalling that is people’s introduction to Edinburgh.  It’s unsafe for one thing.  All it needs is improved signage a crosswalk to stop traffic to get to the actual nearly invisible rank and an old bus shelter or similar to keep customers dry.  If any Edinburgh residents know who I can complain to….let me know! ,SMJ,Edinburgh,Canada

Be wary of using Sykes cottages. I booked a cottage in the Isle of Wight for Xmas 2013 for 10 members of my family back in in Jan of this year. Had a call from them at back end of Sept stating cottage was no longer available. They failed to find a suitable alternative & I am lumbered with ferry tickets and the task of finding something suitable at relatively short notice. This has fallen on deaf ears with Sykes who have no intention of remedying the situation. If you're going to deal with Sykes please be wary of them! ,Lutterworthcooper,,

Hi we are looking for a base for a few nights on the northern coast of Ireland in early March. Having a hard time deciding between these 3. Bushmills Inn and Bayview Hotel are nearly identical in price. The new Gray's at Bushmills (I think this used to be the Smugglers Inn) is also an option that is a tad bit less $ but not much.    We are looking for a hotel that has a nice bar/restaurant area to hang out in the evenings to people watch and relax. During the days we plan to do some light hiking in the Causeway areas Glens and around the Antrim coast. We may do a day trip to Derry as well. Oh and we will have a car.    Any recommendations on these hotels to sway me one way or the other?    Thanks! ,ARgat0r,Northern Ireland,Arkansas

Hello I'm planning for a family group of 4 two of whom are over 70 years old and not the keen on walking. We live in Australia thus have fabulous beaches and more interested in scenery gardens food and history.

Day 1  Drive from Bath to Cornwall - on the way –  - Bodmin Moor  – stop for lunch at Coombeshead Farm  - Treglyn Gardens    Stay St Ives    Day 2  Leisurely day St Ives  See Tate Gallery  eat @ Porthminster Café.  Stay St Ives    Day 3  Drive South East  Geevor Tin Mine & Mousehole  St. Michael’s Mount and Lizard Point    Stay Falmouth    Day 4  ???  Wander around Falmouth  Stay Falmouth    Day 5  Stay Falmouth  Lost Gardens of Heligan  Trebah Gardens  Pendinis castle  Falmouth maritime musuem    Day 6 - return to London  maybe Caerhays Castle and Cornish Gardens or visit this on  Day 4.

I know everyone recommends against getting an OC let alone a Visitor version but I have many reasons why I will happily be getting one. Having said that assuming that I cap out every day and I have a round trip from Heathrow to Southwark how much will I need to load over 8+ days?    The first day will be going from Heathrow to Southwark and then around Central London. Days 2-8 will be all over the place. And then on the 9th day I will go straight to Heathrow on a Saturday morning from Southwark. Any estimate on what that total will be?

I was only able to secure 2 adults 1 child ticket to climb Big Ben (wife will sit this one out so yes I had to pay an adult fare for a child) but unfortunately at noon (and have to be there at 11:30). I had originally planned a day in Mayfair but Big Ben was a priority. Is this doable and worth it?    Take public transportation to Abbey Road Studios and do what everybody does.    Take public transportation to Daunt Books.    Walk to Wallace Collection (opens at 10:00).    Leave Wallace Collection at 11:00 and take public transportation to Cromwell Entrance Parliament for 90 minute Big Ben tour.    Lunch.    We'll have a show that night so I didn't want to plan sightseeing afterward just in case. Obviously if we feel spry we can head back to Mayfair but I have a feeling a return to the flat to rest/cleanup may be in order. TIA. ,DaytonJG,London,"Centerville, Ohio"

Dinner    I assume we have to pick a specific time for our return tickets so any suggestions for the timing of that? I was thinking we would depart around 19:30. Would that give us enough time to eat at a casual restaurant? My goal is to not feel rushed yet avoid waiting around in Bath after dark in the winter with nothing to do....    Also how does that itinerary look for our group? Thanks in advance! ,travelfam7700,Bath,"Portland, Oregon"

Hi    My renewal is due in December 2024 so a year from now.    With the NHS surcharge fees going to be increased in Jan 2024 I'm wondering if I can apply to extend my visa now knowing that I won't be eligible for ILR due to time spent in the UK and I read the Extend Your Visa page on gov.uk a few times and it doesn't mention anything about applying earlier. https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa/extend-your-visa    Does anyone have experience applying earlier? I know it is a whole year earlier but it will save us £10K in NHS surcharges alone (We are a family of 5)    Thanks ,Hani,,
Hello. We are two women in our sixties. We will visit Edinburgh next May for 4 nights. We are looking for accommodation with a kitchenette for two adults. Our budget is limited (maximum of 200£ -£250 per night). It's possible ? What are our options? Thank you very much in advance for your help. ,Manon (albertoV05),Edinburgh,"Montreal, Canada"
Sorry about posting this given that there have been many requests for itineraries in this forum however none seem to cover what I’m looking for so I’m asking your help.  We are planning to visit Scotland in early June 2024 for about 7-10 days. We will be driving up from Liverpool and back down to London afterwards.  We are three fit adults. Not into golf or fishing. We enjoy seeing wonderful scenery - the lochs look beautiful as well as the rugged coastal areas and mountains.  I’d rather spend time in the countryside rather than the big cities hence the plan to hire a car.  My thoughts are to pick up to three towns to stay in and drive out each day to explore the local areas.    Can somebody suggest three areas that I could ‘hub’ from and possible towns in each? ,Reinor,Scotland,"Perth, Australia"
My daughter and I will be in London January 6 - 13 2024 and are thinking of seeing a show while we are there.    What is the dress code? Does it depend on the theater or show or is the dress code the same everywhere. We have not decided on the show but are considering Moulin Rouge or Phantom of the Opera. Would have liked to see Macbeth with David Tennant but looks like they sold out long ago.    Not planning on wearing jeans but wondering if nice corduroys/pants and dressy blouse and cardigan would work or if we we need to dress up more.    Thank you! ,NHMom67,London,"Concord, New..."

Hello Scotland experts thanks in advance for your guidance and advice. I am planning 9 nights in Scotland in late April. It will be at the end of four weeks throughout the UK. We are two women in our 60's really interested in history nature traditional music. Love walking/hiking (moderate or easy only). We'll rent a car. We will be coming over from Belfast so we'll start in Glasgow. Here's a very early rough itinerary that I'd love your thoughts on:    Glasgow - one night  to Oban on scenic road - two nights with day tour to Inner Hebrides (Mull Iona)  to Glencoe - two nights Glencoe Valley Drive some hiking  to Stirling with stop at Dunkeld or Falkland Village - both sound lovely. I do love the whole Stuart/Tudor history so Falkland sounds fun for that but maybe more out of the way?  Next day see Stirling Castle and then to Edinburgh for 3 nights    I didn't take us all the way north because I thought it would be very cold and it sounded like we could get a good taste of the Highlands in Glencoe. Is that right? And should we spend more time in Glencoe and forgo the Hebrides?    One more question one of us is a bridge lover and wants to see the Firth of Forth. How would we get out there from Edinburgh? Are there day trips? I see there are boat trips but you have to get to the launch maybe we can just take a cab? Appreciate your guidance.    thanks in advance!    Rebecca ,rebecca100,Scotland,"new york, new york"
Hello    I will be arriving at T4 and it's a bit stressful to know neither Heathrow Express nor the Piccadilly line operates that day. Any other public transportation available or what's the best way to go to the city center? Thanks. ,PG,London,
I am looking for a transport for 4 people from A Glasgow central hotel to Edinburgh airport. One way. Is this possible? ,Curious Jim,Scotland,
I've been reading up on public transportation costs and options in and around London. It appears that my best bet is to just use my phone for contactless entry when traveling on the tube given the daily/weekly caps (possibly the 7 day travel card added to it). I plan to get my 15 year old the Young Visitor discount when we arrive at LHR. However I'm confused about payment for trains.    Over the days we will be there we will be doing the following trips:  1) Heathrow to King's Cross (though will most likely do the tube for this not the train)  2) King's Cross to Hampton Ct  3) King's Cross to Windsor Castle  4) Euston to Watford for Harry Potter  5) Eurostar to Paris (I assume I just need to book this with Eurostar and that there is no rail pass combination available)    Can someone enlighten me on our best way to pay for the trips listed? Is there some type of discount plan/card or anything that we should be considering for these further out trips? Are they included in the Zones for the Oyster Card? Besides the Eurostar do I need to book train tickets in advance or are we ok to just show up when we want to travel?    Thanks for the help! ,Kris T,London,New York
We are planning a trip to Cotswolds possibly the end of May 2024. I read that since it is a holiday from May 27-31 many Londoners take holidays in the Cotswolds. Will it be too crowded?

Flying our of London on 28th May 2024 and I'm wondering if it is a good idea to book a hotel at Heathrow. We are leaving at 10.50am and I'm worried that the traffic in early morning peak hour could cause us a delay.  We are leaving from Terminal 2 but I'm happy to stay in a hotel near to and accessible to Terminal 2. Any recommendations as I'm not familiar with the layout of the airport and I'm ok walking or catching a shuttle.    How far in advance would we need to be at checkin for a flight to Munich.

Hi guys I would like to ask what would be the safe time gap between landing in London-Luton and departure of National Express to London Victoria (flight from Krakow Poland with wizzair landing 7:35 but as far as I can see there are a lot of little delays these days- I am traveling at then end of February)?I will have my backpack only no checked-in baggage.

Can anyone tell me what the parking situation is like at the Holyhead Ferry Terminal? I'll be getting the ferry to Dublin on New Year's Eve and I want to leave my car there until the next evening.    I'd prefer to pre-book or at least get an idea of the availability of the car park there. I've contacted Irish Ferries but they're not being very helpful they just say it's pay and display and they can't guarantee if there'll be a space.    I'd appreciate any thoughts or experience from anyone who's familiar with the ferry port.    Thank you. ,Lisa M,Holyhead,"Glasgow, United..."

Hi Londoners    We arrived 12/12 and staying in Shepherds Bush.  Have a 3.30pm booking for Harry Potter at Watford.  Any suggestions on what to do in the morning?

Will we have time for touristy things like Big Ben/ Buckingham Palace? Or markets etc? Also want to do more in daylight! It’s very wet and dark.  Thanks! ,Sujejo78,London,

Good morning there seems to be no direct train from Southampton to Bath Soa on Saturday 10th February 2024. The train that are available are 123 stops and very expensive compared to a direct train on say the monday after. Can I ask is it cheaper or better to catch a train from Southampton  to Westbury than the bus Westbury to Bath ( only a bus available) or catch a train to Reading or Basingstoke rom Southampton then a train to bath Spa all on separate tickets ??? I have researched all options and the southampton to Westbury then the bus seems to be the cheapest but not sure about rail buses in the UK. We are travelling from Australia.

Hello Wales experts. We are kicking off a trip to the UK in April with Wales specifically Llangollen. We're flying in to London so my thought was to take the train to Llangollen to see Plas Newydd spend two nights there then go to Holyhead and get the ferry to Dublin. But I'm not sure this works well without a car. Are there places we can stay that are near Plas Newydd or is it easy to get a taxi in Llangollen? And it looks like the trip to Holyhead is really long via train or bus so it's much better to get a car. Could I get a car with driver? Or is it really just better for me to do all this by car renting it out of London and dropping off at Holyhead? ,rebecca100,Wales,"new york, new york"

Have visited Buxton many times in the past few years and Ive fallen in love with it. I can't explain why really. I think it's how isolated it is as a small town or how contrasting the scenery is from the town to the gardens. Or maybe the Victorian or Georgian architecture? The place fascinated from the first time I went. Even just walking around the town. Would like to even move there one day. I really can't explain it. Anyone else feel like this ? ,Ken Harris,Buxton,
Hoping for some guidance here. We will be traveling to Scotland in Sept 2024 and will be starting and ending our trip in Edinburgh . Tentative itinerary: 4 nights in Edinburgh (to include a day trip to St. Andrews) and 3 nights in Skye. We will rent a car for the drive to Skye and likely make a stop at Stirling along the way. We have 2 extra nights that we can spend somewhere either on the way to Skye or on the way back from Skye. We are hoping for a varied experience during this trip and are stuck on where we should spend those 2 nights. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! We are active 65 yr olds enjoy history beautiful scenery raw nature and interesting downtowns with local fare and fun/educational tours. Thank you! ,marls00,Edinburgh,"Freehold, New Jersey"

Hi  I need help with figuring out my Itinery. I'm taking the train from London and I'm flexible with where I start in Scotland Edinburgh or Inverness. I know I want a few days in Edinburgh at the beginning or end of my trip but please give me some suggestions on places I can get to without a car where I can see nature quaint villages maybe coastal areas. I thought maybe plockton but read I'd need a car and that there wasn't much there to see or do. I'm stumped. Is my best bet to do day tours from Invetness? I thought of 3 day tours but they say the suitcase limit is 1 bag what would I do with my carryon? If you know of a fabulous must see place that I can get to by train and stay for a few days please advise. Thanks kindly 😀 ,Eileen J,,"Sidney, Canada"
Apologies to all this is Glasgow related but not travel related.    I am looking for information on an old building that is no longer there but I don't really know where to start. Hopefully one of our locals can point me to some resources or at least a starting point.    The building in question is one of the three grand Scottish Co-operative Society buildings on Morrison street. Two of them are thankfully still there but one of them (between Laidlaw st and Paterson st) was demolished some time ago and that's the one I'm interested in. I worked there for the Co-op bank as a young lad and almost 50 years on I'm curious to find out more about the building.

We will be in London in April 2023 and are trying to figure out if we should do a train or plane from London to Brussels (taking a river cruise out of Brussels.) Have things improved at Heathrow as far as luggage and security wait times? Would it make more sense to take a train even though it takes a little longer but perhaps I don't need to check in as early? Not sure how long before a flight I should check in for a flight from London to Brussels and want to make sure my luggage makes it. I am trying to maximize my time in London (staying at Hyatt Regency Churchill) and since train station closer than airport leaning towards a train. Taking a train requires a connection to get into Brussels Grand Place area whereas if we fly into Brussels we can take a train straight to Brussels. Just curious what experienced travelers would recommend. Cost is about the same it seems. Train gives us a lot more options as far as timing. ,coloradowahine,London,"Denver, Colorado"

Hi there. We are considering a trip from Feb 17 to 26 with our teens. My husband and I have been to London a few times but this would be our teens first trip to a metropolitan like London.

We'd have 8 full days. Are these good day trip options with teens ?  - Stonehenge Windsor Castle  - Cotswolds Oxford  - Harry Potter/Warner Bros Studios  I really want to visit Cambridge and Shakespeare's birth place as well but not sure how we can fit those into a day trip that includes places above?

I've been told by Trainline to collect my tickets at a UK train station (any of the 1700) but I am abroad and I can't collect my tickets until I arrive in the UK.  This is the best bit there is a note in my booking saying I cannot collect tickets at Newcastle airport so how do I get them and why weren't they issued digitally if the airport station doesn't have a collection machine?  Or does this mean I can't collect inside the airport building but they are available once I reach the metro platform?  Frustrated sorry! ,Stephen O,Newcastle upon Tyne,North Yorkshire...

What is the best way to see England in seven days in August? ,Nishanthie R,England,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hi All    Solo traveler like visiting new places and plan to visit UK end of August. I will head to London  but plan to take a detour via Leeds + York. Can I stay in Leeds and visit York 2 days back to back? Sample itinerary planned is below:    23/08: Arrive from Dublin to Leeds Bradford by 15:00  23/08: Leeds-Bradford to Leeds City Centre. roam Leeds City Centre (maybe take a walking tour)  24/08: Take a bus to York early morning tour York and return by evening bus to Leeds  25/08: Take a bus to York early morning and return in the evening OR tour more of Leeds take evening bus to London    Key points:    - I don't have a specific aim/list yet for either location just new places so open to suggestions and I will chalk out the must see things  - Reason for stay in Leeds is York is pretty expensive. Even factoring the bus cost it saves me 40 euros + Also would see key spots in Leeds    Any advise would be much appreciated ,Wandererr84,Leeds,"Dublin, Ireland"
Dear experienced travelers    We three Malaysian ladies are contemplating two exciting travel itineraries for a 22-day trip next year and seek your expertise in making the best choice: (A) Central Europe covering Budapest Slovenia Austria-Salzburg & Vienna Munich-Black Forest  and Prague or (B) exploring Scotland and scenic small towns in England near Scotland.    As nature enthusiasts fond of easy hiking and admiring picturesque small towns we're drawn to unique Western architecture but not particularly keen on museums planning to visit only a select few. Our accommodation preference is hostels or Airbnb. This will be our first time in these countries and our initial planning phase has just begun. Also we're inexperienced in driving on the left side intending to rely on public transport for Central Europe and considering driving for Scotland.    Our queries for your invaluable insights are:    1. For Central Europe particularly Slovenia Hungary Austria -Salzburg and Croatia is it feasible to primarily utilize buses or trains?    2. Could you recommend charming English small towns near Scotland that are worth visiting?    3. Regarding weather conditions and views for short walks would May or September be a more favorable time to travel?    4. In terms of travel expenses which option tends to be more budget-friendly: Central Europe or Scotland?    We sincerely welcome any advice or recommendations from seasoned travelers or locals to help us decide on the best option.    Thank you for your valuable feedback! ,Malaysian Wanderers,,"Ipoh, Malaysia"
We will be arriving Friday evening into terminal 3 and leaving very early (6am flight) on Sunday morning from terminal 5. We would like to spend the day Saturday in London itself - most likely using Hoho bus for the day.

Hello everyone. My teenage daughter will be arriving around midnight at T5 and will have to spend the night between flights at a hotel near the airport.

Hello! My husband and I will be traveling to Scotland in spring/summer of 2024 for a bit over 2 weeks (including travel days) and would love some input on our current itinerary! We are big into hiking/nature activities small villages castles good food. I'm also a huge fan of Harry Potter and Outlander :)    Questions:    1. For the first 2 days we are torn between basing out of Inverness Aberdeen or Perthshire. Inverness is appealing mainly because its closer to our next stop Isle of Skye. Aberdeenshrie appeals to me for the castle trail and a shorter drive after our long flight from the US. Perthshire is even closer and has St Andrews but not sure if that's worth visiting if you don't plan to golf (though Fife in the same area looks beautiful). Would love any thoughts here!    2. If we do choose Aberdeenshire any recommended stops on the way to Skye to break up the drive? Looking at the map it seems like we will be able to stop in Inverness but would loves some more hidden gems We'd be willing to drive slightly out of the way for the right attractions :)    3. Better to base out of Fort William and just day trip to Glencoe? Seems like there are more lodging options in Fort William but the scenery in Glencoe looks spectacular.    4. Is it worth actually riding the Jacobite train? Seems like that would eat up most of a day - would our time be better spent on other things in that area?    5. Any general feedback on the itinerary!    ITINERARY    Day 0 Depart USA  Day 1 Arrival drive to Aberdeenshire OR Perthshire OR Inverness  Day 2 Aberdeenshire  Day 3 Aberdeenshire > Isle of Skye  Day 4 Isle of Skye  Day 5 Isle of Skye  Day 6 Isle of Skye  Day 7 Skye > Glencoe/Fort William  Day 8 Glencoe/Fort William  Day 9 Glencoe/Fort William  Day 10 Glencoe > Isle of Mull  Day 11 Glencoe > Isle of Mull  Day 12 Isle of Mull > Edinburgh  Day 13 Edinburgh  Day 14 Edinburgh  Day 15 Edinburgh  Day 16 Travel Home    Thanks so much for reading and for any feedback! ,Alexandra,Scotland,"Chicago, Illinois"
I’ll be flying back to the States through LGW. I fly in on a Thursday around 1400 from Lisbon and don’t depart until 1000 the next morning. I’m planning on getting a hotel around LGW that night since I’ll want to be up relatively early.    I have done some searches and I’m trying to decide whether to go to London and see some sights before returning to LGW area or go to Brighton and explore there. I will be traveling alone with only a carry on and backpack. My plan is to drop my luggage off at the hotel and then go out. I don’t think I could get to Brighton in time to see the Royal Pavilion and I live in California so the beach/sea isn’t as big of a draw. I have never been to the UK either so seeing the sights would be nice. My wife and I plan on making a trip to the UK eventually but I’m not sure how long it will be before that trip. ,Dan,,Los Angeles...

Question - Where can we go that is only a few blocks away from the hotel that will not be overrun with huge crowds? I know I'm asking alot being that it's NYE.

I'm planning a couples' trip for my 50th birthday. I like quirky golf courses fly fishing hiking pubs and architecture. The group I'm going with will probably ditch me while I golf and fish so finding places to stay with things for them to do is key.    Flying in and out of Edinburgh for a day or two at the Festival    Playing St. Andrews and might have to stay there to wait for a tee time.    Stay in Aberdeen to play Cruden Bay and maybe fish River Dee    Stay in Inverness to play Nairn and/or fish River Ness    Heard great things about Skye Mallaig and Fort William on the way back?    Clearly this is too much for an 8 day trip. What would you take out or replace? Cheers. ,Colby L,Scotland,

We are planning a visit March 23-29 2024 for our family of 4 with 2 teens (16 and 19). We are putting lists of priorities together and I'm specifically wondering about the need for pre-booking tickets. We want to make sure to do so for any top priorities where it seems necessary but would prefer to keep as much time flexibility as we can by not pre-booking where it isn't necessary.    We know we need to pre-book for the Harry Potter Studios and I think it is also highly recommended for the Churchill War Rooms.    We are wondering about any of these other places that say you can pre-book tickets. How necessary is it?  Kensington Palace  Imperial War Museum  Natural History Museum  Handel and Hendrix House Museum  Westminster Abbey    And then it looks like in March the House of Parliament will likely only be open for tours on Sat March 23rd. Do we need to pre-book those tickets?    I think that March 29 will be a holiday for Good Friday? Should we anticipate that impacting hours or crowds of anywhere we plan to visit? ,Natalie T,London,Minneapolis...

I have read a lot about the red buses for tourists. It seems on here that people don't generally recommend them saying they get held up in traffic and are expensive. I am torn because people I know here who have been to London recommend them and my travel agent also recommended them. Does the expense offset the convenience for a tourist who has limited time in London and knows nothing about your fair city? Do your regular city buses not get stuck in the same traffic? How easy is it for a tourist unfamiliar with your city to walk out and hop on these regular buses. What travel pass do you need and where do you purchase same. This may seem like the most basic question but I trying to figure out how we approach our couple of days in London city. We travel early May 2024 and are staying in Camden.

Myself and my wife will be in Glasgow later this week. We'll be spending most of our time in the centre but are planning a couple of trips further afield using public transport. I've been looking at the options and I think I know what to do but would welcome any feedback.  On one day I will be making three separate solo trips on the subway. I see that a day ticket will be cheaper for this £4.20. I presume I will have to buy a ticket from the desk on the first platform. No tap on/tap off facility with a daily cap?  On a different day we will both be travelling together to Braehead shopping centre from the city centre and back. I have seen buses 901 906 X7 X23 will provide this service. Are all these buses operated by McGills? I see that a duo saver is available at a cost of £9.00. Does this operator take part in the £2 per bus journey scheme if so that would be cheaper by £1.  We are both pensioners with English bus passes but I assume they are no use north of the border.  Thanks in advance. ,briwire,Glasgow,"Warrington, United..."

My car isn't ULEZ compliant and I need to fly from Heathrow. There is planned rail work on the dates I need to travel so I can't travel by train. Having a look at the ULEZ map Colne which is just off the M25 and is outside ULEZ has a bus service that goes to Terminal 5 and takes about 15 minutes. I don't know the area but it looks like it's a smallish village and there should be on street parking or a car park there.  Potters Bar station is another option I am looking at as well as parking is cheaper than Heathrow and then it's a relatively cheap train journey to Heathrow (the planned work is North of Potters Bar)  I'm just wondering if anyone else has any outside the box ideas where one could park cheaply (cheaper than the official airport parking anyway) and then use public transport to get to the airport and also avoid the ULEZ fee? ,John L,London,

We just got back from 9 days in Scotland: 3 nights – Edinburgh 2 nights – Aviemore 2 nights Portree 1 night Edinburgh. It was fantastic!! This was our second trip with an outstanding Blue Badge guide Miles Forde https://guidedscotland.co.uk/ . As we planned he made sure we understood the advantages – beautiful light and locations and completely uncrowded. And also the potential disadvantages: limited hours of daylight many tourist sites closed and perhaps inclement weather. We had fantastic weather. An advantage of limited daylight is that we were able to fully enjoy the sunrise and sunsets. And nature was open and that's what mattered to us. Below are just a few highlights of our trip – we truly had awe inspiring moments. Like all trips ours was highly idiosyncratic to our interests. We wanted to absorb nature take walks take nice photos and look at birds and wildlife and learn some history and we did!    If taking a trip at this time of year I would strongly recommend working with a talented guide. Miles found stunningly beautiful spots for walks and picnics and bird watching and history that we never would have found on our own. He maximized the many strengths of Scotland in November.    Day 1 – Edinburgh and stayed at Bonham hotel – excellent!  Arrived afternoon – Botanics Christmas Market and some of the 44 Scotland Street series areas near our hotel.    Day 2 -Edinburgh  -We hiked up Arthur’s Seat. Fun even with strong winds at the top (I did this hike as a kid and wanted to do it again). Our guide has a passion for the outdoors and is an avid hiker – thank goodness I could not have managed the end in the wind without him.  -Duddingston Loch – I have never seen larger swans in my entire life.  -National Gallery on the Mound – We looked at Scottish Landscape art. Really fun to see the landscapes as they were painted then and see them now! A different way of looking at art.    Day 3 – The Borders  -A highlight of trip was going to visit The Great Tapestry of Scotland in Galashiels! Don't miss it!  -Lots beauty moments in the Borders.  -On the way back birdwatching in Musselburgh -really fun. We wanted to learn more about birds and we did!  -Fancy dinner in Edinburgh at Prestonfield House Rhubarb - excellent!    Days 4/5 – Aviemore – Stayed at Cairngorm Hotel  -Loch Levan RSPB! We had never been in a hide before very cool!  -We had two days for jaw dropping awe! So many highlights! On our way to Aviemore we went for a walk at the Hermitage. Loch Morlich had incredible light and reflections. We also went to some small lochs that had absolutely unbelievable reflections like we had never seen before. We are ruins fans so we went to Ruthven Barracks. We were speechless for two days. Awesome!    Days 6/7- Portree – stayed at Cuillin Hills Hotel – excellent!  We had never been Skye and we had it to ourselves - we went all over Trotternish area took lots of walks. Of course Eilean Donan castle. Too many great moments to list  -One of the many highlights of the trip: Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls. It was just the three of us at the overlook. It was quite windy and in beautiful morning sunlight. At the bottom of the falls was a beautiful rainbow. The railings have holes in the tops and with the wind blowing there was beautiful New Age-like music created! Unbelievable!  -When we were taking a walk at Quiraing we commented that there were people there with us (smile)– four cars – our guide was too nice to laugh at us as in the summer it is apparently packed.  -Fun hike at Fairy Glen – Up to the top of Castle Ewen. Visited Flora MacDonld’s grave – what a beautiful location!    Day 8 – Back to Edinburgh via Glencoe and Rannoch Moor – just stunning!  -And we stopped at the Kelpies at night! Then as rush hour traffic rushed past us as we were going into Edinburgh we stopped and got to see three of Jupiter’s moons and Saturn with its ring – super clearly through a telescope! Another major highlight! ,Mildred_K,Edinburgh,Los Angeles...

Hi there! Our accommodation will be walking distance to the cheese barge and our family loves cheese. Our kids will be 8&10 and are quite fond of all sorts of exotic and stinky cheeses. Is the general vibe kid friendly?

Hi all i am in an initial stage of planning for a UK trip for Dec 2024. We had always preferred self driving for convenience and to better explore the areas we’re visiting also to save costs. There will be 5 of us (3 teenagers) and the trip has to be in mid Dec. Please let me know which option makes better sense    Option 1  - flight to Manchester (Old Trafford Stadium - soccer fan thing). Stay a night or 2  - self drive down to a cottage homestay need suggestion for a base for about 4 nights where we can visit Stonehenge Bath Oxford Salisbury Bicester village.  - drop off car before we reach London central  - Paris for 3 or 4 nights  - train back to London for another 3 nights or so before flight home      Option 2  - flight to manchester  - flight to paris for 3/4 nights stay  - train to london  - pick up car for the same self drive trip to a cottage homestay need suggestion for a base for about 4 nights where we can visit Stonehenge Bath Oxford Salisbury Bicester village.  - train to London central for another 3/4 nights before flight home    2nd option seems to make better sense for me also taking into consideration its winter but we will miss the joy of driving and the stop overs that we wld have enjoyed if we’d go for the 1st option. ,n.j.,,"Singapore, Singapore"

Suggestions are gatwick to st Pancras. Would that be OK and where do I walk to get to euston or can I get a taxi? Would I have to buy another ticket even though I have one via London Bridge? ,Sephora M,,"Manchester, United..."
Do NOT deal with this car hire company or their partner Drivalia. They have a number of sneaky clauses that enable them to charge you additional so-called admin fees of 55 pounds or more if you receive an infringement from a council or police. All they do is email you these infringements - about 30 seconds work. Its also very doubtful if these so-called infringements are actually legitimate - they appear bogus that Easirent fabricate in order to charge their admin fees. If you value your money STAY WAY FROM EASIRENT and DRIVALIA. ,John F,England,"Brisbane, Australia"

I received a lot of help on the Forum when planning our July trip last summer to Berkshire Richmond East Sussex and Kent.I thought I'd post the first of several day's worth of reports on how it all went starting with Windsor and Kew Gardens and travelling to Mickleham.    Our tour also included Hever Castle Sissinghurst Scotney Bodiam Bateman's Leeds Castle Rye village Canterbury Cathedral and Audley End.    My husband and I both absolutely loved this trip. The majority of places were stunning and we were blessed with mostly excellent weather to enjoy them.    I always write trips up in my blog site so I've posted the link to Day 1 below with photos to relieve my often too wordy musings on what we saw and experienced.

Hello everybody. I am coming to Scotland with my family for the second time and will spend 4 weeks in 5 different airbnbs around the country. Last year we flew to Manchester and hired a car from arnoldclrak and drove to our first Airbnb in Scottish borders. This time (next week) we are flying to Edinburgh. Arnoldclrak at Edinburgh airport is more expensive than other companies at the airport. I searched and found a good deal with Avis but then read some bad reviews on google. I kept checking rates and last week I found a good deal with Drivalia. Most of their reviews seem to be good although I read that they used to have another name and that there were lots of complaints about them. This new company seems better.    As I am traveling with my wife and 3 kids and carrying 4 medium sized suitcases I really don’t want any unpleasant surprises.    I am seeking advice from people who have dealt with both Avis and Drivalia. Which one do you think I should stick to? Both bookings are free cancellation and booked cars are similar in size.    Avis is a bit more expensive.    it’s 5:12 p.m here and it’s 40 degrees outside. We are really looking forward to this holiday.    Thank you in advance. ,Alyarubi,Edinburgh,"Muscat, Oman"

Hi all  I’m quite interested in hearing for anyone who knows how airport service charges work.    I purchased a return flight between Gatwick and Athens from Wizz Air for just £31 RETURN.    Now what I just cannot understand is this.    I searched for the same route on the on British Airways Fare Calculator and was presented with the following information.    “  Adult 1  Item Price of item  Fare £82.00  Carrier imposed charge £18.00  Air Passenger Duty - United Kingdom £13.00  Passenger Service Charge - United Kingdom £21.79  Airport Development Charge - Greece £10.30  Passenger Terminal Facility Charge - Greece £13.70  Passenger Security Charge - Greece £4.30”      The fare BA would charge was over £163    Now I assume that BA can’t just be the only airline that has to pass these charges onto their passengers.    Yet I just DO NOT understand how on earth Wizz Air can make a profit based on charging £31 for a return flight?!?    The Air Passenger Duty is surely mandatory so that’s £13 + €12. Let’s say that’s about £22.    Do Wizz Air passengers also have to pay the £21.79 ‘Pssenger Servive Charge’ to Gatwick Airport? Or the Greek (Athens) Airport charges (totalling over £28). If so Wizz Air would be LOSING £40 on taking me to Athens and back.    It just does not make sense to me.    Are budget airlines exempt from the same airport charges as legacy carriers such as BA or have they negotiated a lower rate? Do budget airlines pay the same level of Air Passenger Duty as airlines such as BA?    If so how can they survive? ,Jason,London,United Kingdom

Hi all. We have two nights to spend and fly out early morning from Heathrow. Could anyone advise a nice area to stay with teenagers without going to London.

Hi all  Apologies if this is in the wrong forum. But I have a complimentary chauffeur booking with Emirates because I happen to be flying business class; my flight arrives at 11.40am and I've sent a request for the chauffeur at 12.00pm recognising that there is a 30 minute waiting period. I'm a little bit confused though as to whether I should reschedule for later. They do say they monitor flights for delays but does that mean they will arrive 20 minutes after the flight lands and so I have about 50 minutes to get through all the security/customs etc.?    If I do need to reschedule it or anything (or if I'm likely to have to pay a waiting fee) please let me know. But really I guess I'm just after any advice/help regarding this that anyone can provide.    TIA :) ,Lachlan S,London,"Brisbane, Australia"
So I've been trying to get travel insurance for a trip that is starting on the 13th of this month.    I've also been talking about the possibility that I might have ADHD with my doctors for quite some time.    As it turns out a lot of insurers won't give you insurance if you have any conditions that are under investigation but have not been diagnosed.    This very frustrating because I really genuinely don't know if I have ADHD or not and so it could be that the symptoms that are under investigation have nothing at all to do with a medical condition and are just scatty aspects of my personality!    Also I'm not actually officially on any waiting lists for this just talking to my doctor but it looks like for a lot of policies that is enough for them not to want to cover you.    Anyway I have no idea what to do now because I can't seem to get insurance. I've only managed to find a couple companies that have said they will cover me but they both seem to have pretty sketchy reputations when you look for reviews online.    I don't know what to do! Does anyone out there know about any decent medical insurers? I guess probably the only company that would end up insuring me would be a medical insurers... it's just preferable that they are a decent one!    Best Wishes  Raquel ,Willow0303,,
Hi    We have to be at Stansted airport at 11.00 a.m. on Sunday December 31st. As we will be staying close to Russell Square station we're loathe to drag big heavy suitcases by tube to Liverpool Street station in order to get the Stansted Express. We don't want to try to hail a cab on the street so are thinking of pre-boking a taxi to the station. Can anybody advise us how to do this? Or is it possible to make a call and get a taxi right away like we can do here in Norway?    I've looked into a car service all the way to Stansted but Blackberry Cars whom we successfully used to Heathrow a number of years ago charge all of £120. I expect that other car services won't be any cheaper. We're hoping that the taxi/train combination will cost considerably less.    Thanks in advance for advice and recommendations! ,Catwoman02,London,Norway
Arriva buses in the Shropshire and Telford bus zone repeatedly drive past students and other members of the public when not even close to capacity. The public are dependent on these buses to get home but how can they be when the buses won't even stop for them.    I am disabled and so am entitled to priority seating but how can bus drivers know this? I suffer from a hidden disability and am often left stranded in the cold and wet unable to sit down having to wait exorbitant amounts of time for another bus. And them I am home late and in severe pain.    Needless to say the rest of my day is a write off.  Arriva - do better. ,Rose G,Shropshire,

Hi I just came up with an idea that might sound crazy to fly into London for 48hrs on 24th December evening and fly back home in the evening of the 26th (we live very close so flight is only 1.5hrs for us). Time is short because of work requirements so unfortunately we couldn't stay longer than that we have already visited the city in the past so this is not really for sightseeing but just to spend a different Christmas in a beautiful place. Most likely we would be flying into London City Airport and flying back from Heathrow and probably stay the 2 nights in a hotel near Covent Garden. My question is mainly regarding transport I read that on the 25th no public transport is running so just wondering if being there those days would be ruined for that reason or too expensive to run just with taxis to cover longer distances and transporto to/from airports..

Hi everyone! I have a question sparked after another recent thread about coffee.  In my experience in London I have realized that not many breakfast/brunch places will offer brewed coffee whether classic cafetière American brew or more alternative styles (thinking of V60 and AeroPress). The only place I have encountered so far during so many trips is Abuelo in Covent Garden (which is very good and I recommend thoroughly) and I have seen that the Dean Street Townhouse does brewed coffee too but other than that do you have any specific suggestions?    Location-wise I am open to pretty much anywhere in North East and Central London. Thank you in advance.    Cheers  K. ,Kuroneko_89,London,"Rome, Italy"

We are going to be reserving tickets for the Harry Potter Studio Tour for the end of March and I'm trying to figure out total travel time in order to order our timed tickets.    We are staying near the Waterloo Station. It looks like we will take Waterloo to Euston and then Euston up to Watford Junction. The website says that leg takes about 20 minutes. And then we have the bus shuttle.    Considering that we will be unfamiliar with the train at Euston station so many need a little extra time to navigate how much time should we estimate overall to do the full journey? Are we safe getting timed tickets about 1 hour after we will want to leave our hotel? ,Natalie T,London,Minneapolis...

Dear London Experts  My family of 4 will be traveling to London from 3/24-3/29 and staying at the Marriott Canary Wharf to use up points and book 2 rooms.

In planning our Scotland trip so far we are doing a 3 night trip on a converted fishing boat from Oban but also plan on renting a car and driving around the highlands.  Given that the Highland time is something like 4-5 days would you include Skye? the guidebooks all say it’s a “don’t miss” but sometimes the practicalities say otherwise :)  Also if we rent in Glasgow or Edinburgh it looks like the car has to be returned there?? I know there’s no drop off in Oban wondering if there are any closer options than going from Highlands back to cities and training it to Oban.  any advice much appreciated! ,Suzy Cayenne,Scotland,
We are a group of 6 people and plan to travel from London to Scotland and back in 10 days in July 24. We would like to hire a 7 or 9 seater car for this travel.

Hi: We are planning a 5-night stay in London and it is our first time visiting. I just started the overwhelming task of looking for a hotel and would greatly appreciate some expert input. We walk a lot but would still like to be centrally located and close to a tube station. We are looking for a comfortable convenient hotel with a good breakfast. A nice view and rooftop bar would be a plus but not necessary. We often book boutique hotels but have found that we prefer larger hotels in European cities for comfort during days of busy sightseeing. Our budget is $350 to $450 USD per night.

Any idea of price of above for 1 person    Thank you ,jmo777,Luton,United Kingdom
We want to write this as a warning to anyone who books here. We booked our stay here through HOSTELWORLD yesterday. We were presented with a price of roughly £200. After paying we immediately (within 10 minutes) were billed for close to £1100. These were both taken directly from our bank account. It turns out that HOSTEL WORLD collects some sort of commission and that they only displayed the commission price and not the actual total. We were charged 2 payments one from Hostel World and another from Wombats.    We immediately contacted both Wombat & Hostelworld (within 15 minutes of booking). Wombat has ignored our emails and are not responding whatsoever. Hostel World basically said Too bad too sad. Should have read the fine print.    After reading a little bit more it turns out that Hostel World is known for this scam. They display a price very different when you are booking but then put the actual price very small and hidden. If you look of HOSTEL WORLD SCAM on google you will find many people discussing this same issue. Please see the attached images I have included on my tripadvisor review on Wombats page.    As for Wombat's they are complacent in this scam as well. They have access to the same knowledge that we do in regards to Hostel World's less than ethical system and still are registered with them. Wombat's could simply say that they are not affiliated with them however my credit card was charged by WOMBATS own internal system within 15 minutes of making this reservation. This means that they are working directly with Hostel World.    Wombats is fully aware of this system and yet they still continue to affiliate and pay commissions to Hostel World.    The fact that they ignore my emails is also telling of this situation in that it must not be surprising to them.    Hostel World is a commission collecting 3rd party company that will charge your credit card immediately upon booking for amounts that don't necessarily match their advertising rates.    I guess Wombats could comment here saying it's better to book directly with them which is probably the case but this does not address the fact that they continue to work with a company that is specifically deceptive in it's core business model.    Again please google search Hostel World Scam and be sure to read through the reviews. Also be sure to read through all of the negative before booking.    Also be aware that Wombats does not message you back in regards to this.    I have attached screenshots of the the prices that are listed on the their website and the actual price I paid. These are on my Wombats review on their tripadvisor page.    Beware of this. ,J. Shaffer,,

Hi all    Very early planning stages here so please bear with me if this doesn't make much sense practically speaking.    We (2 adults 2 kids 11 & 12) will be in London for about a week then plan to visit Hadrian's Wall (it was the one very specific request from kids!).    I thought we could take an early morning train to Newcastle then hire a car so we can visit Housesteads Vindolanda and do some walking and general sight-seeing. We would have 3 nights so two full days to devote to the area.    For the last day would it be feasible to drop the car back into Newcastle and then take the Transpennine Express to Manchester to transfer to the airport for a late evening flight out (back to Aus)?    Alternatively we could do two nights in/near Hexham then one night between that area and Manchester and drop the car/transfer to airport etc all on that last afternoon.    Like I said this is very rough planning but hopefully someone will be able to say yep that'll work or nope try this instead and then I can be more thorough with details. If it impacts anything this would be roughly mid-April.    Thanks in advance! ,daffstarring,Northumberland,Queensland...

Being a cyclist with a tent (but not the smallest tent since it can accommodate 2-3 people) I'll be visiting the Shetland islands for about two-three weeks in July. So I'll be able to visit a good deal of local sights maybe from 5-6 places but probably not the smallest islands. I've already done research on the available 'real' camping sites. But I also like to do some wild camping at times when visiting coastal areas in Scotland and Northern Europe; am a considerate person regarding waste polite and discreet.    If anyone has any good information regarding some options/recommended places I'd be happy to receive it; maybe via PM. I might pay a few £ if needed on sites. The terrain appears barren with only few roads or tracks making it not so easy to find suitable places on a map from one's armchair ... also houses seem spread out a lot and local terrain owners will perhaps difficult to find when arriving ... ? ,joen.dk,Shetland Islands,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
Hello    We are coming to London between Christmas and New Year’s primarily to see shows. We usually go to NYC every two years to see Broadway shows around the holidays but this year we had flight credits that was due to expire and we’ve only been to London once in 2007. Last time we did see a lot of sights so this time we wanted to see shows and Christmas lights!    Here’s our plan so far:    12/24-land in the afternoon; taxi to Montague on the Gardens; I looked into pre-booking a car service; Black Cars are charging a 50% premium due to the holidays; I know the tube will be faster and direct; if my luggage is light I will go this route; dinner booked at hotel    12/25-been warned that London is pretty much shut down; tube closed; booked an morning jogging tour; booked Festive Afternoon Tea at Brown’s Hotel; as for breakfast am hoping will have picked up something the night before packed protein bars or maybe picked up something at the market/Chinatown after the jogging tour?    12/26-not sure what do to during daytime walk around? I see most (all?) museums are closed due to Boxing Day are Department Stores closed too or have sales started? Booked Festive Afternoon Tea at Claridge’s Hotel. Operation Mincemeat Musical at the Fortune at night.    12/27-Matinee show of Christmas Carol at the Old Vic excited to hear they pass out oranges and mince pie! Dinner rez at Gunpowder then Guys and Dolls at the Bridge Theatre. Something to do in the morning/lunch near the Old Vic that makes sense? I know my husband would love some fish and chips or visit a pub.    12/28-Matinee show of My Neighbor Totoro at the Barbican. Dinner rez at Tandoor Chop House then Back to the Future at the Adelphi Theatre. I was thinking of getting Skygarden tickets for the morning. Any recommendations for eating lunch or grabbing a quick bite around the Barbican before the matinee show?    12/29-Evening show of The Witches at the National Theatre. Since we have the whole day free we wanted to devote it to the V&A Museum. When I was there last I barely saw anything as I was so enthralled by the Kylie Minogue exhibition. Of course this time I want to see the Chanel exhibition I understand it’s all sold out. Although since I want to see the DIVA exhibition too and if I add the cost together if I purchase a membership it looks like we’ll be able to see both and won’t require a booking. So that’s my plan. The location of V&A also looks close to Harrods so perhaps we can also drop in to look at the food hall and get some food. I don’t have plans/reservation for lunch/dinner that day.    12/30-British Museum in the morning; mainly to see the Elgin Marbles. Matinee show of Peter Pan Panto at the London Palladium. Dinner rez at Masala Zone then evening show of Crazy for You at Gillian Lynne.    12/31-Lunch rez at Dishroom; matinee show of Stephen Sondheim’s Old Friends at Gielgud. Afterwards? Pick-up something as takeaway to eat for dinner and return to hotel? NYE will get very crazy? Watch fireworks on TV?    1/1-return home    I also want to see Christmas lights. Am really hoping will just “happen” to see it as we are out and about or maybe I need to make more of an effort?    As you may also see by the reservations I made it’s heavily Indian food focused it’s one of my husband’s favorite and he doesn’t get much of a chance to eat it here so I’m making a special concession for him as he is for me by going to festive tea 2x! It would be great to get some fish and chips and/or pub recommendations though! Or any other bits of advice.    Thank you! ,midorigal,London,Los Angeles...

My family recently spent one night in Fort William as we were traveling back from the Isle of Skye towards Edinburgh. After dinner we walked to the grocery store to pickup a few items then proceeded to walk back towards our hotel. A large group of teenage boys began to follow us. At one point they started throwing things at us and hit my daughters in the back with something. We kept walking and made it to the touristy area of town at which point they stopped following us. This was an alarming incident for my children and I realize this can happen anywhere but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced issues in Fort William or if we were just unlucky? I'd hate to think I put my kids in danger because I missed some warning about crime in the area. ,Jeremy J,Fort William,Ellicott City...

Hello my husband and I are planning a long weekend in Snowdonia for his birthday next year in late June. We have pulled together some ideas for an itinerary but I'd be interested to see if there's anything else you'd suggest?    We will be travelling up on the evening after work so we can make the most of our time off. We're fit & active in our mid 30s. We enjoy hiking and being busy / doing something active. So plan wise we were thinking:    DAY ONE  This will be my husband's birthday and he wants it to be quite active and busy. We were thinking of going to Zipworld in the morning (he has been before and loved it I've not yet been) and in the afternoon arrange to canoe over The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.    DAY TWO  Walks & exploring - in particular we were thinking of walking around Llyn Efyrnwy and also driving over to Stwlan Dam for an explore as we thought it looks quite interesting.    DAY THREE  We're thinking of walking up Snowdon. I know it gets very busy these days; I've done Snowdon before but my husband. We are keen hikers generally and we're building on our fitness ready for 2 weeks in the Dolomites next year so Snowdon will be one of many training hikes we're planning.    DAY FOUR  Casual morning before the 5 hour drive back home    Really interested if you'd recommend something else instead of the above or any other thoughts. Thank you :) ,WeLoveTravel.in,Snowdonia-Eryri National Park,"Portsmouth, United..."

Just after ideas to get legs moving get some fresh air and enjoy a day before continuing with travel.      Thank you :) ,Rebecca M,London,"Brisbane, Australia"

So this time we'll be dog free and we want to do city touring and make the most of doing things we can't normally do with a dog in tow.    We originally planned 1 night in Glasgow and 2 in Edinburgh but then found out Taylor Swift is playing in Edinburgh that weekend. So now we're thinking we may just do a day trip to Edinburgh on the train. We won't have a car so things need to be easily reached on foot within Glasgow or within easy reach of train but I'm looking for ideas please of things to do/ places to go that we couldn't normally do when we holiday with a dog.    We're early 50s we like live music comedy good wine city tours distillary tours hearty food (not fine dining).    Thanks in advance for any ideas. ,JTM1705,Glasgow,Manchester
Hello Fellow Travellers    1. I will be visiting London from 17 to 25 May 24 (both dates inclusive).    2. My tentative itinerary is as follows:    17 May 24 - Arrive around 9 am and take the Tube from LHR to South Kensington (hotel location).  I shall buy the 1-day Anytime ticket at GBP 14.90 from Zone 6 to Zone 1.  I will purchase this ticket at Heathrow.    From 18 to 24 May 24 - I shall buy the 7-day Travel Card for Zone 1 & 2 at GBP 40.70.  I only intend to visit the places/attractions within Zone 1 & 2.  I will purchase this 7-day Travel Card at Heathrow.    25 May 24 - Travel from South Kensington to LHR around 5 pm.  I shall buy the 1-day Anytime ticket at GBP 14.90 from Zone 1 to Zone 6.  I will purchase this ticket at South Kensington.    Therefore my total ticket fare is GBP 70.50.    Are my calculations correct?  Have I understood the ticket/fare requirements correctly?    Many thanks for your input. ,Edmund P,London,"Singapore, Singapore"
Trying to pick a Heathrow hotel for our return flight we'll need to arrive at the terminal at 5am. I don't want to take a bus at that hour just whatever is easiest. The Hilton in T2 seems like the obvious choice but we need two rooms and it is $$$.    Looking at the Hyatt Place Radisson Blue or really any others....is it easy enough to prebook a car service or taxi or uber that early in the morning? The ease of the Hilton in T2 is tempting but trying to determine if other hotels have readily available early morning transport available.    Thank you! ,DawnB263,England,"Chicago, Illinois"
Normally my Husband and I travel independently throughout the world 8 months of the year. Scotland was going to be our May 2024 trip. But I have not completed the itinerary because it was a difficult year for us. My husband was diagnosed with a very aggressive brain tumor. We did manage to return to Kenya for February between his treatments. He took his last forever journey without me in September. I have asked a family member to travel with me. We will fly into London and take a train up to Edinburgh. She has never done any traveling so I will show her London for several days. Edinburgh is scheduled for 3 nights. Should we drive East or West? We had planned to drive the North Coast 500 but now I am thinking the 2 of us do not need to go that far North. Unless the scenery and small towns are worth the drive? We do have the time. Edinburgh towards the Isle of Skye. This is my dilemma. I understand there is a North and a South route from Edinburgh. Is it possible to see and experience all that the area has to offer without doubling back? I will be renting a car in Edinburgh. ,,Scotland,
Planning to visit London in March with boys 15 and 7  We have about 10 days holidays Friday to the Sunday after.    How many days would be good for a first time visit? Plan to only do London and places nearby. Is Edinburgh worth it in March?    Also pls suggest a good place to stay and some must sees.    Kids are foodies love bustling markets. They are not much into Museums but will be interested in castles/churches/palace    7yo is a Harry Potter fan so one day is taken care off.    15 year old loves soccer and cricket. ,Mimi2420,London,"New York City, New..."
We have a week in Scotland in late Dec. Booked so far: few days in Edinburgh night in St Andrews night up in Braemer one night yet to plan and then back to Edinburgh.    The night in question we were originally planning to go to Glencoe. But after asking on this forum about best routes I'm slightly scared off by reports of possible road closures. Any recs for this one night? Is it crazy to go all the way over to Glencoe from Braemer then back down to Edinburgh? Should we head east instead of west -- and hit Banchory or a coastal town on the way back to Edinburgh in lieu of Glencoe? Ideally looking for cute little towns scenery and a castle or two ;) ,kate b,Scotland,
Hi I’ve searched all over and can’t seem to find a definitive answer to this question. I will be traveling with my wife and three kids 1618 20. We will all have our own iPhones and I would like to have the same no foreign transaction fee card set on each phone to use as contactless payment via Apple Pay for our tube and bus rides.

From the people who brought you RailAir 1 to Reading and RailAir 2 to Woking/Guildford comes the new RailAir3 coach service from Heathrow to Watford.    It's running hourly between Terminals 2/3 and Watford Junction Station from 0430 to 2145 with one-way fares from £9. Journey time is around 50 minutes which is a 10-minute improvement on the existing 724 Green Line service. However the 724 benefits from £2 fare capping.

Hi.I'm looking for some advice on the best way to do this not necessarily the cheapest but I do always like a bargain! Travelling with wife and two kids of 7 and 5. Will have two large-ish suitcases one smaller one and a few bits of hand luggage.    We land in Gatwick (South)  at 16.00 on a Monday (in April 2024) and are then flying from Heathrow T5 to Newcastle the following day at 11.00.    I figure the best plan is to get ourselves somewhere near Heathrow stay in a hotel and then have a fairly easy morning trip to T5.    Some of the Premier Inns around Heathrow look good value. T4 is £37.50 for a family room for the night. Staines is £49 (and quite appeals because there are plenty of nearby places to eat). Seems no advantage of staying at Premier Inn T5 (£65) since it will need transport in the morning anyway.    I have done a bit of digging and come up with four options for the transfer:    National Express - £52 for the four of us to T4 but they don't seem all that regular (especially direct ones). Also what happens if our flight to Gatwick is delayed? Does the ticket get us on the next available one or do we need to buy the Fully Flexible (£113) for that?    Train - Only £42 for Anytime Day Singles to Staines for all four of us. So no worries if flight is delayed. But concerned about having to change in Clapham faffing around with luggage and kids etc especially as it will likely be evening rush hour.    Pre-booked Car Transfer - Probably the simplest but I am getting quotes of around £120 to £140. Does that sound about right?    Just book an Uber when we land at Gatwick - What is this likely to cost and would we have much of a wait for it?    What would anybody recommend (bearing in mind kids/luggag etc)? Any advice much appreciated. ,mrvin,London,"Gateshead, United..."
I was planning on meeting up with a friend tomorrow night at Dragonfly am wondering if it would be advisable to make a booking beforehand to ensure me and my friend can get in on the night since it's getting rather close to Christmas so things will probably be busier. ,Sean,Edinburgh,
Heading to Windsor Castle on a Saturday in October using the London Pass. (In hindsight probably shouldn’t have got a London Pass but it’s too late for a refund now). Keen to hear from anyone else who has done this. Using the pass means we can’t get entry until 1pm. Thought we’d arrive in Windsor at 10ish explore the township in the morning see the guard marching past the Guildhall just prior to 11am have lunch at a pub. Super keen to see St George’s chapel (and the Queen’s resting place) but they recommend you be there by 2.30pm. Absolutely don’t want to miss this.  Questions:  1. Is it possible to see the chapel first and then see the rest of the castle?  2. What time should we arrive at the castle for 1pm entry?  3. Any other suggestions for the day?  Thanks for your help. ,Tanimun,Windsor,"Brisbane, Australia"
I am planning a trip to visit IoM for the TT race for my husbands 40th birthday. This has been a multi decade dream and I want to surprise him with an unforgettable trip. We will be traveling from the US and are flexible with dates and travel itinerary. I am planning to make this a 2-3 week vacation with visits to other European destinations ( UK Ireland Scotland France) with that said I would like to know how long should I plan to spend at the races? Which week is the best? I was thinking the end of qualifying week (Th/Fri) and Sat/M and possibly Wed for race week. I wish we could do the entire two weeks but we really want to travel to other areas and won't have the time.  I am very detail oriented and have planned MANY trips but this one makes me nervous due to all the deadlines of ordering tickets and booking far enough in advance. Am I better off hiring an agency or just jumping on to schedule things as they are released?    Any other tips would be greatly appreciated  Thank you ,sheryl l,Isle of Man,
My husband and I will be staying in Fort William for two nights having just completed a self guided walking tour of the West Higland...since we will have one full day in Fort William I'm writing to see if we could take a train from Fort William to Mallaig have lunch there and return to Fort William for the night?

Hi all I’m planning a trip to London with a teen and a tween so I’m definitely looking for a little more space than a standard hotel room. I found a gorgeous place for a reasonable price on Ivy Lettings but this particular place is new and has no reviews yet.

We are touring Scotland next year and plan to drive. We initially want to take public transport up to the Highlands and rent a car once in Oban or Fort William. Not crazy enough to drive up from Edinburg or Glasgow as seniors from Canada.  I so far have had no luck finding a car rental agency. Is it possible to rent cars there? Can anyone pass on some info please?  Or do we have to go to Inverness? ,maureen s,Scotland,
I parked in the T2 West multi-storey car park last week but because I went along the road at the front of T2 I was charged a £5 drop-off fee. Some recent toll charge barriers have been installed since my previous stays at T2 earlier in the year where you could drive past T2 on your way to the T2 West car park.  But my official car park booking directions are confusing. They tell me that I *can* go past the front of T2.  --------  From the M56  ...  Exit the M56 at Junction 5 and keep left following the signs for Terminal 2.  At the first roundabout take the 3rd exit following signs to Terminal 2.  At the second roundabout take the second exit into Palma Avenue signposted for T2 Multi Storey East. Stay in the right-hand lane and ***follow the road past the terminal building*** and T2 Multi Storey East. Continue following the road straight at the tear-drop then at the first roundabout take the first exit signposted T2 West. Stay in the left lane and the entrance is on your left.  -------------  Anyone with local knowledge know the best route? ,mikem004,Greater Manchester,"London, United..."

I decided to skip our Thanksgiving holiday and went to London. This was supposed to be a six night trip but when my flights had to be changed due to a schedule change I extended the trip to seven nights. It was my eighth time in London. I ended up staying at three hotels. This is not ideal but I made it work. The first hotel was the Easy Hotel in Paddington. I stayed there the first night as my second hotel did not have a room available that night. The Easy Hotel room was clean and small. The shower was the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. The public areas are a little scruffy. The second hotel was the Jesmond Hotel in Bloomsbury/Fitzrovia across from the University of London. I had a small en-suite single. It was clean and comfortable and came with a full English breakfast. The last hotel was the Tudor Court Hotel in Paddington. I had a small double which was fine for one person but would have been tight with two people and luggage. I used the tube the Elizabeth line trains and the Heathrow Express for all of my travels. I used City Mapper to plan most of my travels for the first time. I love the feature that shows when the next tube train is and it lists at least three more after it. When walking it did give me some dodgy directions such as it sent me to the back of the Sir John Soan Museum and it wanted me to cut through the Bedford Square park which is impossible as it is locked and not for public use.    Day 1    I liked the daytime flight to LHR. The line was very short for immigration when we landed after 8:30 pm. The Heathrow Express is great if staying in Paddington and you get an early discount.    Day 2    I moved hotels. I found some breakfast then some shopping at Boots and Primark. I had a great paid tour at the Sir John Soane museum where you get to see the redone private apartments. Next I went to the Temple Church. It was then back to the hotel for a rest. I had an early dinner at a local cafe then the British Museum which was open late. 20000 steps    Day 3    Shopping then a pantomime matinee performance of Cinderella at the Lyric in Hammersmith. The interior of the theater is beautiful. After the show it was off to Briget’s bakery near Covent Garden for a great afternoon tea. The Covent Garden area was nuts. I had an evening ticket for the ballet The Dante Project at the Royal Opera House. The upper slips bench seats are terribly uncomfortable. I won't sit there again. 11000 steps    Day 4    Off to Birmingham for some Xmas spirit. I had an early lunch at the Xmas market. Then I saw the Birmingham Royal Ballet's version of the Nutcracker. I enjoyed it very much. The music is so great. My plan was to go back to the Christmas market and come home on an 8 pm train. It was drizzling and colder so I purchased a return ticket at 1630 and was back in London before 7 pm. 12500 steps    Day 5    I had a 1030 ticket for the Chanel exhibit at the V & A. There was not a line but they would not let me go in early. The clothing was beautiful. I loved the pre-WW II clothes. It was amazing how many of the dresses etc could be worn today as is. I had my mandatory scone and tea then visited the jewelry exhibit which I always love. I decided to go to the portrait gallery since I had not been since the refurb. Tonight I saw Guys and Dolls at the Bridge Theatre. It was great and I really enjoyed the performance. I sort of wish I had done the interactive floor seats but I did not want to stand for almost 3 hrs. I was in the higher cheaper seats in the back but could see almost everything. 17200 steps.    Day 6    Morning walk with London Walks. This walk pertained to the development of the tube. Learned some things I did not know. Ended up in the Covent Garden area for lunch. I decided to go to the Pick n Cheese restaurant again like my last trip. It is the cheese conveyor belt restaurant. It was not the day for all the plates you could eat. Then back to my hotel for a rest. I had 6 pm tickets for Christmas at Kew. I really enjoyed the lights and sounds. The weather was chilly but clear. 19000 steps    Day 7    I moved hotels first thing then off to the Guild Hall Gallery to see the gold and silver thread exhibit. It was actually quite interesting especially the altar cloth made out of an embroidered dress of Queen Elizabeth I. I had lunch at the Real Greek near Covent Garden. Back to my hotel for a rest. Once it got dark I went to Oxford Circus and walked to see the Christmas lights all the way to Trafalgar Square. Carnaby Street was my favorite. I had dinner at the Paramount Lebanese Kitchen near my hotel. 16800 steps    Day 8    A train broke down on the Elizabeth Line at Paddington right before I entered the station to go to LHR to fly home. They could not say when the line would be up and running. I had to pivot. I looked for an Uber but none were available. So the Heathrow Express was my best option as I was already about 20 minutes behind schedule. I made the next train and got to the airport about 25 minutes later than I had planned. A very uneventful flight and Uber ride home.    Thanks to everyone who answered the questions I asked. I did not end up taking some of the suggestions but they were appreciated and maybe they will help someone else. ,lam91897,London,"Washington, DC"

BE WARNED>>>> have just received a £120 fine (reduced to £60) for non payment of driving in the Bradford area clean air zone. I drive a T5 campervan and had absolutely no idea that Bradford had a clean air zone or saw any sign advertising the fact. I visited Haworth in my van for the first time on 28/4 and today (15/5) received a fine in the post for non payment of fine. The £9 a day charge is steep enough without having to pay £60 when there was no obvious signage to inform me to pay. First and last trip to the area from Lincolnshire. If you appeal the fine then you risk having to pay £180 if you lose the appeal. I understand now that I had to pay £9 but feel there should be at least some warning and a one off chance of explaining that I had no idea there was a clean air zone!

Morning all    We're coming to Edinburgh next weekend (1st December) for an event/performance. We've been to the city plenty of times and to save money on accommodation we're staying at Dunfermline Travelodge and travelling in and out by train. We'll also have time to have a better look at Dunfermline which we visited briefly last year.    Are there typically taxis at Dunfermline Queen Margaret that we can just jump in when we get off the train (probably after 10 p.m.)? Google Maps tells us that we can get a bus part of the way and of course we can walk although that might not be fun if it's raining. ,pandachris2,Dunfermline,Shrewsbury

Hi All!    Americans venturing outside of London for the first time and would love to help with travel accommodations.    Our family will be spending Christmas in the Cotswolds from Dec 23 to Dec 26. My partner and I will then be going to Bristol on the 26th. Since this is Boxing Day we're leaning towards renting a car from Oxford but are unsure of how difficult the driving will be and if it's even worth having a rental car in Bristol. We also saw that there's a bus from Cheltenham that we can possibly have our parents drop us off at.    Any insight on this would be wonderful! ,yackandrach,Cotswolds,
I was checking hotel prices in Edinburgh for just a one night stay next June. I was dumbfounded by the extremely high rates and lack of availability the second weekend in in that month. Is there something extra special taking place in Edinburgh that week or weekend that is the reason for the exorbitant accommodation prices? I didn’t expect accommodations to be low-cost but certainly not this pricey! We have stayed in cities such as Rome New York London Paris etc. and I’ve never seen prices this high overall.    We have not been to Edinburgh in 15 years. Of course I understand that is a long time ago. Plus rates everywhere have risen quite a bit. Especially since people  resumed traveling after covid driving prices up. The prices I have seen so far may prohibit us from spending even one night in Edinburgh. I guess it is all about supply and demand. I thought August would be the toughest time to find accommodations.    We were thinking of taking a 1 to 3 day tour up to the highlands area or even driving ourselves. If we take the tour we will have to likely stay somewhere central in the city to meet up with the tour group early one morning. However at these rates it looks like this plan is going to fall through. ,mlbcruiser,Edinburgh,"St. Louis, MO"

Hi we are a retired couple from Australia and this is the final leg of a six week trip to the UK. We will be spending 4 nights in Cornwall either ending around Port Isaac or Mousehole. We are deciding whether to ditch the car in Exeter where we hired it from and get a train to Brighton or drive with a one or two night stopover. Could anyone suggest a scenic route to take with an overnight stop. We are considering Shaftesbury Isle of Wight or Weymouth.  I have also read in posts that are several years old that it is an extremely busy trip traffic wise. Is this still the case?  Lastly could anyone suggest villages that are slightly less expensive than Mousehole and Port Isaac? Thanks in advance Jill ,Jill M,Cornwall,
I'm considering a trip that would have me arriving at LHR at 2240 (on a Thurs in March) and connecting to a flight from LGW at 1420 the next day. (AA to BA but separate tickets.) So my current thought is to transfer at night on arrival and stay at an airport hotel at Gatwick (probably the Hilton by the south terminal) that night.    I've been looking at transport options and there's a National Express coach from T3 (I assume the central bus station) at 2240 and 0040. So if flight is very early (sometimes it's almost an hour early) I might conceivably make the 2240 but if it's on time there's a long wait for the next coach. So I was thinking of the train.    I believe I can use either an Oyster (which I have already) or a contactless card (which I also have) to pay for the tube/Elizabeth line + train. It seems like there are 3 routes:  Tube to Victoria for train to Gatwick  Elizabeth line to Farringdon for train to Gatwick  Tube to St Pancras for train to Gatwick    As far as I can tell all of these routes would take about 2 hrs and cost about 15 GBP for the tube routes and 22 GBP for the Elizabeth line route. Is there any advantage to any of them (other than the Elizabeth line cars are nicer)?    So it seems like if I have less than an hour to wait for the coach I should take the coach otherwise I should take the train. Currently the coach is 20 GBP plus 5 GBP to make it changeable. If I buy for today it's 29 GBP so I assume that would be the cost if I buy on arrival. So I might as well buy on arrival.    The only problem with this flight into LHR is that if it's delayed significantly it runs into the curfew at LHR and gets delayed by about 8 hours. If that happened I'd be traveling at rush hour the next morning. The Nat'l Express website gives 1.5 hrs for the trip at 7:30 AM but I don't know how often it's delayed. Google says in the morning the delays are likely to be in the other direction but would the train be more reliable in the morning? Also the train prices for anytime tickets on the Nat'l Rail website from St Pancras are 13.70 GBP but the TFL fare finder says 17.50 GBP with contactless. (Victoria says 19.50 for anytime.) So is it actually cheaper to buy a ticket than to use contactless?    Thanks for any advice. ,btgm,London,Illinois

My daughter and I are staying near the British Museum and are traveling with luggage. Could anyone shed light on the strike and possible alternatives? Bus or ride-share perhaps? If we use the Tube is there a transfer involved? Thank you so much for any help. ,medusa1212,London,new york

Hi. I will be arriving at Gatwick Airport on Sunday December 10 to visit a friend at Queenstown Road Greater London SW8 3RT U. K. I would like to know if there is an underground train that goes to that address. What other modes of transportation are available.    I am arriving at Gatwick Airport around 8:00 a.m. and will be visiting my friend in the afternoon so I will have plenty time no rush.    Please advise    Thank you. ,Leroy,London,
We are visiting Ireland/Scotland late April-early May. It looks like we will be in Scotland approx May 1-9 ish doing self drive in each country. We will be approx 9-10 nights in Scotland but no reservations are made as of now so we are flexible. We are 4 adults late 60’s. We are not hikers or bikers (gentle walks are OK). We aren't big history buffs so no need to make the trip heavy on history. We enjoy cute towns (not heavy on shopping) local foods and pubs. The wow factor for scenery is priority. I have already been schooled from you about the 50 shades of green and not so much for early May.    We will fly into Edinburgh from Shannon on a 12:30 departure (not booked yet). Maybe see Edinburgh Castle that same day mid afternoon. Day 2 -I imagine we will walk around Edinburgh. Day 3 we will pick up our car and drive to Hadrian’s Wall (Walltown Crags). I know this is a huge day as we will then head towards the Glasgow area on our return from HW. I had always pictured us leaving from Edinburgh seeing the Kelpies Stirling and on to Oban Glen Coe Isle of Mull or Isle of Skye etc. but my friend has this site on her bucket list.    I had tried to reserve 2 nights on Isle of Mull but nothing available for our days and price range (E160 ish). I guess it will need to be Isle of Skye (not a hardship) as there would be more lodging to choose from. I was just trying not to be like “everybody” and go to Skye.    Some out of the ordinary experiences would be great to add. I might look into a falconry experience if it doesn't happen in Ireland. Is there any hands on cheese making? I do happen to think there are a few distilleries where you can blend your own whiskey!    I need some starter ideas as to how many nights in places (Day 4-9). It was suggested on this forum that Oban can be fairly central to some day trips.    Day 1-arrive Edinburgh see sites (Castle)  Day 2-enjoy Edinburgh  Day 3-Pick up car and drive to Hadrian’s Wall. Leave the area towards Glasgow-overnite where???  Day 4-9- Oban Glen Coe Mull or Skye Loch Lomond/Trossachs (boat ride on the Loch?)Stirling the Kelpies Cairngorms (southern area of park?)  Day 10-fly out from Edinburgh    I know we can’t do it all so I am wondering how to pare this down to something manageable. We don’t mind doing a couple of one-nighters if needed.    Thank you in advance. I know this was a bit long...I appreciate your help. ,Sparks,Scotland,"Summerville, South..."

We will be in London December 22-30. I'd love some feedback on our plans. We are trying not to be too over-scheduled. Staying in an apartment in Pimlico through Ivy Lettings. Two adults and two teens.  Arrive 7:30 Dec. 22. Heathrow Express to Paddington. Tube to King's Cross. Store luggage outside King's Cross. Harry Potter store and explore King's Cross. British Museum tickets at 12:30. Back to King's Cross; take Victoria line to Pimlico Station. Check into apartment. Get groceries and get to bed early.  Dec. 23 - Food Tour at London Bridge at 10:30. Explore that area including Christmas Market. Back to apartment then Phantom of the Opera and His Majesty's theater that evening.  Dec. 24 - Nothing planned during the day. Wondering about Harrod's or if too crowded. Open top bus light tour of major London sites at 6:15.  Christmas Day - nothing booked. May book a Christmas dinner or do walk in somewhere or may order Christmas meal from Sainsbury's or similar and heat up in apartment. May walk to a church for services.  Dec. 26 - Thinking maybe Covent Garden area. Shops and restaurants. It looks like Westminster Abbey is actually open for tours that day so maybe that and then walk to Covent Garden (lots of sites on the walk including Trafalgar Square Downing Street National Gallery etc.).  December 27 - Two of us have tickets to Chelsea game with tour/meal ahead of time. Other two will hit Tate Modern and/or Tate Britain and then Back to the Future musical that night. Debating doing Churchill's war rooms that morning or waiting on that and having a quiet morning.  Dec. 28 - day trip to Windsor  Dec. 29 - If we don't do it on Dec. 27 Churchill's War Rooms. Maybe Westminster Abbey.  Dec 30 - depart.  Thanks for any feedback. ,paula r,London,

Hi. We are coming to Scotland at the end of the month. Our current itinerary is Edinburgh to St. Andrews to Braemer to Glencoe and back to Edinburgh (9 days total). Looking for specific suggestions for some of our drives as it looks like there are multiple routes and am wondering which are most scenic (obviously weather permitting).    Hoping for suggestions for the following routes:  - St. Andrews to Braemer possibly stopping for a walk at Balmoral.  - Braemer to Glencoe  - Glencoe to Edinburgh    Also any recommendations for sights along the way are greatly appreciated! Thanks! ,kate b,Scotland,
Good day everyone!    I'll be traveling to London Stansted Airport on October 29th and I'll be departing from Baker Street at 4 am since my flight is scheduled for gate close at 7:30 am. There will be three of us and we'll have two pieces of luggage with us.    I'm currently exploring the option of arranging a private airport transfer.    I've come across Umbrella Transfers - London Airport Transfers Taxi and Airport Taxi Transfer (ATT) and I've noticed that their Google and TripAdvisor reviews are quite goooddd. However I wanted to seek some additional feedback to ensure their reliability and to confirm if there are any hidden charges associated with their services. The estimated cost for this transfer falls in the range of 96 to 113 p ound    Do any of you have experience with these services or could you recommend another reliable airport private transfer option?    Thank you!! ,eranthechoo,London,Kuala Lumpur...
First time planning a trip from the U.S. to Scotland so I would appreciate any feedback from the pros on here on the tentative plan I have pulled together. My wife and I both work in the museum art and history fields and we both like good food gardening and authentic experiences. We prefer spending time outdoors on vacation and enjoy rural communities a little more than large metropolitan cities. I don’t want to plan too much so I can leave some room for discovering a few things on our own. Thanks for any suggestions or weak points you spot in the route/plan.    Day 1  Arrive at Edinburgh Airport early morning and use Airlink (service 100) express bus to City Centre and walk to Rabble Edinburgh Hotel and Restaurant. Store luggage until check-in. Eat lunch and explore. Check into hotel rest have dinner and early bedtime.    Day 2 and 3 (and some of day 1)  Explore Edinburgh: On the list currently for consideration is Edinburgh Castle the National Gallery the National Museum of Scotland Arthur’s Seat Canongate Kirk Graveyard Dynamic Earth George IV Bridge Gladstone’s land the Museum of Edinburgh the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Writer’s Museum. Of course we won’t get to all of it but we’ll do what we can squeeze in. The extra daylight will certainly help.    Day 4  Take bus back to Edinburgh Airport and rent car. Drive 25 miles to Culross Palace. Explore then drive 44 miles to Murrayshall Country Estate in Perth to check in. Visit Branklyn Garden and explore the area.    Day 5 and 6  Possibly visit Scone Palace the Perth Art Museum Drummand Castle Gardens Stirling Castle the Kelpies and the Black Witch Castle and Museum.    Day 7  Check out early enough to drive 100 miles and get to Fort William and the Jacobite Train Station in time to board by 10:15. Lunch and explore Mallaig then return via train back to Fort William by 16:00. Drive 141 miles to The Edinbane Lodge on the Isle of Skye. Make reservations to have a late dinner at the Taste of Skye restaurant.    Day 8  Check out of hotel and explore Isle of Skye and hike to the Fairy Pools. Drive 85 miles to The Whispering Pine Lodge in Loch Lochy Spean Bridge.    Day 9 and 10  Explore the area. Possibly do some hiking check out the castles and gardens in the area but also unwind and chill a little at the lodge.    Day 11  Check out of the lodge and head 124 miles to Glasgow exploring along the way. Check into the Apex City of Glascow Hotel. Plan for a quick visit to the Kelingrove Art Gallery.    Day 12  Drive 78 miles to Abbotsford House in Melrose. Return to Glascow in time to see whatever museums or monuments we can squeeze in that evening.    Day 13  Drive to Edinburgh Airport early to return car and depart at 12:30 for return flight home.    Thanks for any suggestions or insight. ,Scott W,Scotland,

Flight to London Heathrow rent a car drive to Newquay.    3 nights staying in Newquay.  3 nights staying in Falmouth.  1 night staying in Cardiff.      D1: Arrived at noon in LHR took a shuttle bus with luggage to car depot 7 minutes.  Obtained the rental car quickly (less than 30 minutes). The roads out of the airport are massive and troublesome. Intended to drive via M4 M5 and A30 but the navigator leaded us to M3 A303 and A30. From the Google map it takes 4.5h but we have spent 2h more to reach the hotel in the late evening. A lot of traffic jams on roads mostly before Exeter. Not sure through M4 and M5 would be better.    D2: Drove to Tintagel Castle. Due to rain and wind the bridge to the castle was closed. Walked around the hill for an hour and had a coffee in the village. Then drove to Port Isaac. Rain stopped but still very windy. Huge waves stroke both Port Isaac and Port Gaverne cliffs. Very impressive. Had a simple lunch in Port Isaac. Further drove to Padstow visited the National Lobster Hatchery very interesting. Sun came out and wind eased. Walked around the lovely harbour area. Had a lobster dinner at Rick Stein’s Seafood Bar. Good but not very impressed.    D3: Walked 2.5h along the coast around Newquay: Tolcarne beach Towan beach Headland Fistral beach River Gannel. Fistral beach is very impressive has long sandy beach. A lot of people exercise their surfing ability. Many children were lying on a short board towards waves. Most of them wear wet suits. Had lunch at Rick Stein’s Fish&Chipps very tasty. Then drove to National Trust Carnewas at Bedruthan. Walked along the cliff coast. Marvellous views and beautiful sandy beaches. At Bedruthan Steps the path to the beach was closed but saw few people managed to reach the beach very wide and nice golden sandy beach.    D4: Drove to St Ives. Parked the car at St Erth and took the train to St Ives. Cute harbour with many tourists. Walked around the harbour and via St Ives Head to Porthmeor beach long sandy beach with many people on surfing there. Also had a short visit to the Tate St Ives. On the train back to St Erth saw Carbis Bay beach even longer but quiet without high waves. Back to the car and drove to Falmouth. Had dinner in Restaurant Chain Locker at the harbour very satisfied.    D5: From Falmouth drove to Land’s End. It’s foggy on the way there. At the site the fog slowly disappered. Walked 1h around the coast nice trail. Then drove to The Minack Theatre. Without pre-booking no entry. Currently there are shows in the afternoons and evenings. Only morning 5 time slots are for visiting the theatre but they are all long booked out. Visited the Porthcurno beach beside small but fine sandy beach from there even walked up to the theatre and back to car park. Further drove to Penzance which has a long water front promenade. Quite comfortable for a stroll. Had a lunch there and walked the high street two blocks away from the water front. On the way back to Falmouth stopped at Marazion and luckly could walk to the Michael’s Mount on the causeway as it was a low tide time. It was too late to enter the castle site. It’s pity.    D6: Drove to The Lizard Point. A very lovely site for beautiful views and nice walk. Had Cornish pasties for lunch at Ann’s Pasties & Bar one of the best pasty bakeries. In the afternoon had 1.5h walk around the town coast in Falmouth till Pendennis Castle. In Restaurant Kona had dinner where we had the best tender local lobster. Kona is located at the harbour is a casual dinning place but the food is very tasty.    D7: Drove to Cardiff over 4h without much delay. Had a short stroll in the city centre with the Cardiff Castle on the road side. Also visited the harbour with the Millennium Center. The parliament building was open for visitors a nice building facing the sea and has a stylish wooden interior design.    D8: Took M4 heading London Heathrow. Took 2.5h with some traffics. It took some turns to reach the car depot. Returning the car was easy 10 minutes no issues at all. Then rode the shuttle bus to the terminal.    Summarised in short: A satisfied trip with a lot of walks on the Southwest Coast Path. Beautiful cliff coast views nice sandy beaches very kind people encountered all kind of weather experience temperature was comfortable between 14 and 20 degrees but water temperature is only 16 degrees too cold for me to swim in the sea. It was not very crowded though many children at beaches and dog walkers on trails. We recommend Cornwall for people loving walks coast views nice food (specially seafood) and drinks.

Moneycorp ATM fee at Gatwick is a scam  My partner took 200 euros from the Moneycorp ATM at Gatwick airport on 2 August 2023 and was charged £215.36. The mid market rate for 200 euros was £171. So Moneycorp have charged £44 on a 200 euro withdrawal. This is outrageous dishonesty.    My partner is dyslexic and found the screen cluttered and confusing. It is as if Moneycorp are deliberately scamming those who do cannot read English well. Some fee is reasonable but this is just robbery.

My sister and brother in law live abroad but love coming to London for the history. They are next over in April 2024 and I plan to send them a gift voucher for Xmas for a London tour (c£250)    My sister has dropped hints that she would love to go to the Old Bailey to watch a trial with a tour around the legal Inns followed with a meal in a quirky historic London pub.

Hi    We are a family of four (kids will be 10 and 7) visiting London next July. They have never been before so we want to see the major sites. Our kids are good travelers but we know that we have an upper limit (3-4 hours) at any one site. We will have 6 full days including the day we arrive very early from the USA (our flight leaves at 12:30pm local and arrives at LHR at 7:00am local so idk if we'll be getting any sleep or we may be a total mess that day).    We want to visit mostly sites in central London and also Hampton Court Palace and Windsor castle--not sure if it is more efficient to go and visit these as two separate train trips or to do a single day bus tour of both.    Here is my initial plan. I haven't been to London in many years so not sure if these things go together geographically practically etc. And also obviously avoiding churches on Sunday but not sure if other places would be more/less crowded on a weekend vs. a weekday.    Weds: arrive 7:00am at LHR transit to hotel leave bags. HOHO bus tour (stay on for a full loop) National Gallery/National Portrait Gallery  Thurs: Tower of London Tower Bridge Leadenhall Market (?) St. Paul's Covent Garden  Fri: day bus or train tour to Hampton Court and/or Windsor  Sat: British Museum Southwark Cathedral Borough Market(?)  Sun: ??  Mon: check out and leave bags at hotel Westminster Abbey Big Ben V&A (?). Travel out to LHR for 1 night at airport hotel before 7am flight the next day    I also want to fit in time for experiences like afternoon or high tea perhaps a show one night and shopping or food halls.    Thanks for any advice! ,Wanderer297396,London,
Hello all    British airways has kindly changed our flight time from a 8:55 departure to a 7:10 departure. We are staying at the Holiday inn White chapel. It appears our only option other than Taxi or Uber is 2 buses leaving at 2:30 to arrive about 5am.    Don’t really want to do that..So I am  considering staying in Slough the night before for easy transport to Windsor and to the airport the next morning. I chose Slough because I don’t want to waste a whole day by the airport. And I also don’t want to check out of our London hotel have them store our bags and have to come back and get them. And then go to an airport hotel.    We haven’t been to Windsor so I thought we would check out take the Elizabeth Line to Slough dump our bags at the hotel across the street ( another holiday inn) and go to Windsor for the afternoon .    The flight line bus is very near the hotel as well and gets us to Heathrow Term5 about 4:47 the next day if all goes well. We will likely not be checking any luggage.    Is this a good plan? If not what would you do differently?  Thank you in advance for your thoughts ,Denise M,London,Gig Harbor...

Hi people can I take 2 rolling suitacses on a london bus from Kings Cross/St pancras to high street Kensington which I believe is the number 27 bus? And would it be better to travel at off peak times? And could anybody please tell me the best times to travel this service?    TIA    Graham ,Graham S,London,
I was recently contacted by a fraudster pretending to represent a hotel I had booked via Booking.com. They asked me to click a confirm link via email which was an odd request.    Also all the information they had about me was correct including my reservation details.    In addition to the WhatsApp message I checked my Bookings account to find the same message there as though it came from the hotel - which made the request seem legitimate.      I've blocked my bank account and had to update all my security details because at this stage it's clear my account has been compromised. Has anyone else experienced this? If not please be weary! ,Lisa1,London,"London, United..."
Appalling - Never again.    Appalling! Booked and paid for online rang when we were 30 minutes away as per instructions - no answer after calling a few times; there were no instructions regarding where the parking was so we assumed as parking at Manchester airport the car parks would sign all in one place but it wasn’t. This car park isn’t where you’d expect and is quite a detour.  You pay an extra £6 twice to and from the airport. Returning from my holiday I rang when I had to collect my baggage as per instructions - again rang the number on the email no answer; after calling a few times each time the call went into voicemail; I had to wait for more than an hour for the min van driver to come and pick us up to go collect my car. Utterly shambolic and lack of customer service I would not recommend booking airport parking with Ezybook Airport Parking aka Platinum Parking Manchester. ,Evis,Manchester,"JHB, South Africa"
Hello  Does anyone know of any Bronte/Haworth coach tours? There was a Shearings four day coach tour but for some reason this has been discontinued.

Not a question but a warning to be careful when parking down at Lamorna Cove even if just to watch the sea for a few minutes on a nice evening after 6pm as I did. There is an ANPR camera that records your number plate going into and out of the car park. Even when the booth is unmanned don't assume the car park is not in operation. I got caught with a £100 fine reduced to £60.50 if paid in 14 days. I shall never drive to Lamorna Cove again unless prepared to pay for even a 5 minute stop. ,MarkJBK,Lamorna,"Farnham, United..."

Hi everyone what is the cheapest way to get to Derby after landing in Stanstead airport and how best to get there. What I’m seeing online is so expensive ,sena,,
I need 1 night hotel stay the night before i fly for 2 weeks from Manchester can someone tell me the best way to do this please. I have done it before but the car stayed at the hotel for the whole 2 weeks i can't seem to find that option anymore.    Ideally i wanted to park up sleep and then get to the airport by foot/shuttle bus early in the morning but most sites i am looking at are saying i would have to park the night i arrive in manchester or move the car in the morning? Also do the hotels do ealry breakfasts as we will need to be at the airport for 6am. Thanks in advance ,AliG40,Manchester,
Hi do you reckon that a 19.30 coach departure is feasible for a 16.30 kickoff? I took a guess for this possibility:    45×2 (both halves) + 15 (half time break) + 15 (stoppage time) = 120 mins / 2 hours  16.30 + 2 = 18.30    So by 18.30 I have to be out from the stadium to catch a tram back to the coach station. Is this a good spare time? I do not mind if I have to leave early but my concern would be the tram. Would it be packed? Is it better to just walk? Please keep in mind that I am a woman wearing hijab (but I am generally confident in being alone).    Thanks so much in advance! ,Salwaa Z,Greater Manchester,

We are planning to spend on night in Oxford in July 2024. Two adults two kids 4 and 7. We would ideally like to stay walking distance to sights but also on a budget… any recommendations?! ,finc,Oxford,Australia
My travel partner (D) and I (2 female travelers 53 & 76) traveled to London from Los Angeles Nov 21st- 27th. We took an overnight flight on Virgin Atlantic and arrived at 12:30 pm on Wednesday 22nd. We made it off the plane picked up luggage and thru passport control in approx 30 mins. Grabbed an iced coffee and took the Picadilly line to South Kensington tube station and walked 1/2 mile to our Vbro in Chelsea.  The tube was easy to figure out and since it was the first stop it wasn’t busy. I set up my iPhone before leaving for Apple Pay. Quick adjustment in Settings allows you to use the phone for tapping in/out without having to unlock it. (D)used her contactless credit card.  The flat was lovely with 2 bedrooms and 2 baths. Perfect for 2 adult women. We enjoy having our own space at night. We grabbed a few grocery items at the end of the street and headed back to the tube station and over to Harrod’s then on to Leicester Square and the night Toot Bus Christmas light tour at 6 pm  It was fun and kept us up and moving. Back to the flat for our first night.  Thursday - we had pre booked tickets to the Churchill war rooms for 9:30. We figured out the buses and began using the bus to the tube. Again very easy. I used Google maps Citymapper and TfL apps. I found I liked TfL best for Navigating the bus and tube and then used google maps once we got off the tube for walking directions to the destination. Stopped at the red phone boxes for a photo opportunity with the Elizabeth tower in the background. There was a small line at 3 different phone boxes but everyone took it in stride and we took our photos and moved on.  We waited just a couple minutes before entering the museum as they let us go in small parties. We used the audio guide and enjoyed the museum a lot. They really had the timing down so that the group ahead of us was mostly thru the 1st audio station before we got there so it was never super crowded.  Afterwords we went on a wild goose chase for a restaurant that served Pasties. (D’s) #1 food item to find. I had found a couple places on the other side of the Westminster bridge and saved them on google maps but alas they were never found. We ended up back at the cafe at Westminster Abbey. It was a pleasant meal. We had pre booked tickets to the Abbey at 2 pm. No verger tour so we used the audio guide. I had added the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Gallery tickets when I purchased without much knowledge of what I was buying. We went to that exhibit first as it closed a little earlier than the rest. It was really interesting and I think I enjoyed it more than the downstairs. The audio guide was a little harder to navigate for me than at the war rooms but we had a nice look around and listened when we found the stations.  Back to the flat and off to dinner at Bluebird on Kings Rd in Chelsea just a couple blocks away. It was fabulous! Highly recommend. I had the roasted carrots and (D) the halibut.  Friday-bus/tube to Tower of London. I again pre booked tickets. These were not timed tickets but we arrived around 9:30-10 am. Took the advice and went straight to see the Crown Jewels. Not crowded at all maybe 8-10 people other than us. Plenty of time to explore. We went back to the entrance and joined a Beefeater tour. This was a highlight for us! More personal than an audio guide. We then explored a little on our own and walked over Tower Bridge to Mallow at Borough Market for lunch. Also highly recommend. I am a vegetarian and this is a plant based restaurant. We did not have reservations but luckily got a table. We walked around the market afterwards and bought a couple sweet treats. Then back to the flat for a short break before taking the tube to Christmas at Kew. Again pre booked tickets for 6 pm. This was a fun experience but not necessarily a standout it was quite chilly and we walked thru pretty quickly. Went for pizza at Rossopomodoro on Fulham Rd near the flat and it was excellent!  Saturday - was very cold and we were off to Windsor Castle. Bus/tube/train and line to get thru security. Plan was to get there to see changing of the guard. By the time we got thru security and down to the viewing area the band was already in and it was very crowded. Very difficult to get a great view and we were in the shade. Got very cold and just couldn’t hang around to see the whole thing. We were just too uncomfortable. Went back and got the audio guide and toured the chapel and state rooms. Grabbed a snack at the cafe as we were just too chilled to try and go into town and find a place to eat. When we got back off the train at Paddington Station I spied a Pasty shop!! Score! We grabbed 2 to go and went back to the flat to eat. (D) closed her eyes to rest and that was the end of the day.  Sunday- completely free day. We slept in a little and then walked up Kings Road to Sloane Square. Since it was early on a Sunday not much was open but we enjoyed the walk. We took the tube from there to Trafalger square and explored around the area a bit. I am a Harry Potter fan so went to Kings Cross train station to get a photo of platform 9 3/4. There was a huge line for a personal photo opportunity so I just took a photo of the sign and didn’t wait in the line. We then headed back to Chelsea for fish and chips at a pub. We went to The Kings Arms on Fulham Road. We enjoyed our pub experience and the fish and chips. Stopped back thru the flat and it was still just light outside so we decided to go back to Harrods one last time.  Monday- we took the bus to the tube station and as we got to the platform we heard an announcement that there was no service to Heathrow. We reversed course and ordered a cab on the Gett app. Made it back to the airport and safely back to LA.  We really enjoyed our trip. We had nice weather with mostly sunny skies . It was quite chilly a couple of days but being from Southern California we are weather wimps. It only drizzled late Sunday night and only rain we saw was while sitting on the plane at the gate. We were there for only a few days and we missed some things we thought we would try and see but were not disappointed. Hope to see London again in the future. ,Michelle W,London,"Torrance, California"
Hi forum readers - Thanks for the comments on my previous post. This is a revised version:    We'll have 7 nights to spend in Scotland late April/early May first trip ever to the UK. This will be after spending 7 nights driving and hiking in Ireland. We will have a rental car. We were hoping to be able to experience both Edinburgh and Skye. Looking for advice...    Trip parameters:  1. We would like to spend at least 2 nights in Edinburgh but could be ok with a third or forth.  2. We really want to visit the Skye/Highlands or something equivalent as far as scenery and hiking goes.  4. We are concerned that we are setting ourselves up for too many hours in the car.  5. Lodging and food quality is mildly important but less so than getting out of the car and experiencing Scotland.    Questions:  1. Is trying to squeeze in both Edinburgh and Skye too much for 7 nights?  2. If we need to skip Skye what are alternatives that offer great hiking and scenery but less driving?  3. Any thoughts for a workable itinerary?  Thanks!    Following up on the previous discussions re: renting a car in Dublin and driving into/out of Scotland: According to Enterprise we ARE allowed to drive from Ireland to Scotland and to use the ferry (of course!) but with a ~203 euro surcharge plus the additional costs for ferry fees and fuel: Vehicles can be driven in Northern Ireland and UK mainland. Travels to Europe mainland are not permitted. At all airport locations the charge is 202.60 EUR for travels to the UK mainland. Travels to Northern Ireland are free of charge. Customers must always inform the rental branch of their intention to travel to the UK mainland with the vehicle and require authorization. ,Kevin P.,Scotland,"Seattle, Washington"

Hello! I'm in the process of planning a trip to London in mid-March and I could use some suggestions on visiting the Tower of London. I know that the general advice is to visit the Tower first thing in the morning due to crowds; however I'm thinking of booking a food tour in Borough Market on the same day so I'm wondering if it might work to visit the Tower in the afternoon around 1 pm? It would be on a weekday. If I need to move some things around to make it work for us to visit in the morning I can do that but I would love to do both in the same day due to proximity of the two locations.    I will be traveling with my husband and our two kids (15 and 13). Any advice? Thank you! ,Amy L,London,"San Antonio, Texas"
Hi there!    I've always booked one or two different locations when visiting Scotland in the past (always in Aug) as I know it is a busy tourism time and have had a fear of missing out or spending a lot of time searching for somewhere to sleep as opposed to adventuring. My partner however would like to wing it and book accommodation on the day depending on where we end up on any given day.      There are certain days where we will have certain activities booked in that I can book those nights accommodation in advance but I'm wondering if it is wise to book ahead or if winging it would be fine? ,Nikki McNamara,Scotland,"Brisbane, Australia"

Next April my wife and I are scheduled to arrive at Terminal 5 on a BA flight from an EU country at 9:00 PM and our continuing flight to Chicago on American leaves from Terminal 3 at 8:15 AM. Rather than try to sleep somewhere in one of the terminals we are planning to book a room at the Sofitel at Terminal 5.  Can I assume we can have our luggage checked through to our final destination while we leave the airport and return the next morning?  What would be easiest for foreigners to find our way from the Sofitel to Terminal 3 at 5:00 or 6:00 AM?  Would we check-in at the American counter or is it likely we would have boarding passes to just go to Security?  Are their other problems we should anticipate?  Thank you for your suggestions. ,alinaz,London,"Mesa, Arizona"

I got amazing recommendation from a previous question here for a holiday in 2022 and had a lovely walking week in Aysgarth. Looking for a similar village in another part of dales to explore. Like quieter village/walking but with shop/pub and a good base for walking in all directions. Happy to hike over fells and long distances. We did huge walks from Aysgarth and loved it. Will be going in June 2024. Based on research weighing up Buckden/Kettlewell area Sedburgh/Cowgill area or Horton in Ribbledale. I think Horton/Sedburgh might be busier areas so was thinking Buckden but thought I would ask the locals. ,ldj226,Yorkshire Dales National Park,"Brisbane, Australia"

Normally when we travel we purchase a UK SIM from one of the main carriers - Vodaphone or O2 and pop our Aussie SIM back in a couple of times just to check in. However now that most secure sites require a OTP we will need to keep our normal SIM in and just turn off data so we’re now looking at using the eSIM but although I can see that we can get lots of data on an eSIM in the UK to allow us to use Apple Maps etc I can’t seem to find any info on whether we can make local calls We both have Apple SE2 so I know they have eSIM capability.

Hello  I am exploring tickets for DFW to VRN (Verona Italy). AA is offering a ticket that includes a transfer from LHR to LGW for the second leg of the flight. This will be on a Sunday morning. The arrival at LHR is at 6:20am and it's AA so it will be T3. The departure from LGW would be at 10:10am on BA.    This is a little less than 4 hours; it seems like cutting it awfully close to me but this is offered by AA as a journey all on one ticket. So at least if we missed the 10:10am flight they would put us on the next one (which isn't until 6:30am the next morning).    We will have five suitcases with us (three of them carryon size) as we are going to Italy for 10 weeks for a work assignment. If I book this I would book MCE or Premium Economy so we will be closer to the front of the plane and I would book a car service to get from LHR to LGW. What are the chances this would work on a Sunday morning? ,TexasAnglophile,London,"Dallas, Texas"

Hello!    We're coming in July for a performance of Starlight Express which I know is not in the West End. My daughter is obsessed with that show. We'll be going to West End performances Warner Bros Tour and some theater tours. Hopefully will get Ceremony of the Keys tickets. I really enjoyed Windsor on our last trip. In my research someone recommended posting airbnbs to make sure they are legit. Thinking of staying in the theatre district since my daughter is a theatre major in college. We may or may not try to add Paris if we can somehow get tickets to the Olympics. Don't want to base our hotel on the Eurostar train but rather our London portion of the trip.

Hi would people recommend the 3 day tram ticket option. I’ll be arriving at Edinburgh airport and staying in the city. One of the things I will be doing is visiting the Royal Yacht.    As this includes a return ticket to and from the Airport plus the fact I get 3 days use in around the city which would cover transport to the Royal Yacht I see this as good option?    If I understand correctly I’m arriving on a Monday and returning home on the Thursday  my 3 day use would be Mon Tues & Weds but the return to airport on Thursday would be covered?

Hi everyone ;    We are arriving at the Stansted airport on the 21st of Dec  what is the most affordable cheapest way to get to Derby and where can we buy tickets ,sena,,
OK I have buttoned down my itinerary with my hubs. I know there will be some folks here that wish I were taking the road less traveled and in some ways I wish I was too but it is so hard to visit a place and miss the must see stuff we have heard so much about that makes a place famous. We aren't big on cities and are keen to spend as much time in nature as possible (but need civilization for eating/shopping etc). Please let me know if you have any suggested activities in the areas we will be or if you see any big problems with this plan.    -Aug 27 Tues Depart US night 6PM  -Aug 28 Wed Arrive 11AM AM after overnight flight- check into hotel drop bags and wash up if possible. Welcome to Scotland. Do as much as we can to acclimate to time zone. See Edinburgh hollyrood house and aurthurs seat.

I will be in London from december 12 tot the 14th with my mum.  I want to treat her to a nice High Tea in a Christmas decorated setting however I only find outrageous prices like 80 pounds per person. I know...it's London but I feel 160 pounds for tea and sandwiches is just not worth it.    So I was wondering if anyone here can suggest some more affordable high tea options that are still festive and in a nice location. Or otherwise maybe a nice Christmas decorated pub or restaurant for a nice lunch or dinner.    It basically needs to feel Christmassy and have some nice food  Thank you for your ideas! ,americagirl22,London,"Rotterdam, The..."
We are hoping to hike the Great Glen Way in late Spring (Fort William to Inverness) and then travel to the Orkneys for five days or so just to explore. A few questions: should we rent a car in Inverness and take a car ferry to the islands or travel without vehicle and make our way with public transport?  Is Stromness a good first base for us or would Kirkwall be better? Others?  Recommendations of things to not miss in that period of time. We would like to explore some archeological sites but realize we could spend weeks doing that. And also if possible find a few good day hikes to enjoy the landscape and wildlife.  Thanks so much! ,Lou J,Orkney Islands,"Baltimore, Maryland"

First off thank you all who answered my previous questions and helped me plan our December trip. Also huge thanks to all those who contributed and/or organized all the useful information on this forum.  I am finalizing our December 2023 trip itinerary and have some last-minute questions  1. Did I understand this correctly? Contactless is more convenient and preferred. No advance preparation is necessary. I pay whenever I use the public transportations just as I use my card for any other purchases (except with the caps I won’t break my bank nor can I get a refund if I don’t like my purchase ha!)  2. Questions about 2 for 1 (we may not do this due to #b below)  a. It can save money.  b. The biggest disadvantage is that you can’t book tickets in advance?  c. I only need the Travelcard on the days I am going to the participating sites and the Travelcard works the same way as the Oyster Card i.e. it works on buses tubes etc.  3. Going to Greenwich:  a. First is it a good idea to visit Greenwich in December or should I go to somewhere else such as Hampton Court where there are more Christmas festivities?  b. If we do go to Greenwich we have to do this on our last day in London when we have a 20:00 Eurostar train to Paris. Considering the time to get to and from Greenwich I am afraid we have to leave Greenwich no later than 16:00 and since the sites (e.g. Observatory Cutty Sark etc.) won’t open until 10:00 I am thinking if it’s worth the trip. I thought about doing Greenwich on an earlier day but due to the dates of our stay in London (a few days when some sites are not open) that means we have to do our more-favorite sites such as Westminster Abbey on our last day and I don’t want to take a chance of not being able to visit those.  c. Transportation to Greenwich: If I am not mistaken two options work the best for us: One less than 10 min-walk to the London Eye Waterloo Pier then take the RIB to Greenwich; two walk to the Waterloo station and take the Jubilee line to Greenwich. Both take about an hour but neither gives me the option to get off at walk the foot tunnel?  Your advice will be greatly appreciated. ,Jane,London,

Hello everyone!  I will be traveling to London early December on a business trip. It will be the first time I travel solo ever and I have a bit of anxiety so I need to make sure I have all info I need before arriving. So I arrive at Heathrow Terminal 3 and I plan to reach my lodging in Central London via Tube. I am planning on using the Elizabeth Line is it easy to navigate from the Heathrow Terminal 3 arrivals to Elizabeth Line station (are there signs and so on)? And where can I get the Oyster Card?  I am sorry if the questions seem a bit silly! ,Stacey B,London,
I know the topic of the HP studio tour in Leavesdon is all over TA but my question is if it's worth paying for the transportation from London to avoid the hassle of trying to get there with public transportation.  Our gift to our twenty something daughters who will be in London for a week in March (one lives in Los Angeles and the other lives in Nice France) will be tix to the studio tour.  They will be staying in London near South Kensington and have never spent time in London using public transportation (well once when quite young but that doesn't count).  It doesn't seem too complicated to figure out how to get there but might make for a bit of a stressful day to have to figure all that out especially at the end of the day when it might be dark out when they leave.  So wondering if it's worth the extra splurge to get transportation included or if it's basically a waste of money. There are packages that include pick up and drop off but of course not cheap.  Thank you! ,Lachance16,London,"Rochester, New York"

I am looking for suggestions for an overnight day trip from London that starts with Stonehenge. We are a family of 5 (w/teens/pre-teen). We will have a car and will be leaving London 12/26 in the morning for Stonehenge reservations that afternoon. After that we'd like to basically relax in the English countryside for the next 24 hours before returning to London for a show at 730p. (relax: stroll around and enjoy the sites of a cute town relax at hotel eat etc). Not enough of us are interested in Bath (sadly) plus it'd be nice to not have quite that far of a drive when we return. The Cotswolds have caught my eye but most available lodging is closer to Bath with it being so last minute. There are lots of options between Stonehenge and London but we don't want another city experience. So I guess we're wanting cute rural but with enough services to host us for the day. There is ONE hotel near the Cotswolds that an accommodate us but I thought I'd see if you all have any other suggestions before we commit. This is our first trip to England as a family so everything is game. tia ,MPB,,"Queen Creek, Arizona"

We plan to pick up an automatic transmission rental car about 10am on a Friday or Saturday after checking out of our hotel on Buchanan Street in Glasgow Centre. We will have been in Glasgow a few days so jet lag shouldn't be an issue but as we are both first time left side of road drivers (from US) we would like to practice driving a bit before we get into any really congested or higher speed areas. We have not yet rented a car but plan to do so soon for our 2 week August trip (returning car in Inverness).    I'm looking at Laurieston area or maybe Scotland St near the M8. Are either of those ok for our purposes or should we go to the Airport? We will be driving to Falkirk and Edinburgh Botanic Gardens so I hate to backtrack.

My husband and i are arriving at Edinburgh train station on a friday lunch time. We have an airport hotel booked but would like to drop our luggage at our hotel and return to Edinburgh to eat and do a little sightseeing .My question is is there a multi day ticket that allows us to travel back and forth to the airport . I looked at the luggage storage but it seems expensive as we are travelling back to the USA and will have at least 4 to 6 pieces of luggage. I thought i saw a day bus ticket for 12 pounds that allows multiple trips but not sure if it includes the airport zone . Any advice would be appreciated. ,Pippa,Edinburgh,"Dallas, Texas"

Apologies if this is not the right forum.    Currently with ID mobile. Noticed in recent weeks mobile data has become more unreliable. Final straw was when I went abroad and my mobile data whilst roaming did not work leaving me stranded late at night in a foreign country. Suffice to say I am jumping ship my usage is pretty low 20 mins calls a month max handful of texts not much mobile usage either and I pay £6 a month. Looking for something comparable or a bit more if there is nothing at that price. Would like to go with a mobile network provider I can trust to work in the EU when abroad.

Hello we are thinking about travelling up to Scotland to see the Northern lights in Jan/Feb 2024. It will be a road trip so we have a car. Can anyone recommend the best place(s) to stay to see the aurora please? Before everyone piles in yes I know a lot of luck is required dark skies clear skies no real forecast until a few hours beforehand . . . but if everything aligns . . where is best? We will have our 6 year old with us so don't really want to be dragging him around the island in the middle of the night hence recommendations for hotel/Bnb in the right locations already. We can self cater or eat out (tho pubs/restos are not our priority).  I have seen places like The Bridge BnB and Beith at the northernmost tip of Isle of Skye which I'd read was the best bet of seeing the lights on the Isle of Skye. Bizarrely tho none of the reviews mention the aurora. Could also try somewhere in Harris but don't know how that would work with our car . .  Any pointers would be appreciated as I know things book up fast if they haven't already done so. We will have around 3 days in this area. Short I know but that's all we've got!

We are in the early stages of planning a three -four week trip to England starting in mid September 2024.  We have been to London multiple times so we have already done the major tourist attractions.    We know we want to visit: Bath Stonehenge Cambridge Oxford Churchill’s home maybe the Cotswold area .    First question is there an event or area we should make our first priority. Autumn festivals theater productions we should seek out and plan around? Do you see a glaring mistake of something we will be missing? In addition We are interested in live performances comedy clubs history no later than the 1800s.    Second question: we are wanting to limit our lodgings to three maybe four. Geographically what makes the most sense. ,Margaret L,London,Georgetown
Hi everyone. My knowledge of gadgets and digital stuff is not the best. I have a dual sim cell phone and I already have a Vodafone sim card brought over for me from England. It has 7GB of data and unlimited texts / calls for 10 pounds. But I have to load the 10 pounds before I can use it! I obviously don't want to use the airport WiFi to do that for security reasons so....um....how exactly do I get this thing to work?? The sim was like 99p so I have no issue discarding it and buying a different option if someone has a better idea. I read somewhere that there is a sim shop at the airport which might do set up for me but I would prefer Vodafone just because that is what I'm on here is SA. We mainly need data for maps and transport updates. Oh and we land at 4:45am....on a Sunday... so....anything that's open!! ,CKLondon,London,
Our family of 5 will be in London over Boxing Day and would love to enjoy a football match. I've learned a Premier League match isn't realistically going to happen but are there other lower league games happening around London that day as well? Other sports besides football? Our Boxing Day plans fell through so it would be great if we could find something on that day but we also have availability on Dec 24 25 27 mid-day 28 and evening 29th (ha! Listing all those dates seems like we have nothing planned. In reality they're full but flexible).    We are staying in London near Oxford St. and won't have a car. Kids are pre-teen/teen age so moderate walking is fine.    Side note: we were in Dublin a few months ago and attended a hurling match on a whim and it ended up being a highlight of our trip. We enjoyed the sport but also in general terms of taking in the community and culture it was fantastic. We'd love to have a similarly enjoyable experience in London. ,MPB,,"Queen Creek, Arizona"

Hi brains trust! I’m looking for some inspiration for our trip to Scotland in September 2024. We’re coming from Australia 2 adults with 2 primary school aged kids. It’s pretty far away but we’re throwing around ideas for the itinerary at the moment.  So far our trip looks like this:  4 nights Edinburgh  Pick up rental car 3 nights Nairn (for Inverness Loch Ness Aviemore etc).  3 nights Mull (mum grew up here)  2 nights ???? Near Glasgow.  3 nights Crieff Hydro (family treat after all the moving around).  Fly home from Edinburgh.  It’s the 2 nights near Glasgow I’m a bit stuck on. We need to go visit my elderly aunt in Paisley (probably only an hour or 2 she tires easily) so need to be driving distance to see her but probably prefer to stay in the countryside rather than the city. We’ll have a car.  Any great ideas?  I’ve not really explored around the south west before. ,Mezzar12,Scotland,Australia

Hello    I'm planning a 10-day trip to London I'll be traveling alone. I'm planning on an apartment/studio/VRBO rather than a hotel so that I have cooking facilities. Looking at neighborhoods the ones with (affordable) availability include Bloomsbury Fitzrovia and Soho.    Priorities - safety and proximity to main sites ideally 5-10 minutes walk from Tube. I think a couple of nights I'll be going home alone from the theater so don't want to be in a neighborhood that's sketchy. Or too far - stayed in Camden Town not long ago and it felt like a bit of a trek.    I also like South Ken and Chelsea but they seem a little less well connected on the tube.

Hi all lovely people    I hope my question finds you all well.  We bought 2 Flight tickets from Dublin to Edinburgh with Ryanair from 23rd to 26th of December.  The issue is that we both have only European Economic Area IDs (EEA National IDs (Romanian and Bulgarian)) valid at the moment as both our passports are expired - and we never required to renew them as we freely travelled within Europe with them for the last 6 years (included UK back in 2019)  Has anybody flew recently from Dublin to Edinburgh without any passport control? - as we are both afraid that we might not be allowed to fly or enter UK (Edinburg).    PS: we haven't booked hotel yet.    Thank you all and happy holidays to you all.    Kind regards  PLP :) ,Love Peace And Prosperity,,"Dublin, Ireland"
Hi my son and I are going to a gig in Hackney (nr Hackney Central) and need to stay overnight to accommodate our return flight early the morning. I'm thinking that (transport-wise) Finsbury Park might be a good area to allow an easy journey between Gatwick-some sightseeing-Hackney-bed-Gatwick.    Assuming that makes sense does this sound like a reasonable idea? There is a well-reviewed flat (in a multi-storey block) minutes from the station. I'm have no familiarity with the area at all - would it be advisable for a middle-aged woman and her teenaged son to be traipsing about on their own in the wee hours?    Any and all advice gratefully received. Cheers ,rh182,London,
We have the option at flying into Heathrow at either 6:40 or 9:04 a.m.  This will be a once or twice in a lifetime trip for us so we plan to fully use that first (jet-lagged) day -- drop off luggage at our hotel and then head out to Hampton Court Palace ( or maybe Windsor instead everyone says Hampton is closer but oddly TFL indicates the trip to Windsor is faster???). Should we do the flight arriving at 9 to avoid rush hour as our first encounter with the train system or will that end up wasting the day and we should choose the earlier arrival time? Or does it matter ? Thanks for any advice you may have. ,Dallas C,London,

We are a family of 4 with two almost adults sons that are planning a trip to South England next summer.    We would like to see Tintagel Castle and some of the Cornwall Nature for a couple of days but most important would be to stay somewhere charming with great rooms and great breakfast.    Can anyone recommend a little gem ro stay at - the location is less important but would be nice to stay somewhere where there are some pubs and beautiful Nature walks in the surroundings.

Hi    I have been looking on the TFGM website on how to use the trams and how to pay for tickets and how much they are but I'm getting really confused and hope someone can help me.

Hello! We gave our daughter tickets to Starlight Express for this summer. It's actually one of he favorite shows and she's never seen it. I've been to London a few times. My daughter has never been. She's not into touristy things but is a Theatre major in college so I'm trying to build our trip around her interest. I found the comment below while searching posts. Has anyone done more than one of these so I can get an idea of a comparison? The Royal Opera House tour in Purfleet looks fabulous since my daughter loves costumes. She really loves all things theatre so I'm happy to plan several experiences. I appreciate the help!    For something theatrical in addition to a performance consider a backstage tour too. There are several to choose from: Theatre Royal Drury Lane the Royal Opera House the Royal Albert Hall the Globe Theatre and Wiltons Music Hall ,freshstart19,London,New Jersey

I'm planning on doing a very short trip to Scotland between 19-21 December.    I'm starting at Birmingham and planning on visiting Edinburgh head up to Inverness and then come back down via Loch Ness Fort Williams and then Glasgow.    At the moment on Day 1 I plan on arriving in Edinburgh at 11am and have a wander there. Then head up to either Pitlochry or the Cairngorms National Park to stay the night. Can anyone give any suggestions where to stay in the Nat Park?    On Day 2 we'll hear up to Inverness for lunch and head down to Loch Ness (any other places worth visiting nearby?) and hopefully making it to Glasgow for the night.    My day 3 will be exploring Glasgow then heading back to Birmingham.    I know it's not ideal to visit on such a tight schedule - but does anyone have any tips or recommendations? I'm also a little worried about driving conditions up near Inverness so I'd guess I need to add more journey time than what Google suggests. ,Em Smith,Scotland,"Hong Kong, China"
Hello! My family of 6 (kids 2 to 14) is heading to the UK for the summer and I’m lost on an itinerary.

Hello Fellow Travelers    I hope this message finds you in great spirits. My family (2 adults and a 12-year-old) are planning a trip to the Lake District from June 27 to July 03 2024 and we're seeking some seasoned advice to help us plan.    Transportation: We need recommendations for a reliable yet budget-friendly SUV service with a driver for our round trip from Heathrow to the Lake District and back to London city.. Any personal experiences or tips?  Accommodation & Itinerary in Lake District: We aim for a relaxed holiday enjoying local culture leisurely walks and cafe hopping.  Where to Stay: Considering 3 nights each in Keswick and Windermere. Will this cover both the tourist and hidden gems of the area comfortably?  Accommodation Preferences: Looking for spacious and comfortable stays preferably on the ground floor or in buildings with elevators due to medical advice against lifting heavy luggage. Any hotel cottage or Airbnb suggestions with great views and not too far from the town center?  Your advice will be invaluable in making our trip memorable. Thanks a million in advance!

Hey all. I am traveling from the US to Scotland in late Dec./early Jan. to visit my son who is studying in Glasgow for one year. We will be in Edinburgh for a couple days then are taking a train up to Inverness on the early afternoon of December 31 for a few days. I had heard that the Isle of Skye is a “must see” but is it worth it to take a bus tour from Inverness at that time of year if we have only one day to see it? I am becoming aware that daylight is limited at that time of year thus the question. I don’t know whether to leave this on my bucket list for now and return someday in the summer to visit this Isle. If you say nay to that trip do you have alternative “must sees” that we can do by bus on January 2 or 3? Finally I understand January is a national holiday. Can anyone tell me whether the city is completely shut down or will grocery stores restaurants and shops be open. Lots of questions I know but I haven’t been able to find answers to these particular questions. Thanks in advance for your kind assistance! ,Rose J,,
I'm planning a 9 night/10 day stay in the UK from November 1-10 2024 with kids 9 and 10. Currently I have 5 nights booked in London for the first leg then want to do a few nights outside of it towards the end. During the 5 nights I'm imagining a day trip to Stonehenge Cambridge/Oxford (one of the two or both?). Husband is an avid golfer so thought we could do a trip to Edinburgh/St. Andrews (he's the only one golfing so a day trip or a one night stay) or drive down towards Cornwall somewhere. Even considering flying out of Edinburgh if worthwhile instead of coming back to London although lugging all that luggage is a drag.    What are some thought into the time of the year regarding the weather the offerings around the towns or any other suggestions on itinerary/stays? Guessing we will have a car for Cornwall trip. Also we had a hard time finding a single room for a family of 4 to stay in London so suggestions on lodging and websites would be helpful (if holiday stay... I've heard of orangeroof as a good local site to check out).    Thank you! ,ECHOes12,,"Seoul, South Korea"
We’ve had threads before about when the leaves are changing colour for visitors who like to see it but I’ve realised that a couple of years later the dates on the posts just say “2 years ago”.    So - this post is 23 October and the warm autumn this year means that here in the south-east the yellows and oranges are only just coming in amongst a lot of rather tired green. The horse chestnuts and oaks seemed to turn a week or two back but the rest have only started to go in the past few days. A few trees seem to have gone straight from green leaved to almost bare in the recent wind and storms without bothering to change colour in between. ,Astolat,,"Guildford, United..."

Hi there    Any recommendations for a pub dinner on Christmas Eve as close as possible to the Winter Wonderland?

We have only booked onto a few rides etc the latest being 6-7pm. I an wondering if the timing is too tight and there is somewhere similar for dinner that is closer or in the other direction?

We are hoping to visit Skye May 5-8 (Portree-3 nights). The festival is Portree May 9-11. Although I know nothing about this festival it looks like Portree will be even more crowded and harder to find lodging. Is that about right? Does anyone know when people start coming to town for this festival and what town looks like for these 3 days?    Maybe I should go back to the drawing board with our tentative itinerary and look again at Mull instead. Thoughts? I know that wherever we go we won't be settling.    We arrive in Edinburgh May 1 (from Ireland) and stay 2 nights. We are then driving to Hadrian's Wall (Walltown Crags) and then circling back up north of Glasgow the following day. We will most likely stay in Moffat on May 3 and then to Glencoe on May 4.    That being said the lodging I did see available for that time was well over $225 night (in whatever currency-it was more expensive than I was expecting). I know someone mentioned in my other thread that availability often opens up after the holidays. I wonder if that availability would also be more than $170-$200/night (ish-I know exchange rates etc). Are there any suggestions for more moderately priced lodging...hotel or B&B? ,Sparks,Scotland,"Summerville, South..."

Arriving from Atlanta on Delta at T3 and connecting to a BA flight to Edinburgh at T5 on separate tickets. Have a 4+ hour connection. From my reading I will follow the signs to Flight Connections - Domestic. This includes a bus ride and I assume crossing the UK border. Then I presume dumped into T5 with a combination of International and Domestic flights.    How does BA know that I have crossed the border? Could someone use International connections never cross the border and present themselves for the Edinburgh flight? Or are the domestic and international passengers kept separate at T5? ,Paul F,London,"Palm Coast, Florida"

Hi all! We're heading to Scotland in June for Isle of Skye/North Coast 500ish. We were going to get campervan and wild camp but after reading here rethought that completely and have booked Airbnbs along the way (Staffin for 2 nights Gairloch Lochinver Oldshoremore Thurso Avoch). We'll let anyone and everyone pass us by quickly and take out more trash than we bring in. Shop/eat locally as much as possible. Really just want to blend in and enjoy the beauty.    Our goals are lots of hiking (easy/moderate as husband is a bit broken down but tough) natural beauty great drives away from the crowds as much as possible. Don't mind getting lost down a windy road or two. Boat tours to get out on the water a bit would be great.    Any great recommendations on alternative side trips off the main path hikes we must do boat tours restaurants that might not be getting the attention they deserve? Local craftsmen we should check out along the way? Historic sites that should/must be seen? Truly appreciate the pointers you can offer. <3 ,Nanett1,Inverness,Jacksonville...
Hi everyone    I'm planning a trip to London in February to see three concerts by the band the 1975. Since I'll be traveling alone I'm trying to figure out where to stay to ensure the best and safest transportation to and from the O2 Arena as well as at night. I want to feel comfortable exploring the city during the day and venturing out at night without feeling anxious and still don't want to be far away from the city center. I've never been to London alone before so I'm taking extra precautions when selecting a hotel and borough to ensure my safety.    Thank you all for your help! ,Sophie,London,
There was mention of this on a recent post so a reminder that there is no Elizabeth Line or Heathrow Express this coming weekend from London to all terminals at Heathrow Airport.

Hello I’m planning a self-drive tour of Scotland Ireland and Northern Island with my mum on 12 months. What are your must see places in Scotland? Best site for photography (landscapes and architecture)? We are trying to narrow down the places we stay to get more time in fewer places (so no rushing).    We’ve read that while maps tell us a drive may take 2 hours for example in reality it will take longer (almost double). Is this true?    We are thinking our trip will be about 30 days across the 3 places and we don’t want to just have time to drive past locations we want to explore. So advice or recommendations will be very much appreciated.    Thank you for your time ,Melanie B,Scotland,

Hi all just wanted the opinions of a couple of “experts” on here.    On Saturday Jan 20th me and the wife will be arriving at King’s Cross at 15:00 with an 5 month infant and a fair amount of luggage. We are staying at the Crowne Plaza Heathrow T4.  The wife is slightly worried about the luggage on the busy underground. I keep telling her we should be absolutely fine. She is against using the Piccadilly line as she said it would be difficult with a pushchair and it will be busy.    My plan was to get the Hammersmith and City line or the circle line to Paddington. We would then just wait patiently for the comfortable Elizabeth line. I feel this would be easier than going to Tottenham Court Road. I have had a quick look and it looks at Paddington that it depends on what line you get if there is step free access or not.    Any advice would be appreciated. ,Richard K,London,

What are your hotel recommendations for a late June trip for two nights with two adults and an older preteen? Not sure what to expect budget wise but hoping we could stay around $250 a night. I don't have specifics on nights because our flights haven't been booked but we know we will likely at minimum stay a Monday and Tuesday night with a checkout date on Wednesday. We want a safe area to stay in. Our must dos are the London Eye and the Harry Potter Studios.

We will be in Liverpool for the Arsenal match Dec 23. Looking to stay as close to City Centre as possible with not TOO much noise. My son and I could sleep in the middle of a busy street. The misses not so much LOL. We prefer higher end hotels and if so does staying on a higher floor help at all? Looking at the Holiday Inn. The Radisson Red and maybe the Liner Hotel. Or would it be better to stay like the Crowne Plaza. Logistics to Anfield match day and Lime street train station also a factor as we will be traveling from London via Train with luggage.    It is a Holiday weekend as well as a big match. But at least the match is a 3pm.    Thanks in advance for any advice. ,Brian L,Liverpool,

Hi    I'm looking at a trip around Devon next August and wanted a bit of ground truthing on my very rough plans. We got 4.5 days to do this as we have flights to catch.  We'd like to drive from Heathrow (arriving into LHR at 10.50am) to Exeter on a Sunday  Then spend a day and a half (confirmation needed) doing the Cathedral tunnels Priory and Guildhall. Stay the first night there and finish Exeter city then drive to Powderham Castle.  *Night stop* (confirmation needed?)  South Devon railway at Buckfastleigh for a round trip  Drive to Dartmouth seeing Berry Pomeroy Castle and Dartmouth Castle  Across to Plymouth and see the Royal Citadel  *Night stop* (confirmation needed?)  Then drive to see Restormel Castle (Lostwithiel)  St Catherines Castle (Fowey) St Mawes Castle (Bohortha) and Pendennis Castle at Falmouth.  If time permits go to Penzance of further to tick that box.  Flight leaves Friday at 11.40am so we'd have to be back in the area of LHR late Thursday night.    Google tells me this is 179 miles and 6 hours but I am not sure how accurate this all is.  Is doing this run feasible? We would spend probably 2 hours or so in a complete castle and much less in ruins with grass on the floor.  We don't need to see every Castle and ruin and could take one out for time spent in rural villages. We'd like to see not 'tourist' stuff but typical country villages and towns with some sort of interest.  Night stays could be in a pub no need for a Hilton Hotel.  Happy to push the hours out to make a long day if needed.    Appreciate your guidance and suggestions. ,UteBloke,Devon,"Sydney, Australia"

Our hotel is near St James' Park tube station. We would like to join the Verger Tour.    Option 1: A Tuesday morning try to get there first thing. We will have a casual lunch and then we have a London Walks tour at 14:15 starting at the Bank Tube station (I would aim to be there 15 min early).    Option 2: A Friday morning (Dec 22nd) also try and get there first thing. Our next obligation is a 17:15 Balthazar reservation before the theatre. That afternoon is flexible and we have some ideas of how to fill the time.    I like option 1 because it is earlier in our vacation (WA is an important part of our itinerary) but I am concerned that the timing is tight with our walking tour.    Option 2 feels more relaxed during that day but that is the last day we will be able to visit WA....so if anything happened I would be disappointed that we didn't get to visit.    Would appreciate any feedback! ,travelfam7700,London,"Portland, Oregon"
Hello!    My husband son and I arrive in London on Christmas Day at 2pm.    As far as I am aware public transport is closed on Christmas Day. Can anyone suggest a transfer company or taxi company I can pre-book for our transfer to Chelsea?    Thanks in advance! ,Isabelle R,,Christmas Island...
Starting Tuesday 21st November a new concourse and station exit will make life easier for the many thousands of passengers who use the station each week.    Passengers alighting for the Airport will use a new exit with eight new escalators and five lifts to ease the crowds. The new concourse will lead passengers directly into the South Terminal. For the North Terminal follow the signs for the free shuttle train.    The existing concourse will be repurposed for incoming airline passengers with extra wider gates giving more circulating space.    The new exit and wider platforms will also reduce train delays at the Station. At times the number of passengers trying to exit the platforms has caused trains to be delayed outside the station whilst the crowds clear.    https://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/news/bigger-and-better-gatwick-airport-station-to-open-on-21-november ,wirewiper,London,"Torquay, United..."
We are attending the Hearts-Rangers match on December 6. This is on a Wednesday night at 7:45pm. Staying at the Premier Inn Hub on Market Street near Waverly.    Two questions. (1) Is a taxi to Tynecastle Park before the match what you would suggest? We plan to go a couple of hours early and thinking we should grab a taxi in Central Edinburgh. Is the taxi stand at Waverly the best idea? Uber?    2) It looks like after the match the best approach is to walk to Haymarket Station and take the tram to St Andrews Square. Assuming trying to find a taxi or pile into a bus after the match might be challenging. Is this the right approach? What do you do? ,Paul F,Edinburgh,"Palm Coast, Florida"

Hi all    I'm coming down to London Town at the weekend (Sat 25th to Mon 27th Nov) with my (adult) daughter just for a mooch around. We have our days sorted and have a few ideas (courtesy of a big TA trawl) for eating out around the Earl's Court and Kensington areas.    On the off chance that we (i.e. me) have any energy left we were wondering if anyone could recommend a bar or pub with low key live music on either Sat or Sun eve?    By low key I mean nothing too formal or expensive...although we don't mind a cover charge...just somewhere to have a drink and a bit of entertainment. Maybe jazz inspired or singer/songwriter type of vibe.    I'm aware of the Piano Bar at the Royal Garden Hotel (too posh?!) Evans & Peel the Troubadour and 606 Club but I'm not sure if they're really what we want.    Any ideas? ,Walk-ng barefoot,London,North West England...
WARNING WARNING.  Do not exchange money at Gatwick Airport. You WILL be ripped-off.  I know I know “never change money at airports” but recently my wife was forced to buy 400 Euros at Gatwick due to circumstances beyond her control.  The Bank or England official rate was equivalent to £348. At a UK bank it would have cost £359 which is a reasonable £11 (4.5%) commission. The Moneycorp kiosk at Gatwick charged £407 a £59 (17%) commission. And Moneycorp have a monopoly at Gatwick so there is no competition.  So be warned. ,1Marcia,Crawley,"Mississauga, ON"

II have been lucky enough to be allocated tickets for next year's Wimbledon Tournament but I am already in despair at the cost of overnight accommodation.

We are travelling to Winchester on Friday staying on the Morn Hill caravan site (son has actually been staying there with work we are bringing caravan back on Saturday).    Since the Xmas market is opening our plan is to head straight into city when son gets back from work on Friday (so 5 ish) have an early meal and a mooch around Xmas market then head back around 9.    Ideally we want to use a P&R and would be fine getting P&R bus into city and walking back out (I know buses finish at 8) but the closest P&R - Barfield and E W - say they close at 9/7.30 respectively.    Can someone advise - is that actually gates locked time so cars cannot get out? I know we would probably easily make 9pm but I don't want to be stressed about the time.    I know there are buses to/from Morn Hill but with 4 of us P&R is much more cost effective.    Or can anyone advise any other parking options on east of the city? ,Kath6144,Winchester,"Alsager, United..."

I'm weighing between the Clermont Charing Cross or Montague on the Gardens near Russell Square. Travelling solo. Was wondering if it's safer to stay right next to the tube station with the Clermont. Or opt for a short walk (6 minutes) from tube station to the Montague hotel. I'll be walking 10000+ steps around London so it's not the walk but more for safety since I'll get back late in the evening visiting relatives or touring.

Hi we are staying 3 nights in Portree in mid-June midweek 3 sisters in late 50’s/early 60’s. We are driving from Fort William. Thoughts/Questions for our 3 days.  Day 1 drive from Ft. William to Eilean Dornon castle (outside visit/pictures only). I have drive time around 2 hours with no stops. Looks like lots of nice hikes around but we can’t do it all! Let me know if I’m missing something on this section of drive.  then continue onto Elgol for the 3 hour boat trip & hike around Loch Corusik (drive time from castle to Elgol ~ 1.5 hours?) I originally thought perhaps visiting the Fairy Pools afterwards but it looks like it is around 1.25 hour drive is this correct? If so then instead of that I was thinking of heading to Portree check into airbnb and head to Old Man of Storr hike (saving Fairy Pools for another day). Which would be best? And realistically what time should we schedule the boat trip for? 12:30?  Day 2. Trotternish loop. Fairy Glen Quiraing Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls Viewpoint. Hike Brothers Point.  Day 3. Fairy Pools (if not done earlier) Dunvegan Castle & Gardens Neist Point  Day 4: depart for Applecross & Shieldaig. (I’ll follow up on questions for that section later!)  This is a fluid plan (ie if the weather is bad on Day 1 for boat trip perhaps we head to Portree directly or to Dunvegan Castle not sure which would be best.  Any helpful ideas appreciated! ,LifesABeach60,Scotland,"Tampa, Florida"

Hello  I am attending a PL game at 2 pm in the Tottenham Stadium on 31st December next with an 11 year old and have to get to Gatwick for an 8pm flight that evening.  I'm considering 2 options after the game:  - get the Spurs shuttle bus to Wood Green and the Picadilly Line to Kings Cross St Pancras where I can get a Thameslink (1 hr) to Gatwick  - walk to Tottenham Hale and get Victoria line to Victoria where I can get a Gatwick Express (30 mins)    I prefer option 2 but am concerned that the Victoria line will be (even more) congested with revelers heading into city centre for the new year fireworks & celebrations.  So much so I am considering the (hopefully quieter) Wood Green/St Pancras option even though the onwards train to Gatwick is much slower.    I would welcome any feedback / advice -thanks ,southsiderossie,London,Ireland

We are two couples early 60s arriving early afternoon of June 29th on a flight from Bordeaux to Gatwick and plan to hire a car direct from Gatwick for 7 nights to explore a small part of Cornwall and the Cotswolds. I am thinking to drive to Salisbury the first afternoon and spending the night there visiting Stonehenge and then driving to Polperro to spend 3 nights.    I appreciate it could be a fair drive to Penzance from Polperro and the area down there (close to 2 hours?)which we should like to explore including attending the Minack Theatre but I thought we could leave early in the morning and cover a fair amount including the theatre in the evening (to watch a performance). The next day could be more the west coast or exploring/hiking the area around Polperro. This would also mean we are not too far south for driving to the Cotswolds the next day and spending 3 nights there. We will then drive to London. I am thinking of dropping the car back at Heathrow (to avoid London traffic)and getting a train to our accommodation for the next 4 nights.    I have my heart set on Polperro but if there are similar fishing villages closer to Penzance that I should consider please let me know. I understand there will not be any down time but any advice is appreciated including how realistic my ambition is on what we can achieve. Thank you I have enjoyed reading your responses to others. ,Jannnab,Cornwall,"Sydney, Australia"

Here is a guide to London's bike sharing schemes which are the fastest way around London and also generally the cheapest. Note that:    1) you are not required by law to cycle in cycle lanes but you cannot legally cycle on sidewalks unless they marked for shared use with bicycle signage  2) the police sometimes target lawbreaking cyclists (cycling on sidewalks or going through redlights) with £50 fixed penalty fines  3) there is no legal requirement to wear a helmet  4) for navigation you can use Google Maps cycle routes which give rather strange circuitous routes but work ok or Komoot which will give you cycle routes and a free map of London if you register a new account. Probably Apple's app works better than Google but I haven't tried it.    Santander cycles are the longest-established scheme.    They rely on docks the location of which can be viewed here. https://santandercycles.tfl.gov.uk/map    The drawbacks of Santander:    1. they don't have many e-bikes  2. the docks are often full which means you cannot park your bike and have to go to another dock  3. the docks may be some distance from your destination  4. the bikes don't have phone holders so it's difficult to navigate using GPS    The main advantage is that it is quite cheap at £1.65 per 30 minutes per ride or £20/month or £120/year for unlimited rides up to    Forest Cycles    The pricing is more complicated:    * £1 per journey plus 23p/minute  * but you get 10 minutes free each day (still have to pay the £1) plus can watch 3 ads for 1 minute each (expires after 8 days)  * 'bundle' costs £4 for unlimited hire fee waiver for 1 day (=24 hours) + 30 ride minutes £5 3 days (=72 hours) unlimited hire fee waivers + 60 ride minutes £9 for 5 days + 120 minutes  or £12 for 7 days and 250 minutes or £20 for 7 days and 480 minutes    You can leave the bikes anywhere except in the Borough of Camden where they must be left in designated parking zones (still better than the Santander docks because the designated parking zone can be filled with unlimited bikes) and in this case the hire fee is only 50p. The requirement to park in a designated area will be noted in the app (you will be fined £5 if you don't do this). If you park in other designated parking zones outside the Borough of Camden you are awarded 2 free minutes.    They have two models of bike the blue 'River' which is blue and has very hard ride and no phone holder and the green 'Forest' which has better ride and a phone holder.    Both are ebikes which move very easily but the motor assistance is restricted to 15.5mph and there seems to be further restrictions on going beyond this speed by e.g. going down a steep hill so pedaling makes very little difference to your speed.    Lime bikes charge slightly more i.e. £1 + 27p/minute with no free minutes £6 for 3 days + 60 minutes £11 for 5 days + 120 minutes £20 for 7 days + 250 minutes. Note that the 10 free daily minutes does make Lime quite substantially more expensive than Forest. But the bikes might be better. They do cover some parts of East London not covered by Forest and you can also get electric scooters. Their bikes have phone holders.    Tier is similar to Lime in having both ebikes & escooters. Tier have phone holders which has wireless charging capability. They charge £1+23p/minute £6 for 1 day + 60 minute pass £13 for 3 days + 180 minutes. They are banned from both the Boroughs of Southwark (perhaps not too problematic for tourists) and Camden (which covers the prime shopping and theatre areas of London). This makes them hard to recommend.    Neither Tier nor Forest operate in Hackney which has only Uber & Santander.    You don't need to install the app for Santander's bikes but it is probably easier if you do use it. The others all require their own apps. ,DunRomeIn,London,london

I am looking for a restaurant recommendation hopefully walking distance to His Majesty's Theatre.

Looking for something that would be fun prior to the show. Thank you! ,Capegirl76,London,Boston
Hey everyone    I am looking at visiting London in July for 14 days. I am considering a hotel to avoid any issues with Airbnbs however the cost is higher with less convenience.    With an Airbnb at least I can do my own laundry cook for myself etc.    Are there any issues I should know about in terms of the legalities of Airbnb in London? Here in Toronto they have are only permitted in someone's primary residence for example.    Location is not a big deal I was last in London in 2017. I stayed with family (who no longer live in London) in Kensal Green.    Does anyone have thoughts or suggestions relating to the pros and cons of Airbnb VS Hotels? ,Richard White,London,"Toronto, Canada"
We are taking our toddler to London for a little over a week. For a day trip outside of town which castle would you suggest for a day trip? Windsor or Hampton Court Palace?  He is very active and prefers to do things rather than listen to stories. So bonus points for activities like parks with play structures for kids. The highlight for him will be something outside the castle...probably not inside the castle. We plan to be there Nov/Dec 2024.    Note: We are well aware of British weather. We are from Washington State in the USA and have all the rain gear we can possibly need. Definitely will check the weather for a dry day tho. ,Sarah H,London,

We're booked to visit during the christmas season (11-13th Dec) arriving at Manchester Piccadilly    We're looking at accommodation at the moment but can't work out how far away places are from each other or whether you can use trams to get between areas? We have been looking at the CitySuites at the far side of the river from the Cathedral - can see that they're close to the Arndale Centre but shopping shopping isn't my favourite pastime! I'd rather see other things in Manchester that I won't see anywhere else. I also want to make sure we can get to places to good places to eat in the evening without walking for miles    I have problems with my feet so am trying to cut down unnecessary walking from hotels to central areas - a real problem with city breaks! Very happy to look at other accommodation in other areas if it makes sense up to about £400    Many thanks ,sarah-on-her-hols,Manchester,"Highworth, United..."

Hi All i need to get from London to Reading on 7 Dec. So had GWR tickets from Paddington. But now due to planned strike it looks like that route may not be a sure thing and unfortunately my plans are not flexible (travelling for work). I THINK my two options are an expensive Uber/taxi or the Elizabeth Line avoiding the Paddington GWR routing. I THINK if I get the Elizabeth at Liverpool street (staying by Bank) while the trip takes over an hour it will get me to Reading. And as I have a fair amount of luggage Liverpool does have elevators to the platform. This is what I have found using Google but was hoping someone might be able to validate that this is all accurate? Any suggestions are welcome and thank you in advance for your assistance! ,2Lucky,London,"Chicago, Illinois"

This is more of a hey you should know more than anything else. I am a seasoned traveler (not the gypsy type) and typically research each spot we are going to avoid just such a conflict. The conflict being that the Traveler Horse Show/Gypsy Horse Fair occurs twice annually in Stow and has for over 500 years. Unfortunately every pub inn and place to stay shuts down for about a week due to issues that have occurred in the past. Only after arriving in Stow and finding our hotel (The Porch House) closed did we find out about this horse fair. Searches on line afterward picked up only one thread here on Trip Advisor (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g186290-c125169/Stow-On-The-Wold:United-Kingdom:The.Gypsy.Horse.Fair.html) and a small article on a Cotswolds site (https://www.cotswolds.info/blogs/gypsy-horse-fair.shtml). If you are into horses this could be a great thing for you.    Only advice I would give before booking in Stow on the nearest Thursday to May 12th and October 24th if if they will be open. ,Angelo S,Stow-on-the-Wold,"Hilliard, Ohio"
‘Beginning of end’ for the Dark Hedges as report calls for felling of dangerous trees‘    ‘A DUP councillor has said removing trees from the Dark Hedges could mark “the beginning of the end” for the beauty spot.    Mervyn Storey spoke out after a report commissioned by Department for Infrastructure called for the felling of 11 dangerously unstable trees.    The study by experts at Tree Safety found that of 80 surveyed trees 30 were in fair condition with the vast majority of the rest in a poor state and one dead.    According to the Coleraine Chronicle the investigation said 11 trees should be removed but because six are subject to tree protection orders council consent is required.    The matter is to be discussed by the council today.    Mr Storey a member of the Dark Hedges Preservation Trust acknowledged the report’s findings but pointed to an investigation carried out by his group that suggested only four or five trees needed to be removed.    “There is a discussion ongoing between the findings of the two reports and we will find a conclusion as to the number of the trees which will need to come down” he said.    “It’s [about] trying to keep something alive that has been in the intensive care unit for a good number of years.    “These trees are not going to last for ever and we’ve already lost a considerable amount as a result of weather and natural circumstances.”    https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/beginning-of-end-for-the-dark-hedges-as-report-calls-for-felling-of-dangerous-trees/a1394788884.html ,Kesh_grammy,Northern Ireland,Province of...

Hi everyone. Thanks for all the info I've gained lurking in the background.    We land at Heathrow Terminal 5 on the 17th December at 4:45am. My plan was to take the Elizabeth line to Paddington which is near our hotel. I was just trying to check times on Google Maps and TfL now and noticed that the Elizabeth line doesn't come up as an option. Seems there is partial closure that morning. Both websites / apps are giving me very convoluted alternatives. Is it best to take the Piccadilly line and change over or should I just bite the bullet and take the Heathrow express? We don't really have time constraints on getting into London (first on the agenda is the Science Museum at 10am). The Heathrow express is obviously more costly but if the other alternatives are really a big hassle with luggage and a 9-year old in tow then I will consider it.    Thank you for the help! ,CKLondon,London,

Hi all!    We are travelling to Scotland next summer and I would like to do a load of laundry the couple of days that we are in Glasgow. The flat that would really be perfect has a washer but no dryer. There is another unit with a dryer but we would be much more cramped there. Do you think the clothes would hang dry indoors in a day in Glasgow weather in June? We have a flight to Ireland the next day and I don't want to be packing up damp clothes! I have hung clothes to dry in Europe before but outside and in warmer less humid weather. I asked the host what he thought and he suggested turning on the radiators in the flat and hanging the clothes on them for a couple of hours. Is that a good idea? It doesn't sound very safe to me but maybe that's how it done; we wouldn't leave them unattended.    As much as I don't want to pick a less desirable flat for a dryer I even less want to be packing up a bunch of damp clothes in our luggage. It will be June but I'm guessing it will still be fairly humid and cool. It's Scotland! I would appreciate any input you have. Thank you! ,Travelingmom2three,,Stevenson Ranch...
Hi    Please don't tell me how stupid I am I already know.    My sons passport has expired. We go in holiday in 10 days (Monday 20th June).

Is there anyway we can get around this? Willing to pay whatever. Will there be any urgency or fast track seeing as he is 16 and the only one who will not be able to come? Will they fast track due to the date of our holiday? Can I do anything to speed up the process?

Hi all!    We are five adults travelling to Scotland next summer. Is a Vauxhall Zafira Tourer large enough for us and our five large suitcases? We may have a few backpacks as well but i am not as worried about that as they could be on laps or at feet if needed.

My family comes from Pendeen so planned to look around this area to see Pendeen Cadgwith Penzance Lands End St Ives ST Micheals Mount Mousehole Minack Theatre and Cadgwith Cove. I am hopeful that 4 days is enough.  I was thinking of travelling from Penzance to Port Isaac Tintagel Castle and Bodmin Moor but that looks like too long a drive and too much for one day.  Then I had thought we could leave Penzance visit Lost Gardens of Haligan on the way to Polperro. Stay 2 nights in Polperro and this would include the Eden Project.  We will then drive to Devon.  Does this look doable? I wondered whether we should reduce one night in Penzance and stay somewhere further North to avoid a long day driving to Port Isaac? If so where would you suggest?

Just wanted to warn anyone wanting to use Easy airport parking at Manchester to not bother. They arrived an hour late on the drop off which meant we had to run through to departure and on pick up found damage to rear quarter and when i reported it to the office they just gave me a load of b@llsh#t and basically told me to do one as well as unplugging my dashcam so tgere was no evidencewhat a shower of sh#t. Never going to use meet and greet again after looking into most of them they have no insurance therefore don't give a monkeys if they damage your car even after i took pictures on drop off of all four corners all wheel and mileage.

Hello all!  I am going to spend New Year's Eve in London for the first time and I am looking for restaurant recommendations for dinner.  It will be me and my boyfriend (in our 20's) and our families (parents in their 50s and little sister with 12 years old).  We are looking for a restaurant in the city centre with a set menu of up to £75 per person. If there are any good deals where we can see the fireworks from the restaurant we can go above our budget.  Our plan so far is to have a nice meal in the city so that we can then go to Cannon Street to watch the fireworks (for free). Other locations we may consider to watch the fireworks are The Millennium Bridge Tower Bridge or Parliament Hill.  Any recommendations? My ideas so far are Côte The Botanist Circolo Popolare and the Ivy. Any more recommendations (we don't care about the cuisine) welcome!! ,Ines S,London,

London and GB history experts: My SO and I will be in GB (England and Scotland) for two weeks this upcoming spring. We will start our journey with a trip to the country to visit my family's origins before they emigrated in 1635. Then 5 days in London 2 days in Edinburgh 5 days in the highlands and back to London for a day at Windsor and then back to the states.    My question is about a starting point in London. We plan to do the normal tourist spots including Westminster Abbey Westminster Palace St. Paul's the Tower the War Rooms the area around Buckingham and some museums.    I would like to start with a good museum that shares the history of England/GB/the UK. Is there one museum that walks one through the history from the Roman days through today?

Mu husband and I are thinking/dreaming of a tour of gardens and stately homes churches etc. in May 2024. I realize this is a lot to ask but can anyone suggest a central town or two where we could base ourselves? We are senior citizens and absolutely do not drive in England anymore (been there done that) but we have traveled in the past using a central town as a base and using public transport and taxis to get around. West Sussex has such an abundance of desirable attractions that we are really puzzled about the best place to set up a base. We generally like hotels or guesthouses that have locations near good restaurants and are medium priced ($225-300) per night. We have traveled often in Great Britain and my husband was a graduate student at Manchester years ago. We are not exactly dumb Yanks but we would really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks very much for any and all advice! ,Norman V,West Sussex,Roseville...
I don't find TripAdvisor easy to use these days.    Any experienced Leicester locals/visitors advise:    Any decent modest family run style curry houses in a particular area? Are they mostly Pakistani Bangladeshi or other styles (Sri Lankan?). Any comparison to Birmingham/Bradford?  Can one get a desi breakfast in Leicester?    Any good parks or nature reserves botanical or community gardens?    Oh and taprooms? And any red brick ex-industrial architecture (derelict mills)?    Last holiday was in Bradford/Salt/Bingley which was an absolute cracker.  Previously enjoyed Brummy but getting a bit over-developed now.    Thanks in advance for any summary answers. ,pale,Leicester,london

Wife and I are planning to visit Scotland for 10 days next July. Most likely will be flying in/out of Edinburgh. I have 2 ideas for planning out this trip and wondering which way I should go.    Plan A - Stay 2 days in Edinburgh get a rental car and venture out westward and perhaps stay somewhere between Edinburgh and Isle of Skye for 1-2 days (Glencoe Glenfinnan Ft Williams that general area). Then continue on and stay a few days at Isle of Skye. Then travel back to Inverness and stay 2 days. Then return to Edinburgh for a final day and fly home.    Plan B - Split my stay only between Edinburgh and Inverness take the train between the 2 cities then do daily bus trips/tours to all the various places we want to go to (most of these are listed in the TripAdvisor top picks list.    My biggest / only concern is the driving and added stress involved with that in alot of the narrow mountain roads througout Scotland. But it does provide added freedom to go and do as you please vs. being captured by the intinerary of a bus/day tour. ,Rob55,Scotland,"Frederick, Maryland"

Hello my friends. Back again. What is your take on the Fawlty Towers immersion dinner. We loved the show and know things may be dated. I just saw a couple of old reviews saying it had a lot of profanity. I’m not a prude but would prefer wit and cleverness a la Cleese to low talking. What have you experienced.  Also wanted to see a musical and or something funny. Would love Noises Off but it ends before we come in April. I’ve finally just seen (nothing like being late to the party) Lion King. Costumes magnificent. Feedback on Back to the Future? We have pretty broad tastes. I know Les Mis is wonderful but I don’t want to feel teary eyed. Two 50 year olds and 78 year old mom.  Also what is theatre is near Sarasto restaurant? Is a Friday night good for Ronnie Scott’s?  Phew. Asking a lot…relying on your good graces!….Rosie ,bowfant,London,"Reno, Nevada"

Hello friends :) I will be traveling to London from Brussels with my brother’s two cats. From what I have investigated so far I know that I need to fill in the non-commercial declaration form. But as I am not the owner it says that I need to have a written permission from the owner (my brother) to accompany the pets. I cannot find any sample for that letter and I don’t know whether it should be a particular form of just a letter written by my brother.  I would be grateful if someone could share their valuable experience with me. Thanks in advance! ,Sevil E,,

Scotrail has announced an increase to it's previous Boxing Day services.    https://www.scotrail.co.uk/about-scotrail/news-press-releases-latest-news-media-release/scotrail-spreads-christmas-spirit0    Customers will be able to take advantage of extra Christmas services this year with ScotRail delivering a bumper Boxing Day timetable boost.    Traditionally services on Boxing Day have been restricted to a very small number mainly in the Strathclyde area.    But this year trains will also run to and from Perth Dunblane and Glenrothes and between Bathgate and Edinburgh giving more people the chance to travel to see family and friends at this special time of year.    The additions to the Boxing Day services include:    Bathgate to Edinburgh.Glasgow to Alloa.Edinburgh to Dunblane.Edinburgh to Glenrothes via Dunfermline.Edinburgh to Perth via Kirkcaldy.    The train operator is running as many services as possible throughout the festive period with only Christmas Day and New Year’s Day seeing no trains running.    As has been the case in previous years the last trains of the day on both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve will depart earlier than normal so customers should plan ahead.    Full details of the changes will be published on the ScotRail website in the coming days.    The ScotRail app has now been updated with all services expected to operate on Boxing Day and customers can check there or the website to plan their journey. ,Ale-to-the-Chief,Scotland,"Glasgow, United..."

Hello.  I haven’t changed planes in Heathrow for many years.  I have an upcoming journey arriving at LHR from Edinburgh into Terminal 5 and having to transfer to Terminal 3 to fly home to Canada.    It says on the website that you have to take a Tube train for no charge between the two terminals and it takes 20 minutes.  It also says you need an Oyster card or a contactless pay card.  Is this the only way to get between the two??  What if you don’t have either of these things then what?!  Please help.  Thank you. ,SMJ,,Canada

I suggested wetherspoons as it is a budget option but I've never liked those pubs as they lack all atmosphere in my opinion.

There will be two of us and we will have a medium sized suitcase each and probably a backpack. I know the train will come into Kings Cross Station. Obviously a cab will be the quickest option but not the cheapest. From what I can tell the Northern Line will then take us to Lambeth North. Is this correct?

I am flying 07.55 from Manchester Airport with a party of 4 and have seen that Ryanair are now offering a twilight hold luggage drop off service between 19.00-22.00 the night before. Other than that I am struggling to find any detail. Looking at other Airports where the service is offered it seems that the lead passenger needs to go with boarding pass and passports for everyone whose bag is being dropped off. If anyone has used this service at Manchester can they confirm this is correct?  Question 2 - do people think this is wothwhile doing? Parking costs at Manchester are ridiculous and I think I am looking at a £20 parking fee for up to 1 hour requored to drop off the bags. Or are the luggage drop off facilities good enough that we can just do this on the morning of the flight and still get through security in plenty of time?

Hi all I would be really grateful if you could help me with where to stay for a night and your recommendation for a fantastic half day hike to do the following morning for a first timer to the Cairngorms. I really wish I had more time but we want to make the most of the short amount of time we have so looking for a great half day hike that has stunning scenery.    We will be traveling from the Isle of Sky via Loch Ness to the Cairngorms or one night. That will be a big day so I expect that we will arrive to the Cairngorms quite late in the afternoon. The following morning we hope to do a half day hike before departing to Stirling for the following night (this looks to be a 2.5 hour drive).    What would be the best 1/2 hike for a couple in their mid 50's (we are reasonably fit but we are looking for a hike that is easy to medium rather than super hard) with stunning scenery and I was just hoping for recommendations of the best towns to stay in for easy access (given our short time frame) to the hikes you recommend. We will have our own car.    Thanking you in advance. ,Robyn Geering,Scotland,"Canberra, Australia"

We just booked an incredible airfare (although date restrictive) from NC US to Inverness next Spring. We are 2 couples in our 60s who have been to Edinburgh but wanted to see the highlands as well. We do not want to rent a car so we will be dependent upon public transportation. Therefore we would like recommendations for accommodations in the City Center so we can walk and/or ride buses. I have searched hotels vrbos and the like. We really prefer an apartment so we can all stay together. Stairs are ok unless our booking is 4 flights up. Two of our group are very active while my husband and I enjoy a good stroll but nothing too strenuous. I imagine we will go our separate ways some days. I would love to hear your thoughts on this. We plan to take some day tours through Rabbies which we very much enjoyed in Edinburgh so it would be really convenient to be within walking or bus distance from the Cathedral.

Hello all    I thought I'd post some recent information regarding UK passport renewal using their Premium same day service - with added info for ex-pats.    I'm a British ex-pat living in The Netherlands and didn't relish the idea of posting my passport for renewal (technically it's my official ID so should have it available here). So as I had a few days planned in the UK (London) I booked a premium (same day) passport renewal.  Note that passport renewal is different per country - check the gov.uk website to see what process applies from your country (if you're lucky it might be a visit to the local embassy!).    The online process is very straight forward BUT it asks if you're living in the UK. If you answer no it will reject you. So use a family member for your UK address.  With regards to uploading a photo the instructions on the gov.uk website are very clear. And when you upload the photo it does a check so you know if it's OK or not.  You need to pick a time to pickup the new passport but can only do that 2 weeks in advance. That said I found plenty of availability after the first couple of days. In other words if you book 2 weeks ahead you'll get your preferred date time and office location.  And finally payment.    The actual appointment was a breeze. Security checked my appointment number (received with confirmation of the appointment and payment); then a quick airport-style security check.Followed by 5 minutes with a nice gent who checked my old passport (that's the only thing you need to bring) cut the corner off then gave me my new passport. All done in 10-minutes. (And no check of my fake UK address!).  It's possible to have someone else pickup your passport - check the gov.uk website to see how that works.    The downsides?  Extra cost. If you renewing from abroad it's 114 GBP (incl courier costs) this fast-track service is currently 194 GBP.  The London office is now in the Docklands (next to the Excel centre) so it's a bit of a trek to get there. (Other offices might be easier for you / closer).    There's also a 1-week Fast-Track service for 153 GBP where it gets posted to a UK address. If you were going to be staying with family or friends that might be another option though you'll need to be there to sign for receipt.    Hope this helps! ,empathology,,"Rotterdam, The..."

This one is not easy for me but back in June I was seriously injured and busted up pretty good in an accident.

Get on get off no big deal. Well now I can forsee sometimes the need to sit down and if I sit my leg is extended and in the aisle and I just don't want to be in the way burden people or offend anyone because I know at some point some one might have to step over me.

I'd like to get the thoughts from you Scotland experts - our original plan was for a 9'ish day in early May (or possibly last week of April).    Basic itinerary is: 2 days in Edinburgh 1 day coach trip into the Highlands (from Edinburgh) 2 days in Oban (1 of those days is day trip to Mull/Iona/Staffa) then 1 day Glasgow.    We are considering postponing to first week in September. Looking for thoughts on how that would impact our trip given where we want to go? I see in September sunset is a little earlier than in May but it looks like temperature (on the average) not too much different.    If you were giving a recommendation which would you suggest?

Hello my husband and I are planning a trip to England and visiting Edinburgh. We have visited twice before but not since 2017. We will have just over four weeks. We would like 2-3 days in London  to see Portsmouth and a couple of other different things to see and do.  This time we would like to visit Bath Liverpool lakes district York Whitby and continue our journey up to Northumberland  and finish in Edinburgh we are flying in and out of London. Would be happy to stay and base ourselves if possible to cover other places on list if nearby having a hire car  Just not sure which way to head first  Would appreciate any suggestions and thank you for your time ,cassandra1984,England,"Sydney, Australia"
Hello all!  We are leaving next week for London. In the past we have always stayed at the Rubens at the Palace so we used the underground entrance to Victoria Station that is directly across from Shake Shack/Nova Building. This year we are staying in Eccleston Square. What is the closest entrance to that area easiest to get to etc.? I saw online that the Terminus Place entrance to Victoria Station is closed until 23 December but I'm not sure that will effect us?  Thanks for your help! ,Kristy T,London,Alabama

We will be a family of three (2 adults and 10yr kid) planning to visit sometime during summer. My daughter is a very big fan of HP and she has visited all the attractions in US related to HP. We have friends staying close to London so were thinking of doing a HP trip and visit some locations where the movie was shot. I have searched online and a list showed up with all the locations.  I did put it in the Google map and they seem to be going all the way to Scotland.    I am sharing the locations: Lacock Abbey Lacock Chippenham  Gloucester Cathedral  BodleiDurham Cathedral Durham  Alnwick Castle Alnwick  Glenfinnan Viaduct Glenfinnan    I do not know if all locations will be worth visiting (considering time and money)    Any suggestions are welcome on planning : what to do/how many days/ how to visit those locations/ transportation/lodging.    We also plan on spending may be 3 days to visit places in London and also Stonehenge.    Please suggest a doable Itinerary and also any information on the trip cost and transportation is a big plus. We do not want to be too extravagant in our spending. Initially thinking of 7-8 days for the trip.    Thank you ,SXB_12,England,"Houston, Texas"

Hi all    My wife and I plan to be on the Isle of Man for 3.5 days in July. I have a solid idea of what I want to see and do (I'll post draft itineraries for each day for review later) and so I've started thinking about what I should eat - and where to eat it. Hope I can get some guidance here from people who have eaten on the Isle of Man before me.    When I watch videos of Manx people talking about food on the Isle of Man the two things they mention most are queenies (which I understand to be a local species of scallop) and the kipper bap (which I understand to be a smoked herring sandwich) - it sounds like both of these are extremely common on the Isle and sold both in restaurants and as street food and I should have no problem finding either. According to one video there is a small restaurant called the Fish Bar Delicatessen by the shore in Peel where I can get either.    Wikipedia informs me that the Isle of Man has something very similar to Canadian poutine called chips cheese and gravy - given that I got food poisoning from poutine in Montreal a decade ago I'm not sure I want to try it but my wife may want to. This one also looks like it is available all over.    I don't think I'll have the opportunity to see a live Loaghtan sheep at Cregneash. Maybe I will have an opportunity to eat one? Is there a particular place I should go if I want to eat a local lamb?    According to both Google Maps and TripAdvisor the best restaurant on the Isle of Man is Aura Bar & Bistro in Douglas with a 4.8/5.0 on Google and a near-perfect 5/5 on TA. It looks to be a contemporary fusion-y Indian restaurant and the menu looks exciting: I don't think I've ever seen tandoori masala ribeye steak on a menu before anywhere in the world. I am also told that Davison's in Peel is the best ice cream on the island.    Overall my eating plans look something like this:    DAY 1 (Thursday):  - lunch is whatever Aer Lingus serves on my flight  - dinner in Douglas likely at Aura Bar & Bistro    DAY 2 (Friday):  - I need a quick lunch in southern Douglas ideally something that takes no more than a half hour  - I probably need a quick dinner in Castletown or Port Saint Mary - I'll have an hour or so to eat dinner (weather permitting I'd like to take a boat trip around the Calf of Man on Friday night this leaves at 6:00 PM from Port Saint Mary)    DAY 3 (Saturday):  - I will be in Laxey for lunch. I plan to eat at the Ballacregga Corn Mill Tea Room & Restaurant.  - I should have plenty of time in the evening for a relaxing dinner somewhere in Douglas    DAY 4 (Sunday):  - I need a quick lunch in Peel between Peel Castle and the House of Mananan - sounds like we can get something from the Fish Bar Delicatessen and maybe an ice cream at Davison's afterwards  - For dinner I should have time to go anywhere on the island - this will be our last night on the Isle of Man and I'm happy to do something fancy. I hear that Sunday Roast is a big thing?    Happy to take recommendations for any of these things! Let me know what I should eat and where I should eat it. ,Bruce A,Isle of Man,Washington DC...
We are working on our travel arrangements for the 2024 British Open. Having recently been to the Ryder Cup we were hoping to avoid the congestion of the train stations and wonder if travel from Glasgow to Troon is workable with a taxi. If I am reading the map correctly it looks like a 40 mile trip each way. Thoughts? We do not wish to rent a car and will be staying in Glasgow for three nights. ,Bernice,Glasgow,"Clearwater, Florida"

The draft bill is here https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/52905/documents/3979 and covers that TFL may provide for:    * licensing  * the fact that many of the current drivers are illegally in the UK and/or illegally working  * display of licence numbers  * regulating fares  * allowed equipment (for example restrictions on pedicabs which currently cause a public nuisance with their noise)  * prohibit them from working in certain areas    Currently the pedicabs are unregulated and can (and do) rip-off tourists as hard as they like by charging hundreds of pounds for short journeys riding illegally in very crowded pedestrianized areas and so on.    It is hoped that the eventual licensing regime will reduce the current menace posed by these vehicles. ,DunRomeIn,London,london
I'm thinking of buying a ticket from Amsterdam to Isle of Man in May.  Easyjet sells this as self transfer tickets. I'm a bit anxious for this.  Arriving from Amsterdam if on time gives me 2.25 hours to catch the plane to Douglas (Isle of Man).  As I arrive from Amsterdam I assume i do need to do customs security and possibly check-in (if not online). Will this all be doable in 2.25 hours or will it be tight/stressfully?

Hey everyone!    As I noted in another post I am planning a trip to London in July and have the option to fly with British Airways (or Air Canada) into Heathrow. I can also take Air Transat into Gatwick.    Previously I took Air Transat into Gatwick to save money but I found the Airport to be a tad lacking. It was easy enough to get into the city however I was not entirely impressed.    My thinking is at least with Heathrow there are more options to get there and/or back if things go sideways. There are also more creature comforts while waiting.    Any recommendations for which airport to go through? ,Richard White,London,"Toronto, Canada"

On the 18/10 myself and myBF stayed at the Intercontinental O2 London… after a Madonna gig.  We packed suitcases up went for breakfast. Checked out . Then left the hotel. When we got home we realised somebody had stolen stuff from our suitcases. Because the suitcases are all packed ready to go. We didn’t realise this until we got home.  I’ve contacted the hotel. Security are denying that anybody went into our room. And after three weeks of trauma the hotel are now ignoring me. I even emailed the CEO of the UK. I got a reply but now no one is replying  I’m at my wits end for to do? Does anybody else have any advice for me? The hotel are denying that anybody went in our room. But the bottom line is we’ve had stuff stolen… ,justwantgoodfood2018,London,Buckinghamshire...

I recently visited West Byfleet after many years. A pretty town but with a tower block sticking out in the middle. Nontheless the trees along the main path and surrounding seem to obsure it and the town was a nice place to visit.  Now what a shock it is unrecognizable! All the beautiful trees gone and a massive ugly development complex built right up to the path. It is another  It is not a town as such but an enormous block of flats like Addlestone type complex next to a railway station. with a few restaurants.    It is not regneration of town.

Hello -    I'd love to get your thoughts on our road trip and in particular how many nights in each locale.  We're traveling in early March for 11 days starting and ending in Manchester. Manchester because I'll be in Manchester for work and it's more budget-friendly to fly in/out of Manchester and return our car rental to the same location.    Here is the itinerary we're considering:    Manchester - depart  Galloway Forest Park - 1 night  Glasgow - 1 night  Isle of Skye - 2 nights  Inverness - 2 nights (base for day trips)  Edinburgh - 2 nights  Windermere - 1 night  Manchester - 1 night    We're not sure where to base in Isle of Skye just yet so taking recommendations. We like off the beaten track locations the less touristy the better even though I know we're tourists as well ;-). We like hiking photography birding and castles.    Any and all input is greatly appreciated - thank you!    Lori ,Lori H,Scotland,"Raleigh, North..."

Hello am traveling to Scotland in December kindly advise me any good trekking spot near glencoe and Aberdeen area. ,Zain Explorer,Scotland,"Dubai, United Arab..."
Greetings    Please help! I’ve been consumed by wondering why Manchester hadn’t appeared on my radar until a few weeks ago. It looks exactly like the sort of place that I’d enjoy. Earlier this week I booked tickets for what turns out to be a five and a half day trip to the area. My trip begins in about a month.    What I find so appealing are the art museums the non-art museums such as the People’s History Museum the libraries The Factory or its corporate name and the industrial revolution/post-industrial feel of the place. (Or maybe I’ve just been under the spell of some competent city tourism PR department!)    Liverpool also look good. The dock area looks great (although I wonder if it’ll be a bit too touristy). Of course I’d like to see the Tate Modern; the Maritime Museum looks like it has fascinating exhibits as does the art museum. And while I get pretty quickly “churched-out” when I travel I guess that the cathedral is worth more than a peek.    On top of that I’m into food much more of the street and farmer’ markets varieties than those that have or want to have Michelin stars.    What I don’t care much about is nightlife things being “child-friendly” shopping football and while I enjoy the music of the Beatles it’s never been my dream to get on a Magical Mystery Tour bus.    So given what you know do I split my time in half? Two and a half days for Liverpool three for Manchester? Stay in Manchester with a long day trip to Liverpool? Something else? And should this be cross-posted to the Liverpool forum?    I look forward to your wisdom! Thanks. ,baltoellen,Manchester,"Baltimore, Maryland"

I am applying for tourist visa to Finland and have been trying hard for the last one week to get an appointment. No slots open and with no responses from VFS global I approached the embassy. Embassy staff are very helpful - they make the VFS global answer me - but their response is completely irresponsible. Consulate staff intervened twice till now - although VFS global sent me an email for manual appointment - they clearly have marked it as one customer ticket - but I want for two in my family (which I asked in my email). Again I have emailed them asking if their response covers both members of my family. Their Twitter is responded once a day - with a response that they will pass my question to right people. I called their premium line that took my 3 GBP but only heard all the menu options and wait for customer representative. My question now is - will that single customer ticket valid for both my family members or they are going to allow only one of us.

Doable? Suggestions? Is Uber a safe choice for the trip back to Heathrow on a Saturday afternoon? I am only planning 2-3 hours of sight seeing at a fast pace.    Thank you. ,Omzee64,,

Please offer suggestions. My SO and I will be arriving in London the evening of Friday May 3. Current plan is to take the train to Slough and stay at the HIE near the station. Saturday May 4 have first tickets for the castle see the changing of the guard tour the castle and then attend evensong that evening at the chapel. That evening head back to London.    From my review of things to do in Windsor the castle is the primary attraction for us other than wandering the streets and shops and possibly walk through Eton a little. The horse show sounds interesting but as an extemely casual observer with little interest in horses it's fairly pricey to say we went.    Will the horse show cause too much chaos for us to enjoy the castle tour? Will one day allow us to see the castle Eton and the shops (we are NOT shoppers so this will be brief).    Thanks to all for your advice! ,Illiniwek66,Windsor,Bloomington-Normal...

Hi . I am thinking of travelling from Ireland to London for winter wonderland with my 8 year old daughter. We are thinking of going between Christmas and New year. Is this a good time to go ?

We have only taken one train before from London to Birmingham which I think was 3-4 hours. The trip from Edinburgh to Liverpool is much longer. What does one do about eating on a long train ride? I don’t recall any food available on the train we took before. Do you bring food along with you? I couldn’t find any info on this.    Any other info on the trains is appreciated as well. I can’t recall if we just bought tickets at the station on the Birmingham train ride. Is it better to buy in advance? We have no strict schedule. In both cases we would just be leaving our hotels in the morning and heading to the station. We are fairly familiar with the London tube but only the one train trip (we took a bus back because it was late after a Madness concert). Thank very much! ,Zibon T,,"Alpharetta, Georgia"

So we’re (40yo wife and 20 month old) heading up for 2 days (end of Nov) and due to the toddler napping at noon we’re not really doing any big activities. So on the radar currently is dynamic earth santaland and the castle but are there any other quick n easy interesting attractions in and around the 2 main streets that we could do as we’re shopping/passing?    Thankyou ,Boniouk,Edinburgh,"Lancaster, United..."
Hi!

Hey all how much should I expect to pay for a taxi from the airport to old Trafford mid week? ,apples2008,Manchester,Ireland
this company are scammers- they buy space in the NCP car park at Portland Terrace and then send a taxi eventually to take you to and fro the ship. I waited an hour at the beginning and end of my cruise for the ride. Avoid. ,spending pension,Southampton,"Lincoln, United..."
We (2 adults no children) are flying to Cologne from Terminal 5 with BA on a Saturday morning and are considering staying overnight on the Friday preferably taking advantage of the evening bag drop. We would need 5 nights parking and preferably breakfast. We have done this many times at LGW but the Heathrow options don't seem so straight forward!  If we park/stay off site we'd have to pay to park and drop off bags in the evening and then get a shuttle not ideal. If we park and stay at T5 the only hotel option is the Sofitel which is pricier.  Wondering whether it would be best to park at T5 drop bags off and then transfer to a hotel at another terminal via HE returning to T5 in the morning - if this is a good plan suggestions of easily accessible hotels would be appreciated.  Another option would be to park and stay at another terminal but this way we'd have to head to T5 to drop off bags go back to the hotel etc etc which seems long winded. Does the HE go straight from T5 to other car parks?  How long is the queue likely to be for bag drop on the Sat morning - long enough to justify the evening drop off?  Any other suggestions welcomed although tend to prefer being on-site so we are able to head to terminal under own steam in the morning - once had a taxi that didn't turn up for 5 of us!😱 ,Catherine K,London,
Hi there    We have a fairly important appointment in London Trafalgar Square towards the end of October at around 10.30am. I thought whilst were down doing this why not combine this with a short holiday so I booked a week in Essex on Mersea Island thinking Essex is close enough to London so it should be easy enough to travel in. Now I'm thinking it's not going to be as easy or cheap as I'd first imagined.    From googling a bit I'm thinking my potential options are:    1) Driving to Epping and taking the direct tube to Tottenham Court Road. Walk to Trafalgar Sq. This appears to be the cheapest option - about £30 for 2 adults and child and I can see there's a fairly big car park nearby.  2) Driving to Colchester Station and taking the train to Liverpool St then Tube to Tottenham Court Road. Walk to Trafalgar Sq. £68 for 2 adults and child. Not sure about parking.  3) Driving to Witham Station and taking the train to Liverpool St then Tube to Tottenham Court Road. Walk to Trafalgar Sq. Most expensive option £128 for 2 adults and child. Not sure about parking.    These are just the online prices I've found no idea if any of these are the most ideal route so I'm wondering if anyone who's local or knows the areas well can advise on what might be best or at least better then the above? Would be thankful for your recommendations. ,Fraser C,London,
Does anybody have an opinion on the best value seats? Lowest prices are 26.20GBP behind the stage up to 61.40 for some of the boxes. This isn't a must-do for us but seemed interesting so wanted to pay closer to the lower end of the spectrum. ,DaytonJG,London,"Centerville, Ohio"
We've been to London a couple of times and have seen most of the traditional attractions. For our next visit I'd love to find some attractions that are a bit off the beaten track - unusual and interesting.    We'll be traveling with our kids - 11 and 19 - so bonus points for anything that would appeal to the younger set.    Thanks in advance for any insight. ,jsned,London,Los Altos...

Hi there    My friends and I are planning a trip to Cardiff. The only issue is that we are all under 18 years old. Does anyone know of any (preferably cheap) places to stay near the Cardiff Central train station? For reference there would be four of us.    Many thanks. ,James,Cardiff,
Hi all! Your suggestions were helpful in a previous post.    Planning a trip for next June and need to book accommodation for 3 adults for 3 nights on either Skye or Mull.    Itinerary:  Fly into Edinburgh and head to Falkirk night 1    Stirling Castle to Helensburgh nights 2-3. I’m from Clan Colquhoun and want to spend a few days near Loch Lomond.    From there either Oban - Mull or Glencoe - Skye for 3 nights.    We are wary of enormous crowds on trails and the like but hate to miss all of the incredible spots on Skye. My parents took me in 2004 and we barely left the car the entire trip so I definitely want to spend time outdoors enjoying the landscapes in person. Don’t have to be long hikes either.    Still deciding how to get back to Edinburgh we will have 3 nights remaining.    Thanks and cheers! ,Bedwards_4488,Scotland,
I’m picking up my friend at EDI and need to park. Her arrival is likely to be delayed and she has a lot of luggage so I want to actually wait inside for her - no curb-side pickup. Looks like the multi-story lot is the best option. I tried to pre-book but it looks like you can’t pre-book for less than a day - is that true? The three hour rate is ok at £20 for 3 hours compared to £39.99 pre-booked.    I do note that the pre-booked rate says refundable but that may just mean if you don’t use it at all.    So I’m assuming I need to go without a booking if I want the three hour rate? ,Chris S,Edinburgh,San Francisco...

We (two adults) will be visiting London/Paris in this coming December. Can you please kindly take a look at our (London) itierary and make suggestions for necessary changes? Many thanks in advance!    Day 1 Thu: Arrive at 620am. AM: British Museum; PM: Covent Garden & Soho; afternoon tea (recommendations?); Evening: Christmas Market.    Day 2 (Fri): St Paul's; PM: London Bridge; bankside walk; Shakespeare tour; Jubilee Walkway. Evening: Theater or Tate Modern.    Day 3 (Sat): Tower of London (prebook tickets); Cruise to Westminster. PM: Westminster Abbey. House of Parliament tour. Westminster Evensong.    Day 4 (Sun): Churchill war room (prebook tickets 9:30am); changing of Guards (not a must-see if no time); St James's park; National Gallery; Theater show?    Day 5 (Mon): Harry Potter day (Tour booked for 11:00am).    Day 6 (Tue): Greenwich (Cutty Suck/National Maritime Museum/Queen's House/Royal Observatory). Late night train to Paris.    Questions:  1. I feel day 3 is too tight since Tower of London will take at least 3 hours so I think I should do Tower of London on day 2 and St Paul’s Cathedral day 3 but this swap means day 2 will become our “church” day.  2. Any room to squeeze in anything else (e.g. Hyde Park Winterland Skygarden etc.)? ,Jane,London,
Hello    We are arriving in Heathrow early afternoon on Christmas Eve and heading to our hotel Montague on the Gardens. The hotel has given us a couple of options for transportation. Heathrow Express which as I am reading this forum advises against is not running anyways starting on 12/24 is out. The tube option either via Piccadilly with the stop to Russell Square sounds the most straight forward and economical option but the stairs sounds difficult to navigate with luggage. I also wonder how crowded the tube will be during Christmas Eve afternoon.    So now I am thinking of either black cab directly queuing after getting out of customs as that would be the fastest but how will traffic be Christmas Eve and are there any surcharge? Would we be better off pre-booking a car service?    Thank you all in advance for your advice! ,midorigal,London,Los Angeles...

We are 4 adults late 60's and will be visiting Scotland flying into Edinburgh from Ireland. One of our group really wants to see Hadrian's Wall. I am not sure how to add it into our Scotland trip (itinerary TBD). We are not hikers and only gentle walkers. Can we do this in one day (RT)? I know it will be a very long car day. I am thinking of telling our friend that maybe this is an outing best done if she ever gets to England (who knows if she ever will though). What are your opinions on this?    I am trying to put together an 8-10 night itinerary for us in Scotland and this was her request to add. I am assuming that we fly into Edinburgh and stay 2 nights. Spend our full day (day after arrival) making the trek to HW. Thoughts? ,Sparks,England,"Summerville, South..."
My husband and I are coming to Liverpool from Cardiff in February for three nights (staying in a hotel in the Albert Dock) and want to make the most of our time.

Also any recommendations for places to eat including somewhere nice for the birthday meal. Thanks in advance. ,Bethan J,Liverpool,

We had planned to visit the Sky Garden on a free ticket but foolishly I have left it too late. It's even too late for a booking in one of the bars.    We are only on a short visit and would like to take in a rooftop bar for a drink or two and maybe some nibbles probably not a meal. It doesn't have to be an evening we'll be in and around the West End so if it's a lunchtime or afternoon visit then that's fine.    I'm interested in people's recommendations. I've seen mention of the Duck and Waffle OXO Tower and Londoner. All look interesting but not sure what would fit best. ,iainjo68,London,"Sheffield, United..."

Continuing on with my UK December trip planning trying to price up a good rental car for our family of four (and 4 reasonable sized suitcases as we'll be travelling for over a month) for a period of approximately 23 days. Thinking we would need a Standard size vehicle.    I have gone through the main providers I can think of Europcar (seems crazily expensive - about GBP2833?!) Sixt (also around the GBP2700 mark) Alamo and National (circa GBP1350)  and Enterprise / Avis / Budget (circa GBP850-1100).    With all that background out the way just wanting to check:  a) if there's any other provider that is worth checking out  b) whether the prices of the cheaper providers seems reasonable (cheaper ones pretty reasonable on the surface but just want to confirm)  c) also wondering if anyone has ever driven a Hyundai Tuscon or Vauxhall Insignia and if you can tell me whether 4 suitcases would fit in the boot (as the guides they give you on the rental sites never give you much of a clue when it comes to reality...)

Thanks for your input on my previous question! I do need a bit more assistance on planning our Heathrow to Bath to Salisbury to London trip.    We will stay overnight near Heathrow on Friday night since some of our group land later in the evening 5/19. One thought is to hire a driver for early morning 5/20 to bring us to Bath. We are staying at Arlington House on Bath St. We want to rent a car in Bath on Saturday so that we can drive to Salisbury on Sunday. We are staying at Sarum College in Salisbury 5/21 and 5/22 and have tickets for early admission to Stonehenge on 5/22. We hope to drive around the rest of that day maybe go to Avesbury and....? (suggestions welcome)    It doesn't look like we can rent a car on Sunday hence we are considering renting on Saturday and pay to park in Bath Saturday night. Would it be smarter to rent a car and drive from Heathrow or to get a driver and rent in Bath? (Our travel companion is driving. He is flexible but I'm thinking driving out of and into Heathrow might be a headache.)    We have reservations in London 5/23 - 5/28. Should we drive a rental back to Heathrow on Tuesday or better to drop off the rental in Southampton and take the train in? I'm thinking train might make more sense on a week day. ,BlueMoon1990,Bath,Old Mystic...

Hello I'm new to the forum obviously but thank you -- this is great!    I'll be going to London in a couple months arriving at LHR and then going to our hotel in the Westminster area (DoubleTree Victoria). Does anyone know if the taxi's at LHR charge by Zone (meaning there's one price for all hotels in Westminster another price for South Bank etc..) or do they just charge whatever their taxi meter says?    Another transport question. Does anyone have experience with the Uber estimator and how accurate it is? I just checked and according to uber.com it will cost about 51 pounds to go from our hotel to the London Cruise Terminal in Tilbury -- that seems too good to be true considering some of the shuttles charge twice as much. Any thoughts on that?    Thank you for your time  regards! ,Greg A,London,San Jose

Hello  A couple of days ago I made a reservation for the Blackfriars hotel.

Hi I am visiting with my wife and 3 kids (1510.6) between xmas and new year    Ive always had a fascination with Battersea Power Station and would like to spend some time around it.

Is there much to occupy us at Battersea Power Station? will it be decorated for xmas or will there be any xmas markets in the vicinity?

In the last ten years we have been on at least a dozen walking-hiking tours in Europe and the USA. Our experience with Orbis Ways on the Fife Coastal Trail was by far the worst by a very very long stretch. Except for the accommodations—which we learned were done through a popular hotel booking service that any one has access to—the tour service was unprofessional and substandard. The tour cost £1040 or $1335. By my calculations we could have done it all (hotels and taxi) for half that. What did we get for a £500/$650 worth of overhead? Almost nothing. It is clear Orbis subcontracted much of the tour out. I received an email (long after it was relevant) from an entity called Santiago Ways. I never spoke to the designated representative in Barcelona (Carmen) but to a person in a call center 1000—or judging by the accent 5000¬¬¬¬–miles away from Barcelona. It is pretty clear that neither Orbis Way’s nor the subcontractors’ staff have walked the Fife Coast Trail or done what I would consider basic due diligence. The so-called information packet had sections on the Fife Coast virtually identical to a booklet we found in a hotel. The packet’s suggested baggage was not only unhelpful it was risky—walking the Fife Trail in sandals when boots (and sticks) are essential? Carrying a Social Security card and a swimsuit but nothing to block brambles? The so-called maps were worse than useless. The “Walking Holidays” schedule provided a very abbreviated and unhelpful overview. It was sent as a pdf document making it difficult to access on a phone. The directions were limited to a somewhat improved Google map guide: walk so many kilometers take a particular street walk through a town. The maps often failed to download even when we were in a town with 5G. The directions failed to state that the signs for either the Fife Coast Trail or streets are often not present or that the Trail has several branches without signage or that in many places the Trail is overgrown with brambles or that the last part of the Trail to Elie is steep and rather dangerous. The map provided no information on possible short cuts (such as walking on the beach rather than through rough terrain) or bus routes to take if someone gets hurt or tired. What Orbis Ways provides once we were are on the Trail were not physical maps but virtual ones and thus dependent on the user having near-perfect wifi connections. I had two I-phones with different servers—and neither one picked up the Orbis-provided maps once we were on the Trail. Fortunately I has the Ordnance Survey app whose maps proved to be literally a lifesaver. Our second major complaint was that level of service Orbis Ways provided for that $600 overhead. When we arrived at the first hotel we found that the promised baggage tags were not present and the hotel had no information (and no contact number) to provide them. I spent the better part of an hour juggling between a UK phone and another phone with Skype to straighten things out. Throughout this the supposed Orbis representative was about as unhelpful as possible. I had a very frustrating discussion with the Orbis call center rep who insisted the maps did work when I was trying to load one the entire conversation. That same representative could not do anything about fixing the luggage pickup problem and told me I needed to call the local representative. The number he provided for the so-called local representative had a Swiss area code that did not work. We got an email after much delay the next day from someone (also in Barcelona) from Santiago Ways who was no more helpful. We never knew if this was supposed to be the local representative or not. You could say within the first hour of my experience with Orbis Ways I had lost all trust in their competence. I spent what was supposed to be a relaxing holiday doing all the research for the Trail that I thought I had paid Orbis to do. I could go on at length but you get the idea. I will say that on Trail we talked to other walkers who had gone with other companies (Mac’s seemed the most popular) who had paid much less and received much better service. When I expressed my displeasure in an email Carmen promised to call me. Of course she did not. As far as I am concerned Orbis Ways provided deceptive and in some cases dangerous information failed to provide basic and essential support was condescending and dismissive of my complaints and grossly overcharged me. ,Brian L,Fife,"Amsterdam, The..."

Hi everyone    As a tradition I take my family of 6 (all adults) to a UK destination just before Christmas. This year we will hop on the P&O from Rotterdam to Hull and onwards to York.

Hello!  We're a family of five (three kids 8 & 11 yrs) and we're staying in Brighton from 23 - 31 December. We plan to make an overnight trip into London on Wednesday 27 Dec and will stay in Hyde Park. This is the plan so far:    Wed 27 10am-ish Arrive in London Victoria Station  Take Circle Line (?) up to the Natural History Museum for ± 2-3 hours  Lunch  London bus to see some sights (Route suggestions welcome!)  Visit to Hamleys  Head on to Leicester Square Lego Store  Early dinner  Take in the Christmas lights  London Bus back to Hyde Park hotel    Thurs 28 8-9am Take Circle to Westminster  Take Uber boat (?) to Tower Millenium Pier  Visit Tower of London (still need to buy tickets for this...need to look into the 241 offer)  Head across Tower Bridge towards Borough Market  Head to London Bridge Station to take train back to Brighton late afternoon.    We'll then be coming back into London on Saturday 30 Dec for the 2.30pm show of Wicked.  We'll have the evening in Covent Garden or similar and then take the train to Watford to overnight and go to Harry Potter on Sunday 31 Dec 09h30. We will then head back to Brighton for New Year's Eve.    If we came into London early on the Saturday we could possibly fit in the British Museum before going to watch Wicked.    This is our kids first trip to London or any big city so I expect it'll be quite overwhelming which is why I don't want to overcram the itinerary. I want us to have time to stop for hot chocolate and look in random shops on our way to things without feeling too rushed!    I think this itinerary will give us a nice balance of history sights fun etc but would really appreciate any insights or recommendations that you experts might have! ,ScottHick,London,"Johannesburg, South..."
I’ll be traveling to London in May with my husband and our adult son and was looking for something fairly centrally located that wasn’t too cramped for 5 nights. I haven’t been to London in years and was pretty shocked at how much the hotel prices have gone up…the 2 hotels I would usually stay at are going for £730 a night which is unreasonable IMHO. Looking at other options I came across this Marriott located in Kensington for around £550 a night that appears to be in an okay area close to a tube station but would love some feedback.    https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lonrk-residence-inn-london-kensington/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0 ,shellbell757,London,Virginia Beach...
Hello!    We are traveling to London for the first time next June - two adults and a 7 year old child. We are looking for a hotel room that is >300 sqft and has 2 real beds or one bed and a separate sofa bed for our child.    We want to stay in a walkable neighborhood in Central London that is near the tube so we can easily get to all the usual tourist sites. Safety is a priority and having fun restaurant and cafe options walkable would be great. We would like to stay in a hotel rather than an Airbnb or serviced apartment.    We are trying to keep it under $500/night if possible. Here are the options I've found so far that could work but I know nothing about London or what certain neighborhoods are like so any feedback is much appreciated! We have found deals for all of these hotels that fit in our budget.    Leonardo Royal Hotel London City  Sea Containers  Park Plaza County Hall  Pan Pacific London  Hotel Indigo Kensington  Tower Suites by Blue Orchid  Apex City of London    Thank you! ,Elizabeth C,London,Los Angeles

Plan to do a Paris daytrip Tuesday 2 April.    Will be starting from an Airbnb near Hampstead Heath Extension.    Want to take the 06:01 Eurostar and reckon I should be at STP by 05:00.    Am I correct to assume that public transportation won't be available that early so reserving a car service via Freenow or Uber will be recommended? ,Dusibello,London,South Carolina
First thanks for everyone's help so far with my questions. I will have four nights with my family to spend in the Highlands after two nights in Edinburgh. We will need to spend at least the last night in Inverness to catch a flight to London. We are very open to suggestions on places to visit but one must in a visit to the Strathnaver Museum in Bettyhill in the far north.    I am trying to figure out the best way to go about this. Should we just base ourselves in Inverness for the 4 nights and do day trips from there? Bettyhill is about a 2.5 hour drive from Inverness so its a doable day trip but definitely a long day. Should we spend a couple of nights in the far north near the museum and then a couple of nights in Inverness?    This is my families first trip to Scotland so this is all new for us. My parents are also older so hiking and those types of things are not realistic. We would be looking for towns where we can enjoy the scenery/small town vibes with realistic walking each day for folks in their late 70s. I would prefer to be in a town with places to eat pubs etc. rather than in the countryside somewhere away from everything.    Thanks! ,IrishTexasAggie,Scotland,"Bogota, Colombia"
Any recommendations for restaurants to visit in London - we are two adults plus a 15-month old (will need a high chair). Not as concerned about the menu for the toddler just that the restaurant is kid-friendly :)! We have never been to London before and are staying in Chelsea (Sloane Square).

Does this seem like too much? My mother and I are taking an early train from Liverpool to Llandudno arriving at 8:am. We then hope to take a tour through Snowdonia and Portmeirion (and Conwy Castle if possible) arriving back to Llandudno to then catch an evening train to Holyhead as we leave the following day for Dublin by ferry. Is this all possible or are the time constraints going to be too bad? Also the tours we're looking at say no bags allowed but we'll have our backpacks. Is there an area for storage anywhere close to the station?? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ,Karyn75,Llandudno,"Lafayette, Louisiana"
Hello    I was looking through vacation rentals in London and foolishly booked a rental through Plum Guide without checking reviews first. It looks like a site that is copying the airbnb model - yes  with all the requisite buzzwords. I didn't necessarily buy their claim that they combed through all the listings to find the best  ones but the picture of the property looks very nice and is more reasonable than some.  Now of course I'm concerned about whether the property is as represented and whether or not the host will be reliable. I would lose much of the deposit if I cancel. Any suggestions? ,Lynn B,London,Belmont...
Is this still a thing in London pubs or restaurants? I know times are changing but it would be nice to know that along with fish & chips etc the ploughman's lunch or platter is still something you can get pretty easily.    Any recommendations for a good one with a good range of items not just some ham and cheese and bread. Good bread and good pate or chutney and maybe some pork pie would be a bonus.    And what's good to drink with a ploughman's? I'm generally a wine drinker but a good beer that goes well with it I'd consider it. Or what about cider?    Thanks. ,Aynat62,London,Greater Sydney...

Evening All    Hoping you could help me. We are coming up for a 4 day trip in December. Staying in Central Edinburgh as it’s my first trip to Scotland I would really love to see the “Highland Coos” my granny spoke so fondly of. Is there anywhere you could recommend to see them in December within an hours drive of Edinburgh?    Many thanks L x ,LibbyW78,Edinburgh,United Kingdom

Hello locals and recent visitors. We’re planning a trip to the Orkneys for early June next year. Been reading about large numbers of cruise ship passengers having a negative impact on experiencing Orkney. We visited Skye a few years ago and found the sheer numbers of large groups of people at the well known sites somewhat ruined the experience. Away from the “big” sites it was great. Also visited Lewis and Harris and found them to be blissfully calm and relaxed. So my question is how accurate are the reports of over tourism and does the same thing hold true for Shetland? We’re an active retired couple who enjoys walking history nature local sites pubs and coffee. Thanks for your thoughts and opinions ,Dorothy,Orkney Islands,"Victoria, B.C."
I'll be spending time with my family in London this month and would be grateful for your recommendations. I've read many varied posts on this topic and my apologies if redundant.    We'll depart London on a Tuesday for Bibury and then fly out of Heathrow at 1pm on a Friday. What is the most efficient way to get a rental car and then get to Heathrow?  1. From London to Bibury (Tuesday) - Based on what I've read it sounds like it would be best to take a train from London to either Oxford or Bath and to get a car rental.  2. From Bibury to Heathrow (Friday) - I worry that driving to Heathrow may be too chaotic and am considering the National Express from Bath.    I'll be with small kids and my biggest concern is efficiency for getting to Heathrow.    Thank you! ,Ollie K,Cotswolds,Hartford...
Hi there! We're a family of five (two adults/3 kids 8-11yrs) staying in Brighton from 24 December to 1 January and planning two overnight trips into London on 27 December and 30 December. My question is do I need to buy train tickets in advance ie will the trains be full that we can't buy tickets on the day? We'd be travelling from Brighton to London Victoria/London Bridge.  I understand that we could get cheaper tickets buying ahead of time but want to know if that's absolutely necessary. I'm also looking at buying a digital Family Railcard once we arrive.  Thanks so much! ,ScottHick,London,"Johannesburg, South..."
Hi we are looking to visit London this Friday/Saturday so staying for one night only. Can anyone recommend budget accommodation for 3 adults with parking to the West of London as we are coming from Cardiff. Unfortunately one hotel room is not an option. Appreciate that it could take up to 30 mins by train to get to Central London but that's fine. Any suggestion for areas to look for accommodation would be appreciated. Many thanks ,cheriton53,London,UK
Hi folks I and my partner were planning on walking the Dales Way or a portion of it in late spring. I'm curious how advisable/doable it is to walk it in reverse; I ask because we're planning to go to York for a few days after and it seems much easier to get from Ilkley to York than to get from Bowness or anywhere else at the other end to York or anywhere. As we'd like to keep the longer travel pre-walk the southeast directions would seem to make more sense.    I've seen a guidebook that had details of how to take the reverse route so evidently it's not unheard of but I'm curious if anyone has any insight into how much more difficult it is. Would the constant map reading be enough to detract from the experience? ,Froggus,Yorkshire,
Americans who will be visiting Oxford in early December.  Are people masking indoors? for the theater for instance?  Will any businesses require it or suggest it?  Or check vaccination cards?

Hello everyone    Me and my wife we are going to take our 9-month old baby to London in the first weekend of December. We are going to stay for 3 days.    We are going to stay at a hotel near the Aldgate East station.    We are a bit concerned about the food. He started eating solids about 2 months ago he eats soup cooked vegetables and pasta fruit yogurt and of course his milk. Can you tell me some options of nearby baby-friendly places to eat? places that cook food in a very simple way without salt spices etc...?    On the other hand if the weather is miserable (we hope not!) can you tell me of options to see/do indoors? We wanted to see some Christmas markets and some of the main attractions (which are many...!!!) but if you could recommend the ones more suitable to go with a baby I would appreciate it. Of course having baby facilities is a plus!    Thank you all in advance! ,Daniel,London,"Porto, Portugal"

Hi there    I am hoping you can help. Every year we bring our boys to London for a night just before Christmas. They love this tradition and really look forward to it. Last year we couldn’t make it as I fell down the stairs severely damaging my ankle so we want to make this year special.    They are now 14 & 17 & love good food in nice restaurants. I wonder if you could recommend a restaurant that is fun or interesting for teens that has great food on a Sunday night: if it’s Christmassy too that’s even better.    We normally do a show but not doing that this year so anything else you think we should do would be amazing.    Thanks so much in advance ,LadyMogwai,London,"Bath, United Kingdom"

Hello and thanks in advance for any and all help.    Im bringing two kids to for a few nights in London staying near St Pancreas station.    From what I can tell price and availability wise there's no point buying rail tickets in advance and I may as well purchase on line when actually at the station?    Our flight home departs gatwick at 8pm and we have tickets for Millwall vs Southampton kick off at 3pm. Is this doable? We wont have checked in bags. Theres a 17.08 train and a 15.53 train with the journey taking about an hour.    Does it take long to get from the Gatwick train station to the flight departures?  Is the change at London bridge fairly straight forward?  If we leave bags at London bridge can they be collected while changing?  After a match how hard is it to get on the train? Every train ticket I see from South Bermondsey seems to be an anytime ticket even first class so it doesn't seem possible to have a seat reserved after the game?    Given South Bermondsey is the closest rail station to the Den and is in the same zone as Pancreas can a return journey back start from there or is there even any benefit to a return ticket?    From the Den I presume it is best to go South Bermondsey to London Bridge and from there to Gatwick or is there an alternative I havent seen?    Finally I cant find stadium rules online. Are we able to bring small bags into the stadium. My wife isnt going to the game and instead will do some shopping but I guess I can always let her bring all the bags if it comes down to it...... ,balmed_0ut,London,"Clonakilty, Ireland"

My husband and I plan to meet in England the week of June 14 2024 after I finish a walking holiday in the Peak District. We won't have a car. I'm hoping to get advice on where we could base ourselves for a week. We love the countryside walking small villages churches castles...and smaller cities or towns. In particular we would like to be near a canal with towpaths to walk along. Last year for example we spent a week in Bath and one of my favorite days was walking from Bradford on Avon back to Bath stopping at a pub for dinner on the way.    Thanks for any suggestions!

am going to be in England from May 28th through June 7th. I get in at night on the 28th and hope to visit a friend for two to three nights in Waddington and after go on a self guided walk (moderate as I will have just done 3 weeks of trekking in Greece). I plan on starting a walk on May 30th or 31st for anywhere from 4 nights to 6 nights ( 5 or 6 days max 7 days) and then go back to London for two or three nights. Places I have looked at are South West Coast Path Cotswold and Northumberland Coast Path. I want a trail that is not to hard to get to using public transportation. For the South West Coast I have found a trip through Hillwalk Tours and Celtic Trails which seem to be good companies and Northumberland through Celtic Trails. I can't do a guided tour as the dates I will have available are set so looking for referrals to companies that have self guided tours that are easy enough to follow on my own (I am a hiker and use Gaia on trails all the time). I am a senior. Looking for anyone that might recommend other companies or areas I might consider traveling to or that know about these two companies. Thank you in advance ,Monioz,,"Eugene, Oregon"

Greetings Rail Wizards!  I will be traveling to the UK next spring and would like to get a handle on transpo options.  I'll be arriving via LHR and heading straight to Norwich for the weekend then returning to London for a few days for sightseeing etc.  So I'm trying to navigate both the national rail system options and the inner city options. Also an outside chance of taking a day trip to Stonehenge maybe?  I'm assuming one rail pass won't cover everything but it still seems kind of complicated. Specifically looking for a discount rail pass to get me to/from LHR and to/from Norwich. Then something for the city that covers the Tube and buses.  Thanks in advance for your insight!  - chris ,chris g,London,St. Petersburg

Hey there- we will be returning from a few day stay in Manchester to London on the last full day/ last night of our week long trip. I *think* we will arrive from Manchester at the Euston train station if I am reading things correctly. We have a 9:00 am flight out the next day. Would you stay at a hotel near the airport (the ones in the airport are booked or too pricey for us) or just stay in London and take a cab to the airport and leave at 5:00/5:30 am ish? We are a family of four not budget travelers but also don't want to spend $500 on a hotel in airport. If London any suggestions where to stay in walking distance of that train station? ,Goromgirl,England,
Hello London Experts: We have an overnight layover coming up mid-December and I would appreciate help deciding where to spend the night. Our flight gets into LHR at 10pm on a Monday night and departs the following morning for the USA at 11am.    We would like to get into London to see Christmas lights and a have very late dinner. Options:  1) We could stay at a hotel near Heathrow - the problem with that is getting back to the hotel from central London by train since they don't run very late at night. We could spend for an Uber ride.  2) Stay along the Piccadilly (Hammersmith or Earl's Court) or Elizabeth line closer to London. Would mean we'll need to leave for Heathrow rather early in the morning.    A third option is to find a hotel/pub near Heathrow that has a festive atmosphere where we don't need to go into London - I could use some help figuring something like that out. Would Richmond or Windsor work? If Windsor would it be best to take an Uber/taxi?    If we were only getting in a couple of hours earlier this would not be so difficult but this is what we have. Suggestions are appreciated! ,sea-lon-sf,London,San Francisco...
Hi all! I want to plan a trip for my mom in the UK. She is a big fan of british crime series and always said that she would love to visit these cute little villages shown in the series. My plan would be to fly to somewhere in the UK and then travel by train for maximum a week (renting a car would also be an option if needed). Do you have any recommendations of a realistic route? Of course I am not expecting the exact villages of where the series were filmed but just little places with a similar vibe. We are also sporty so a bike ride or a hike here and there would be more than welcome. Thanks a lot in advance!! :) ,Zora V,,"Vienna, Austria"
By Best I mean largest (most stalls) good lighting display good food (relative to other Christmas markets)  I'll be flying into London (but can immediately connect elsewhere). Eventually I'll fly to Frankfurt from London and go home from there. I've been to many German Christmas Markets. I'd like to see what UK has to offer. Preferably somewhere easily accessible by public transport.  I was thinking Edinburgh then Manchester then down to London. Not sure. I'd appreciate any suggestions. ,eng333,,New Jersey

In looking at vacation rentals as well as hotels how rigid should one be in regard to the actual neighborhood name? For example we are looking for a week stay and began by narrowing it down on a map of Mayfair. However some places that are coming up in our search are then listed as Covent Garden Soho......  Where we are from  neighborhood names do seem to have some overlap and the bleeding into each other is really not that big of a deal. However as we are unfamiliar with London I wanted to ask on this forum.  Thanks! ,dselmal,London,"Chicago, Illinois"

Flying into Manchester from US arriving on Friday morning and leaving on Sunday for London. Main reason for stay is the Man City/Liverpool game on March 9th for my husband and sons (he is in charge of those tickets). My question is:  -where to stay with family of 6? 2 adults 4 kids. I looked at Shankley because I love that we could all stay in one room but it doesn’t look family friendly. I don’t want a big party hotel especially that big football weekend. Any other recs that is not air bnb?  -was hoping to go to Beatles story and see some other sights but also know it will be crowded weekend and we will have jet lag. Please give me any thoughts/suggestions! Kids are 6-13 (3 boys 1 girl). We did Italy with them last year and they travel well!

I am in the very initial stages of making an itinerary for our trip to Scotland in late April/ 1st week May 2024. In reading one of the links provided it said that March-April-Colours of the hills tend to be ‘dun- coloured’ after winter.    Will we not have the amazing GREEN views all over??? This might actually makes us change our dates if we wont see the idyllic green hills etc. We don't like travelling in peak season so I do not want the summer months. ,Sparks,Scotland,"Summerville, South..."
Thank you in advance for reading my plan! I welcome your feedback and suggestions. I'm a 51 YO Mom who will be traveling with my 16 YO son who is fascinated with music public transportation and history. We will also be joined by my 81 YO mother who is relatively fit and active. She's a walker. Trying to balance out 5 days of first timer attractions Christmas markets and museums. We are traveling from California.    Sat. Nov. 18 - arrive LHR around 2pm. Take public transportation to our Air BnB in Knightsbridge. Spend the remainder of day/evening exploring the neighborhood visit Harrods and stop by a market to get some essentials.    Sunday Nov. 19 - 10am walking tour of Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace We would also like to visit the London Transport Museum . Along the way we would like to see Trafalgar Square Leicester Square (check out the Christmas market) and Neal's Yard. We have 4:15 reservations at Hawksmoor Seven Dials for Sunday Roast. With whatever energy we have left we'd like to check out the lights on Carnaby Street and maybe pay a visit to Liberty London (my request)    Monday Nov. 20 - 9:30am visit to Westminster Abbey. Afterward we plan to explore Westminster and work our way toward Churchill War Rooms. We have 3:30 reservations at the Woelsely for Afternoon Tea.    Tuesday Nov. 21 - 10am food tour of Borough Market (3 hours)...still trying to decide what to do with our day after this. Seems convenient to vist the Tower of London on this day but I'd prefer to go first thing in the morning so maybe we will venture over to the Globe Theatre. Afterward we could cross the Millennium Bridge and have a look at St. Paul's.    Wed. Nov. 22 - Tower of London first thing in the morning. I'm predicting we'll spend a couple of hours here. Then considering catching a trip up the Thames to spend the afternoon-evening in Greenwich. - Royal Observatory or Maritime Museum food shops etc.    Thursday. Nov. 23 - 90 Minutes Around the World tour at the British Museum - then off to visit another neighborhood...I'm quite open to suggestions here.    Friday. Nov. 24th depart home.    HERE IS WHERE I NEED HELP  I would like to visit the V&A and my son would like to experience the London Eye (ugh)...where would you fit in these excursions? Being that he is a teenager and will probably not want to be tied down to the Air bnb every night we are there...any evening activity recommendations (appropriate for teenagers of course) would be welcomed as well! ,delsie4130,London,
Hi  We'll (my husband and I) be in Stirling next June. We'll be arriving EDI from LHR at 13:10 and renting from Arnold Clark at the airport. Our plan is to hopefully tour Hopetoun House and maybe stop by Midhope before heading to Stirling for dinner and a 1 night stay at The Allen Park. Ok so the main question is if we plan to drive to Balmaha for a 2 night stay the following afternoon how can we best utilize our short time in Stirling?    Here's my thought:    Around 8:30: King's View Queen's View for photos and on to Ballengeich Cemetery (Can we walk around early in the morning or will the gate be locked?) I was hoping to take some scenic pictures early in the day. Unfortunately I can't get up at the crack of dawn in June in Scotland! But where would you walk for some interesting photos before the castle opens?  9:30: Stirling Castle Argyil's Lodging and the garden. Tickets bought in advance. (It's my understanding that we should give this experience 2 hours. Is that correct?)  Lunch? I'm reading The Portcullis is good. Any place else you'd recommend?  Stop in to Made in Stirling after lunch (I'm looking for local art particularly etchings drawings and watercolors while in Scotland. They don't have to be Scottish land and cityscapes.) If we have time we'll go to a couple more local shops. Which do you recommend? We aren't lining our suitcases with souvenirs. We do need to pick up some midge spray before heading west to hike. Is there a convenient shop we can stop in on our way out of town?  After getting our car depending upon the time we'd drive to the Wallace Monument via the Old Stirling Bridge before leaving for Balmaha. We'd like to get there between 3pm and 4pm. We plan on short hill walks and cruises on and around Loch Lomond while we are there.    Would you skip any of these things in Stirling for the sake of something else in the area? I mean there's so much to do. We could be easily entertained by Dunblane Cathedral or Doune Castle (exterior) or wandering over to Bracklinn Falls near Callandar before heading to Balmaha. Decisions decisions! And of course if it's pouring rain at Loch Lomond we'll have more time for exploring towns but we are hoping for sunshine in June. Thanks for your input. ,Connie E,Stirling,

Just booked a few nights near Kinlochard between Christmas and New Year family with pre-teen and a dog it will be our 1st time in Scotland. Any tips to help me build an itinerary to make the most out of our three days there please? I’m fully aware it will be cold potentially wet and the days are very short. We’re very easy going happy to drive further out or walk reasonable distances just want to enjoy the scenery really if weather allows or play board games if not.

Someone just told me when they were in London last year with another couple all the restaurants would only give 1 bill and they would have to settle up with each other is this common? I'm travelling next month with 3 friends and think it could become an hassle to constantly be settling up who owes what instead of the restaurant just giving separate bills (as long as you alert the server at the start of ordering) for us to each just pay our own bill. ,eyeguysgirl,London,Canada

Not a question but pointing something out for those who aren't aware. I've visited London many times and always love it. On our recent visit at the beginning of this month we went to a nice restaurant in Marylebone and enjoyed our evening. The bill came at the end of the evening and it was incorrect we'd be given someone else's bill so I was glad I checked. This was pointed out and corrected so no issue. What I then noticed on the bill was that we'd been charged 29 pounds 'optional service charge'. Being with friends and not wanting it to be awkward I didn't question it however was not happy at having to effectively give a tip of $55 AUD for service that I found a bit obtrusive and annoying. On doing some research on the return home it seems that it is optional and you can ask for it to be removed. When I looked at the receipt for the pre-dinner drink at a bar we'd also been charged the optional service charge. Something to be aware of. ,Edwina,London,"Melbourne, Australia"

Here's a slightly different question. Maybe someone has the answer. I'm trying to recreate from memory a summer trip I took to Great Britain over a 4 week period when I was 21 years old. I am almost certain we ( my best friend my sister and I) took an overnight ferry directly from Glasgow to Belfast. My recollection was that it took about 10 hours. It seems that most of the ferries now go from Cairnryan to Belfast in much less time. The year was 1971 and after landing in Belfast we unloaded our bicycles and rode through Belfast past the checkpoints manned by British soldiers during the Troubles. I don't think my Irish American parents knew what we were getting into despite their heritage! Thank you and I hope I'm not too far off topic. ,Rich G,Glasgow,
Good afternoon and thanks in advance for any responses. I will be in London for one night on 4th January and see that the Travelodge chain have lots of good deals.

Thanks very much in advance. ,dave,London,Spain
Hi  I'll be in Glasgow for 5 days the second week of November. I will have a car and would like to do a day trip out of the city on one of those days. I've driven a lot in Scotland on previous trips and like the freedom of being able to stop when I want so I'm not interested in tour company.  I have had a look at Loch Lomond and the Trossach's NP are but can't decide if I should continue west to Oban and do a loop on the A816 and A83 or head further north to Glencoe then take the A86 to the south end of the Cairngorms NP and then head back to Glasgow along Loch Tay and past Stirling.  I'm looking for great views & scenery for landscape photography villages to explore and a distillery or two to visit. I won't be sampling at the distillery I'm looking for gifts to bring back to Canada.    Any recommendations would be really appreciated.    Thanks ,Wanderer7676,Glasgow,"Edmonton, Canada"

Hi Everyone    We are a family of 4 (2 adults and two nine-year-old kids) traveling to London in mid-November. Our hotel is the Premier Inn County Hall and we will have two full days in London. My husband and I have been to London before but this will be our kids' first London tour.    The attractions we want to visit are: Buckingham Palace (changing of the guards) Westminster Abbey the London Eye London Bridge/Tower St. Paul's Cathedral (optional) Churchill War Rooms on the first day. On the second day we plan to visit the British Museum and Windsor Castle. The London Pass doesn't include the London Eye but it includes most of the places we want to visit as well as a ticket for the Hop-on Hop-off bus. It will cost us 356 pounds for all four of us. My brain is overloaded with all the information and options and I'm having a hard time deciding whether I should purchase the 2-day London Pass or go for the 2-for-1 deal.    What is the best option for us purchasing the London Pass or buying the 2-for-1 deal for each attraction? Please also provide me with your insights on our itinerary whether it is too crowded and the order of things to do. Many thanks. ,Tanya,London,Washington DC...
We are a family of four and will be staying at LHR on a Monday night.    Which Premier Inn is best for us? We have an early international flight (7am) from T5.

(I assume it doesn't matter but we will be coming to the hotel from central London on Monday evening).    Thank you! ,Wanderer297396,London,

We are a couple planning a short break in the UK next June.  We'd like to do a canal tour which would have a fair amount of historic places to see.  Leeds & Liverpool seems to be interesting with operators in Silsden and Skipton and from what I can see has pubs and castles along the route.  It also may tie up with a steam train excursion if the dates align.  Rather than joining yet another forum can anyone here give me some fast facts on the pro's and con's of doing this canal. The other alternative is the Lancaster Canal but that seems to have less waterside attractions.    FYI we will be coming off a Euro river cruise so I will not need to slow down and relax we will want to stop and explore the villages sights and area's rather than listen to the lapping of water. ,UteBloke,,"Sydney, Australia"

Or should we get an Oyster card for them? I can't seem to find family tickets and we don't need 2-4-1 deals so am not how best to cover this trip.

What's the most scenic route from Bournemouth to Wrexham. Happy to have an overnight stop ,Elizabeth J,Wrexham,
I'm considering both of these as accommodation in April 2024.    One is a pub with rooms (The Orange) and the other is a small hotel (The Lime Tree). Both are around the same price and both are in an area I want to stay for part of my 2 week London stay. I'll be splitting my stay between definitely Belgravia and another area maybe Bloomsbury or somewhere on the east side.    Both have the look and style I like for London sort of quaint and cosy with a modern twist. Reviews can be mixed for The Orange some reviews are very good while others are pretty bad. I'm also a little concerned about noise from the pub reaching the rooms above.    Any opinions one way or the other? Thanks. ,Aynat62,London,Greater Sydney...

Hello I’m looking to book hotel Xanadu for a concert at Wembley next year. I’m wondering once we leave Wembley at 10.30-11 how easy it to get back to Ealing?

But I’m wondering is this reliable and do this stop at a certain time? In case this fails is there somewhere we could safely walk to out of the crowds but in the right direction and catch a taxi then? Any other tips appreciated.

HiI’ll be visiting Scotland for the first time and I’ll be going to see MacBeth play at the Royal Highland CenterLowland Hall.

I was just a bit shocked by the reviews concerning the location of the Highland Centeris it that badly served? Thanks a lot. ,Estera Bretz,Edinburgh,
About 6 or 7 years ago we had a fabulous meal in a Middle Eastern restaurant which was on the upper floor of a terraced house. It was within walking distance of the centre possibly Derby Road way. It was family owned it had an alcohol licence it was very popular and highly recommended at the time. Unfortunately I can’t access my Trip Advisor account I know I left a review for it. Does this sound familiar to anyone? We are coming back next month and definitely want to eat there again if it’s still open. ,Caroline J,Nottingham,

We’ll spend a few days driving in the northern Cotswolds. From there we’ll drop off the rental and take a train either to York or to Edinburgh (still deciding if we want to do a night in a York it’s optional).    Where would you recommend we drop the car and board a train? Ideally it would be a town that has a rental branch close to the train station and a fairly direct train connection to Edinburgh (or York).    We haven’t selected a car rental company yet—I want to decide partly based on which companies will have a convenient drop-off location. We’re picking it up in London.    Open to a stop other than York btw. Our only “must” is to get from the Cotswolds to Edinburgh. We have a flex day we can use for whatever we want. ,mcdisney2001,Cotswolds,"Seattle, Washington"
Hi. I will be passing through London twice in a couple of months. Each time I will be in London for one full day. (This is in the context of layovers between budget flights elsewhere.) I have been to London many times before so I have no need to see the main sights again. My plan is to visit favorite haunts and maybe an interesting temporary exhibit or two.    My question has to do with transport. My many visits to London all happened more than a decade ago. They were longer visits that probably involved weeklong travelcards (or at one point when I actually lived there monthly tickets). I don't understand the current payment arrangements. For my brief visits it probably doesn't make sense investing £7 in an Oyster card (or £14 cost plus postage for the Visitor Oyster Card). On the first of those days I will make 2–3 trips within Zones 1–2 plus 2 additional trips into and out of London by rail. I'm thinking that all of those trips are best paid by contactless credit card individually.    But here I have a question. Looking at the Transport for London website it seems that a separate fare is charged every time there is a transfer between tube and bus. Is that right? If so then it is most cost effective to use a single mode of transport (all bus or all tube) rather than combining them. Is that correct?    On my second nonconsecutive day in London a week or so later I will be based in Zone 3 (for easy airport access the next day and frankly to save money on lodging). I'll probably want to make 4-6 trips that span Zones 1–3. In this case I think that a one-day travelcard might be the best solution. It would also allow trips that combine a tube and a bus leg. Am I wrong about that?    Thanks in advance. ,markoboston,London,Boston...
We're in the UK for a week next summer our first 4 nights in booked in Bloomsbury then we're two nights in Liverpool.

I am writing this experience for the sake of other customers protection and I feel like it is my duty to transfer what we have been through to other customers to be aware and avoid being in similar situations.  Although I do not feel this experience will satisfy the huge disappointment and dissatisfaction this property has caused us turning our vacation into a nightmare we decided to write this out of a very long frustrating experience as a family on a long vacation. I am really sorry that I have not read the reviews on this property (Flex-living) before we booked with them. Also we thought that when we booked with them through booking.com that we would be dealing with a professional company through a professional third party but unfortunately it was the worst experience in my 15 years of travel history.  We booked for 26 nights and paid 7368 £ in advance. We thought we could rest assured that we will receive a professional service from such a company (Flex-Living) however we never thought that this company will turn our holiday vacation into a disaster.  It all started 5 days before our flight when they communicated with us through booking explaining that there was a pipe leak in the apartment we booked (The Pimlico) and that we will be offered an alternative. Because of the short notice and difficulty finding alternative accommodation for a family we asked for pictures of the alternative apartment. They sent us pictures through WhatsApp and claimed that this would be an upgrade. We agreed to the alternative based on the pictures. Unfortunately everything fell apart as soon as we arrived at the alternative apartment (in Primrose Hill). The apartment was nothing like the pictures (dirty place old furniture bad bed springs cracks in the wall and floors). We immediately communicated with them expressing our concerns and dissatisfaction. Unfortunately our concerns were ignored and all we were told was simply It is as advertised.    We communicated repeatedly through booking to have a relocation and checked out half an hour after arrival as we could not stay in such a place. Bookng.com and ourselves tried multiple times on a daily basis throughout our vacation to negotiate with them for a refund to be provided to us as we booked an alternative accommodation at our expense which affected our vacation budget. Unfortunately all responses were that we cannot be refunded simply because they have to pay the landlord. We tried to escalate the issue to the management and we kept being referred to Amanda “a rental supervisor and when we keep expressing our concerns all she said was “If you do not like the beds sleep anywhere”. I do not think anyone would like to pay 7368 £ to have quality time with their family and get such a reply from such a company. No one could imagine that such an amount was paid for checking in for 30 minutes out of 26 days of booking.    This triggered us to run some searches on this property and its strategies which has 131 apartments rented on booking.com:    From our experience we concluded that here are the reasons why we should not have dealt with them and why other customers should be aware of those reasons while dealing with them:    1- The worst customer service as they are not responsive to customer needs nor they care about customer satisfaction.    2- Their business is based on taking apartments from landlords then refurbishing them and renting them to customers while paying a monthly rent to the landlord. So if you rent an apartment even if you do not like it kiss your money goodbye because this is the only way to run the business.    3- As clear from the reviews on booking and Trustpilot they put their clients under pressure to change apartments for many reasons a few days or hours before arrival to occupy vacant apartments. This is never good news for the clients as it could cause major disruption to their vacation plans. Even if the booking was done through a third party like booking.com still there is no guarantee or protection as clear from other customers' reviews.    4- Their vision is to expand the number of apartments available for rental. However quality is the least they care about and it is at the bottom of their list if existent.    5- They are a small company with limited management employees to deal with which leads to dealing with one person only in situations where you need higher management support. We also do not think that higher management has another opinion.    6- A refund is not in their dictionary. So as last advice when you book an apartment with them you will spend a huge amount of money with no guarantee you will get the service you need. So think twice before spending this money on their apartment rental as the outcome will be either being stuck with a low-quality apartment that you have to stay in because you spent the money or refusing to stay and lose all your money. What happened is we ended up losing 7368 Pounds for 30 minutes of check-in knowing that we travel with children.    7- One very important and final point is that they seem to have a high rate and positive reviews across different websites including booking.com.  However after a bit of search I have come to a conclusion that explains their high rate despite their bad services. Apparently all positive reviews on Trustpilot come from landlords and not customers. All negative reviews come from their customers who rent the apartments. Based on this it appears that they do value their landlords more as their business is dependent on their satisfaction to maintain their resources for rent ( apartment)  Looking at customers who book through a third party like Booking.com apparently they maintain their high rate by canceling on customers through booking either to book directly with them or to cancel the reservation which in both situations customers will not be able to give a negative review on Booking.com.  Also I have tried leaving my experience on Trust Pilot many times however it seems that they have a strategy to remove negative reviews posted on them as every time I post my review it keeps being removed although I have communicated with Trustpilot to send evidence of the authenticity of my review but received no response from their end other than removing the reviews. This indicates how some companies are experts at removing negative reviews to maintain their company's image and high rating.    So BEWARE OF THE HIGH RATE AS IN MY EXPERIENCE IT DOES NOT REFLECT THIER TRUE SERVICE. This is also clear from the reviews of some of the customers on Trustpilot who have a similar experience reflecting how they used similar strategies on other customers.    Finally I have written this hoping that our experience and what we have been through will reach other customers for their sake Also I invite every other customer that has any experience with this company to write his experience here whether positive or negative to ground the reality about this company based on its customers' experience not only landlords. ,Aminah A,,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia"

We're staying near the British Museum in April and using public transportation. After touring Windsor Castle and St. George's Cathedral would we have time and/or energy to visit a museum back in London? We were thinking of either the BM since it's near our hotel or Nat Gal (I've been to NatGal and my daughter will just want to visit select exhibits).    Would it be too tight to do one when they close at 5? What about a Friday when they close at 8:30?    Sites say 2-3 hours at Windsor buy I'm not sure how much time afterward to allow for getting back to London or how long St. George's takes for a good look.    Thank you! ,mcdisney2001,,"Seattle, Washington"
Hello all.    I hope you are all well. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my message.    I am travelling down to Hafan Y Moor with my partner and our toddler who is 19 months old.      I have searched the forum and have found multiple of helpful things to do but I am hoping I can get some further suggestions as the posts are a little out dated.    We are up for doing anything and open to all ideas.      We will be travelling via car and up for driving anywhere.    Is there any local towns for shopping or zoos or aquarium’s or anything we can do as a family?. Also any local Christmas markers / activities / festivities.    Thank you so much. ,Corey L,North Wales,

Hello and happy Sunday to all!  Me and my cousin (her first time in London) are taking a trip for her 53th birthday in mid February. Our flights are to and from Heathrow airport.  I booked the above mentioned hotels with free cancellation because of the ongoing Accor sale and the price difference is about 70 British pounds total for 5 nights including breakfast.  We are two women in our 50s and we like to walk I have no plans of where we want to go yet (I’ve been numerous times in London but always stayed with relatives outside the city center). We are mosty interested in exploring nice restaurants and cafes and visiting open markets and of course Tate modern (since she is an artist) and most probably some museums (British and V&A). Also visit St Paul’s cathedral. But the plans are most probably going to change as we approach February.  And of course some nice shopping.  Please help me decide. Thank you in advance! ,MariaLovesToTravel,London,"Athens, Greece"

So I’m meeting a friend the during the day (if that matters). We’re meeting on Park Road outside the Tesco store don’t know if that’s classed as Toxteth or Dingle (they class it as Dingle).    Anyway Dingle never heard much about it. But I’ve always heard bad things about Toxteth it’s basically a no go area if you value your safety. It’s always stories about gangs and the trouble associated with them to druggies and people being mugged. I’m NOT slagging the people off Liverpool Dingle or Toxteth as I’ve heard scousers are supposed to be some of the nicest people around. So is Toxteth as bad as people say it is? If I use my common sense and keep my head down will I run into any trouble? ,ste s,Liverpool,"Wirral, United..."

Hello  I've planned to visit Scotland in November. My day of arrival at Edinburgh airport on Nov 16th and my return from the same airport is on 26. Now I'm planning to stay in Edinburgh for 2 nights or three depending on your advice. Well this will be my first time in Scotland. I've seen some clips and photos of Glencoe FW Oban & Inverness. I kind of liked FW much more than the others and they all seem wonderful though. My plan is to avoid more than three stops by the hotels (so three nights for each hotel or cottage) so I don't pack my bags every time and spend my time in comfort. I don't have any problem with driving there but don't know indeed where to start but presumably driving on North Coast 500 would be so amazing. I'm into mountains lochs views .And I tend to spend a little time in the town after sunset.  My 7 year old daughter along with my wife will be traveling with me.    thanks ,Travhus A,Scotland,

Hi Folks    Bit of a shot in the dark here but do any of you know where I might be able to watch the above match this afternoon from 3pm? I'll be in Oxford Street area and then intend going to residence I'm staying at in Earls Court so whilst the former would be more suitable I could potentially do either location. The match is on Viaplay channel as opposed to Sky Sports etc. Forest vs. Villa is on Sky Sports at the same time.  As I say bit of a stab in the dark.    Thanks. ,Andy_79,London,"Belfast, United..."

This is a two part question and I would greatly appreciate any input/advice from anyone that can help. Thank you!    1) I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who has purchased the Oversea Visitor English Heritage Pass. It looks like it will be a smart purchase. I'm curious if anyone can tell me their experience and if in the end it was a good decision for them. If not why not?    2) I am trying to put together a calendar checklist for any bookings/purchases I can make in advance of our trip in September 2024. I would greatly appreciate any input/suggestions for the things I may be able to take care of prior to our arrival. This is outside of meals. I know this can be subjective so what do you think is worth booking? I may not even realize it is available!    For example:  If I want to try to book Elizabeth Tower - I need to note that tickets are released on the second Wednesday of every month at 10:00 (currently only booking through February 2024).  If I want to book Ceremony of the Keys - tickets are released at 16:00BST on the first day of the month before you want to attend (so booking for December 2023 started on November 1 2023).    Note in case you are not familiar with my situation: arriving at Heathrow on a Tuesday morning spending 13 nights departing from Heathrow. Spending at least 6 nights in London spending 5 in Yorkshire (possibly breaking this into York and one other location) and then 2 nights in either Windsor or Oxford (still finalizing my lodging).    Thank you so much for your time and assistance! ,Sara365_13,England,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
My husband and I will be traveling to Scotland for 2 weeks in May 2024. We will be in Glasgow for 4 nights and then moving to Edinburgh to hop on a 5 day Rabbies tour that will include  Isle of Skye Oban Glencoe Mull Iona and Staffa. The tour drops us off in Edinburgh at 7pm. Our flight leaves from Edinburgh 5 nights later.  We really enjoy exploring smaller towns and considered Pitlochy Perth Dunkeld and possibly St Andrews. I wondered if it would make sense to make a base in Pitlochy and take day trips to Perth and Dunkeld via the rail system. Or does it make sense to stay in Edinburgh and take trains and tours to our desired spots. I noticed that the hotel rates are quite high in Edinburgh but maybe we haven't adapted to inflation yet! Also is there a quaint area of Edinburgh that has bars  cafes and is safe to walk. Thanks in advance. ,Jane J,Scotland,

Hello    I'm landing in Manchester - and it's been extremely difficult to find a car rental open in Llandudno on Sundays for pick up or return.    How difficult is it driving out of Manchester airport ? I'll be landing early morning and wanting to travel to just south of Harlech. Thinking on a Sunday traffic out of the city might be manageable? Any help would be appreciated.    I've heard of car rentals being dropped off at Blaneau Ffestiniog at the train station - but for the life of me cannot find any open on Sundays or which rental company would do that.    thanks for the help! ,Katbaloou,Llandudno,"Trent Hills, Canada"

We are travelling from Paddington to Oxford and back to London on Sat 4 Nov. Already have London - Oxford day return tickets    Want a traditional bonfire night as part of the day which is really for sight-seeing not firework watching but not going back to London to watch something bonfireless it seems better to find somwhere around Oxford/Reading etc.    I see there is Oxford Round Table but it seems to be out of the city centre (South park) which doesn't seem very convenient. This costs £8 with student discount (we are).    Otherwise there is Bicester which seems to be right next to Bicester Village station. This is £5 in advance £6 on the day. So we'd need to get the 18:12 from Oxford station to Bicester Village. The fireworks are very close to the station and the bonfire at 7pm fireworks at 7:30pm. Our tickets are valid via Bicester Village to return to Marylebone so that's fine also.    In Oxford fireworks at 7:15pm and bonfire at 7:35pm.    Any thoughts about these plans? I assume Oxford is bigger would prefer traditional and not something excessively 'health and safety' maybe I have missed some convenient place near Slough or Reading or wahtever. ,DunRomeIn,Oxfordshire,london

Hi  I'm coming up to lovely Whitby for work on Sunday and staying for two days. I was thinking about getting the bus to York on my journey home rather than the train as I'm assuming it goes through some lovely countryside and i won't be in any great rush to get back to the Midlands.  I was wondering about the frequency of these buses? do I have to buy a ticket before I get on or pay the driver on arrival? How much would it cost? Where would i catch it etc? I very much want to see a little of North Yorkshire - I don't mind that it takes 2 hours.  Kind Regards & Thanks ,Dee C,Whitby,"Tamworth, United..."

Hello!    My group are hoping to walk the causeway to the mount on Sunday April 2. Posted times are 9:15-11:45.    In looking over my photos from our June 2018 stroll we just chucked off our footwear and rolled up our jeans to cross wading a large part of it.    I do not recall the water being especially cold but perhaps that will not be the case in April. Should we perhaps have other footwear for the walk?    Also as I did not visit the castle I find myself unable to advise my group about planning to visit . The descriptions of the walk there and the pathways give every indication that it may be too difficult for most of us.

Hi all  We (my wife and 13 year old son) are heading over from Ireland on Thursday morning until Saturday night and we are staying in the Premier Inn Royal Mile.  We have been in Edinburgh twice before but not for many years and that was without our son so I have a couple of quick queries.  1. To get from the airport do we need to book the tram in advance?  2. We have made reservations in a couple of restaurants based on reviews (Shamoli Makars Mash Bar) as well as booking a dungeon tour and the Camera Obscura . We will also visit some Harry Potter landmarks so we have a pretty packed schedule but.......I love Inis and Gunn lager and have been unable to get it anywhere since I was last in Edinburgh. Our activities and meals mean it is very unlikely I will sample any by day. I don't think the Premier Inn serve it and we can't bring our son to a pub after 9 i think? Or if they are serving food maybe we can? We would only be staying till 10 at the latest either way but if anyone can recommend a nice family friendly pub that would be great.

Great Western Railway is advising all customers to complete their journeys by 20.00 as they will not be able to guarantee services after that time.    From 20.00 all trains and rail replacement buses in Cornwall west of St Austell will be suspended until mid-day on Thursday 2nd.    Cross Country Trains will be suspending all services between Exeter and Plymouth/Paignton after 19.30.    Services on Thursday 2nd are likely to be significantly disrupted and poor road conditions may mean alternative transport cannot be provided.    Passengers with tickets to travel this evening may travel earlier if they wish. Passengers with tickets to travel on Thursday 2nd may travel today or may postpone their journey until Friday 3rd. ,wirewiper,England,"Torquay, United..."
thinking of going to see the illuminations not really been through since I was a kid! and am 52 now!    is it one way traffic down the prom or can you go in from any direction?    can any of you recommend a decent sit-in fish and chippie for afterwards? at either end of the illuminations/promenade    thanks ,Nick_Eastwood,Blackpool,"Manchester, United..."
Apparently you can book a time for security though the site isn’t 100 percent clear on what that means or how long it’ll take.    Basically I have a layover of many hours and am planning on going into the city for a while.    Would this make sense? It says I can book a time as late as 90 minutes before departure. If I did that would I be assured of getting through?    If not how early should I get there? I won’t be checking any bags as they should be checked straight through to my final destination.

We will be visiting in June 2024. First day is to visit Stirling Castle. Then onto Loch Lomond - stay Balloch 1 night.  Next day we head to Ft. William for 1 night. On way stop at Luss Village for breakfast short walk and a visit; then head to Tarbet and take boat trip to Inversnaid with walks.  Continue on with options to stop at Glencoe Ski Resort and take chairlift for views/short walk; detour to Glen Etive and take scenic drive; stop in Glencoe before arriving in Ft. William.  Is day 2 doable? How much time should we allow for each activity/drive? What would you leave out if running out of time? Anything we should add instead?  Thanks much! ,LifesABeach60,Scotland,"Tampa, Florida"

My husband and I will have 11 days in Scotland in early May 2024. Because I'm an inveterate planner (possibly obsessive LOL) I've been getting car rental quotes. We rented from Celtic Legend on our last trip in 2021 and they were wonderful. I can't recommend them enough actually.    Anyway I got a quote from them today for several different types of vehicles. Of course the lowest prices are for small standard transmission cars and I'm ok with that. I didn't have an automatic transmission vehicle until I was over 50!    However one of the quotes is for either a hybrid plug-in or an EV and I'm intrigued that that option. My concern is that we want to do a bit of hiking and we're more off the beaten path people - no whisky tours tourist castles etc. AND we want to do several day trips into Wester Ross from Inverness. I looked online to see where EV chargers are available - looks like Lochinver and Ullapool are our best bets - but my concern is whether those locations are reliable. As in... are the facilities likely to be closed not working etc?    We feel kind of guilty about the carbon footprint of flying from the US to the UK so I'm willing to pay a bit more for an EV or hybrid but I'd like advice from someone familiar with the challenges (if there are any) of keeping the car charged. We can hardly ask our Air BnB hosts to provide us with an extension cord LOL.    Inverness appears to have a lot of options but I worry about getting stuck in a remote location.    Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.    We'll be flying into EDI taking the train to Stonehaven spending a few days there picking up the car in Aberdeen driving along the Moray coast to Inverness spending a week in Inverness doing day trips to hike/sightsee. Our most far-flung destination will probably be Lochinver.    Then on to Glasgow for 3 nights turn in the car there and take the bus from Glasgow to EDI for our trip home. ,Larisa T,Scottish Highlands,"New Market, Alabama"
For roughly the same price I can get 3 apartments that suit our needs and I'm not sure which to choose!    Camden - good for nightlife (for the 3 young ladies who will be with me) and character but a bit further from some things    Fitzrovia (near Great Portland St. Station) - a bit closer to things but the flat is much smaller and the area lacks the nightlife and character of Camden though Soho isn't that far away. Is the fact that it is a bit closer and has more tube lines and buses available in walking distance worth sacrificing the space?    Marlin Aldgate East - this is safer in a way because I know it's a legit serviced apartment (the other 2 are on VRBO but with a long history of letting and lots of good reviews). However there are many terrible reviews. I am guessing that the individual units vary in quality and there's a chance we might get a bad one.    We have all been to London before and will not be visiting the typical tourist sites or museums. During the day we will visit markets parks (if the weather is decent) shopping etc. and at night we will have dinner and drinks and then the girls will party until late and I will retire or see a show in the West End. Camden has the advantage of nightlife in easy walking distance of the flat so they can party close to home. But from the Fitzrovia flat to Soho is not that far; similarly from Aldgate East to Shoreditch isn't far either.    I can keep my direct booking with Marlin until the day before check in though I prefer not to hog the booking for that long; however the other 2 are on VRBO so I need to choose between them. Any advice you can give me would be very much appreciated. Thanks! ,Bajanswife,London,Barbados
We have a near 24 hour layover in London on our return trip - landing LHR 16:30 on 30/12 and departing LHR 16:15 on 31/12. Family of 5 first trip to Europe for the kids (teens and tween).    Our plan is to get in to central London have dinner nearby on the 30th and then in the morning (New Years Eve Day) do a walking tour to see a couple of the major sites (Parliament Westminster Abbey Big Ben) before heading back to LHR.    I’ve narrowed our hotel choices to being near Piccadilly Paddington or Kensington. What would your preference be and why? TIA!! ,shopgirl,London,US
Hi we are very interested in possibly visiting Scotland next August with our 11 year old daughter and I have read lots about midges (and have confused myself in the process!)    I understand that August is peak midge season and that they are generally far worse in the west and in the islands but am I correct that we could visit Edinburgh and Loch Ness and not expect them to be a big problem? And are there other beautiful places that we can visit where midges are not terrible? We are not interested in camping or hiking deep in any forests but we would absolutely love to visit some castles and places of natural beauty such as the lochs and mountains. Since my wife and daughter tend to be very sensitive to mosquitoes and other insects we want to avoid areas where midges are generally the worst.    I would greatly appreciate any advice - thank you so much in advance! ,NYTravelerBD,Scotland,Westchester County...
We are in the initial planning for a trip in August of next year with our 3 adult children. We'll be in Dublin before driving to Belfast. We plan to spend 1 night in Belfast then 2 nights somewhere on our way to down to Doolin. We'd like to see the Giants Causeway and do a tour/tasting at Bushmills. We'd plan to have someone drive us to and from Bushmills. We'd like also to visit Donegal. I initially thought to drive from Belfast to Portrush stay in Portrush spend 1 day seeing Giants Causeway and Bushmills then just stop for lunch in Donegal.  Any better way to do this better base? Derry?? Any other suggestions? Thank you. ,Debbie R,Northern Ireland,"Orlando, FL"

Looking for some guidance on my initial plan. As a background my SO and I will fly from the US to London for a two-week trip. The trip includes London some family history exploration and then time in Scotland via rail and car.    The family portion of the trip includes Ringstead and possibly Sudbury to visit churches that our families attended from the early 17th century and prior. I know that I will need a rental car to get to Ringstead and am guessing that it will be easier to navigate if we pick up the car north of London. We will be returning it on a Sunday which makes it difficult to find a place that has a rental agency open for return.    So plan is to land at LHR take the National Express bus to London Luton Airport and rent the car there since those agencies would be open 7 days a week. Do our touring return the car to Luton and then take rail back to St. Pancras and the tube back to our hotel near Hyde Park.    Appreciate any constructive criticism or other ideas. I know there will be risks in driving the day we land but we are careful drivers and have driven on the left side of the road before. I will also read the entire highway code prior to arriving. Thanks for any help! ,Illiniwek66,London,Bloomington-Normal...
Coming to Anfield Stadium for a concert next summer. Looks like all the hotels near the stadium are already sold out. Would love some recommendations on lodging that is accessible by public transportation after the concert ( likely around midnight). I assume Taxi and Uber would not be good options after a big concert based on experiences in the US. Are the buses running that late? Where we are there are special buses after big events. Is that the case in Anfield as well?    We are deciding between flying to Liverpool via Dublin vs taking the train from London. Any insight to which option would be better? Cost would be about the same.    Thanks in advance! ,Misty43810,Liverpool,"Chicago, Illinois"

We're visiting Scotland in early April. Landing in Edinburgh for 2+ days. Also planning 3 days on the Isle of Skye plus 1-2 additional days in the Highlands. Our order is flexible as we haven't made any plans. We are considering extending our stay 2-3 days to visit Shetland most likely flying from Edinburgh and returning to Aberdeen to drive over to Skye. Is 2-3 days in Shetland worth the additional logistics and time? We don't want to be rushed but also want to visit if possible. ,Tom S,Shetland Islands,Minneapolis...

Hello We are 3 adults are staying at Aparthotel Adagio this weekend and I'm hoping someone can help me out with a few questions please?    1. What's the easiest way to get from the airport to the apartment? We should fit in a regular Uber if that's a reasonable option but what kind of price should I expect to pay?    2. Will there be a few restaurants open close to the apartment tomorrow night for dinner? Where would you recommend?    3. I'd really like to get to one of the big Asda superstores in the city and/or Matalan and You @ Sainsbury's (we don't have these shops in Ireland). My question is is there an area where these shops are close to each other? Will I have to take a taxi to them or are there bus routes that go close by?    Thanks so much really looking forward to seeing the beautiful city again it has been years! ,IrishM,Edinburgh,

In May I will be traveling throughout Scotland. I plan to devote 2 full days in Wester Ross and would like to know how best to divide my time enjoying the natural beauty there. We will arrive early evening the day before the 2 full days and plan to stay in or near Torridon. We would like to hike in the Lake Maree area the first day. and perhaps stay that night in Torridon area again. The next morning we would head for Skeillag and Applecross and stay overnight in the area. Or we could stay in or between the Applecross area and the route to Eilean Donan castle which we will visit the next day before going to Portree. Any thoughts on how to best divide our time in order to best appreciate the surroundings and have time for a few walks or hikes? Thank you in advance. ,Bronna L,Scotland,"New York City, New..."

Hello all! Planning a trip to Paris next May with my family and would love to take a quick trip to London over night. Planning to come into London via Eurostar. Do you all think Charing Cross hotel is a good base location to see a few sights? Probably considering British Museum. Tower of London St Paul’s Cathedral Big Ben and London Eye. We will not have time for all of these but gives you a general idea of areas we may be going.

I will soon be coming to Liverpool for a one week holiday staying in a hotel in the city centre.    Some of the parking charges I am seeing for City Centr Car parks are ridiculous such as £18 for 24 hours or even £24 for 24 hours !    I will be leaving my car for about seven days so this starts to get expensive.    After an extensive Internet search I’ve found “mount pleasant car park” near The Adelphi.  It’s a Liverpool city council park and says “more than 3 hours £5”    Does anyone local have experience of using this car park and is it okay?  Will the £5 charge apply for each 24 hours period as I’ll be leaving the car in there for the whole seven days.    Alternatively is there a safer street with free parking just outside the central controlled zone such as in Vauxhall? ,Kopite52,Liverpool,Sentosa Island...

Hi all! I am working on an itinerary for 4 woman to travel to Scotland in mid-April 2024. None of us have been to Scotland before. I expect that the weather will be cold and unpredictable - perhaps similar to April In Massachusetts. This is the itinerary we have so far. I'm interested in feedback on what I have so far and help figuring out the last couple of days.    April 12 - 14: Stay on the Royal Mile (possible activities include: Edinburgh Castle Arthur's Seat Hike Victoria St shopping high tea Sheep's Heid Inn maybe Chocolatarium etc)    April 14: Finish up Edinburgh activities in the morning then head out. Head to Ochiltree (I know this is out of the way and does not look like there is anything to do here however a group member has relatives from here and wants to drive through) and then to Fort William area (Loch Leven Hotel) to spend the night. I imagine we won't have time for much more than driving this day.    April 15 - 19: Head to Glenfinnan Viaduct to watch the train go by for our HP fans Eileen Donan Castle and then go to Harrapool where we will be staying for 4 nights. Our plan is to explore Skye for 2 full days (16th and 17th) and then maybe take a rest day in Harrapool or see anything we haven't yet had time to check out in the area. I think I have a decent itinerary figured out for Skye.    April 19: Adventure down to stay in Pitlochry for the night    April 20: Pitlochry to Edinburgh    April 21: Fly out early    I'm a little overwhelmed with options for things to do those last 2 days. We love beautiful vistas charming towns light hiking etc. I also imagine we may be getting tired 7 days in. Any suggestions about things preferred things to do between Skye and Pitlochry and Edinburgh? Or a route back that you think would be better? Thanks so much for any feedback/suggestions! ,Alison B,Scotland,

I have looked at bus and train maps read suggestions on the forum but I am a little confused. I will be arriving from Spain on British Airways on a day in late November (I assume this will be terminal 5) at 2:30 in the afternoon. My American Airlines flight leaves at 11 AM the following morning - I am assuming from Terminal 3. Ideally I would like to get a hotel right off of one of the main transport lines where I can jump back on in the morning and go straight to terminal 3. Ideally without too many changes in buses or trains or types of transportation. I only intend to take the Elizabeth Line or the Picadilly Line somewhere not too far just too look around a bit. Perhaps I could take an evening bus tour depending on where the meeting and drop off points were. I intend to be back at the hotel before midnight go to sleep then get up in the morning and take whatever transport is quickest back to terminal 3. Can someone offer a very simple choice of a decent hotel - start at $100 - $150 for the night with easy transportation options that will be easy to get to from Terminal 5 and easy to get back to Terminal 3. I had considered the Holiday Inn near Terminal 4 or one of the hotels that you can easily get to on the Hoppa Bus but I have no idea which hotel is easiest to go somewhere from or to get a transport to Terminal 3 in the morning. I need to stay in a hotel fairly close to the airport because I am slow in the morning. Thanks so much ,Cindy E,London,
Beginning the process of planning our first trip to London. Traveling on or near the above dates with our two adult children (20’s and 30’s)  as this accommodates their work schedules. I have checked hotels on several sites and am somewhat overwhelmed as to the best choice for our family of four. We are looking for something near public transportation restaurants and some sightseeing. Preferably moderately priced.  Tentatively we plan to stay in London for three or four days and then take a side trip to Sudbury Liverpool/Manchester and Stonehenge. We will not have a rental car while in London but are considering one for this. We plan to return to London for a day or so before our return flight.

We thought we might like to spend 3 nights in a country house style of hotel/castle hotel in between our Edinburgh and Inverness stops next year on our family trip from Australia.  We plan to pick up a car as we leave Edinburgh and would like to stay somewhere within 30 minute drive of Stirling so we can explore the area a bit.  We are 2 adults + 2 children (7&10) and hope to find somewhere that does breakfast and maybe has an indoor swimming pool that’s nice to look at in a pretty setting.

Hello friendly travelers. I am. UK based want to be traveler to the US. Hubby and I have a few pre-existing medical issues. I saw Staysure but they have a bad reputation according to what I've seen. Then I saw Avanti Insurance which would cover us at a relatively costly fee (about £700 for both of us). I was thinking they would get out business but I now see they are related to Staysure. Possibly even the same company. So many other companies that would have worked for us are not accepting new customers in the current covid times. We will be getting insurance can't afford not to for a US trip but is there any company out there that will actually protect us without putting us through the wringer if we need to file a claim?

Hi all. Not sure you can assist but we will be visiting that area in May 2024 (elderly relatives up that way) & Tarbet is the closest town to them. Any suggestion of where to stay would be most appreciated. (For 2 couples.).  TIA ,PGSydney,Scotland,"Sydney, Australia"
Arriving to Heathrow Terminal 4 this Saturday. Always took cab which is long and close to 150 pounds. The reason for it I don’t want to drag my suitcases I am quite petit and always have computer bag rolled in carry on and checked in roll in. Please don’t tell me to pack efficiently that’s already efficient for me. But am willing to try public transportation this time. Need to go to DoubleTree Docklands. Google tells me:  1) Elizabeth line change on Bond to Elizabeth line to Bermondsey then bus C10 or will take cab.  2) Elizabeth line change on Whitechapel Overground Crystal Place then bus 381 Peckham or cab  3) Elizabeth line to Canary Wharf then walk 14 min and take hotel boat to doubletree – seems the best with the exception of 14 min walking with those luggage.    All show 1 hr 30 min which is the same to driving. Given my luggage which route you would recommend to take? Thank you. ,InfinitSilver,London,Canada
I looked up for trains from Manchester to SUA for travel in December '23 but there seem to be no direct trains? All trains I see are with 2 changes.    Am I searching it correct ?

We will be driving down from Bristol to Appledore on Tuesday 31 Oct to check in after 4pm.  If the day is half-decent we are thinking of driving along the coast from Minehead rather than going down the M5 / A361.  Please can anyone recommend a good cafe where we can get a light lunch somewhere on the coast between Minehead and (say) Ilfracombe / Woolacombe.  We don't need a big pub meal because we are eating in a pub in the evening.  I'd be grateful for any suggestions.  Thanks ,Chris H,Devon,"Bristol, United..."
Investigating best way after international flight landing in the morning midweek. Seems that we need to transfer to the other Gatwick terminal but once luggage is collected seems like an easy transfer to the southhampton train station with taxi to hotel. The cost of private car is a bit pricey for 2 unless they announce a strike in which cause it will be booked asap. Am I missing a better transfer option? Make sense to prebook tickets for convenience? TIA ,Colie,Southampton,"Ontario, Canada"

On Thursday week I'm planning a one-night stopover en route from Tonbridge in Kent to Ross-on-Wye. If the weather is halfway decent I'd be looking to follow a route avoiding motorways and major trunk roads as far as practicable so I was planning to follow the wonderful A272 westwards through Sussex and then head generally north-westwards via Andover towards Marlborough. I don't know the town particularly well but there seems to be a few well-reviewed places to stay so I thought it might be a reasonable shout as a place to break the journey. Any thoughts about this - are there a few nice pubs and/or other eating places to occupy the evening and maybe a few antique/collectable-type shops to nose around the following morning before I head off to Ross? ,FawltyTowersWatch,Marlborough,"Stockport, United..."

I tried searching on the forum and could find no mention of a short-term rental management company called “Pass the Keys.” I ask because a rental on Airbnb is associated with them but also listed less expensively on Booking.com and the company’s personal website.    The listing has nine positive reviews on AirBnb but only one review on Booking and zero on the company’s site. It seems to be a middle man company for folks wanting to lease out their homes/flats. Does anyone have experience with this company are they legitimate?

My friend is looking for things to do that don't involve too much walking. She and her husband are in their earky 70's and have been to the major attractions. They are staying near St Pancras and are already going to a show. Last time I recommended The Sky Garden which she loved. I live in the North of England but often visit London however my trips usually involve lots of walking. So far I have suggested a boat trip to Greenwich and the Hop on Hop off bus. Any suggestions wmfor something a little different or a quirky place to eat would be worth derful. Many thanks ,tecjunkie,London,"Leeds, United..."

My husband turns 60 in July 2025 and I want to give him a lifetime trip so I'm planning now. He's not scratch but good and an avid golfer. Where in the world would you suggest for a week long golf trip? We golf Caribbean/N. America so thinking more Europe.Normally I'm pretty good planning my own travels/accommodations but if there are packages or golf travel agents-I am not opposed. The only agent I know is in Punta Cana and we have done that--very nice but not a lifetime trip. BUDGET? haha well that always counts. I'm thinking $5kpp. And although St. Andrews is the grand daddy of golfing I don't want to limit my search. ,Charstorm,,"Chicago, IL"
Our family of four adults spending the Christmas holidays in Paris and London this year. We arrive London by train the evening of Wednesday 27 December then depart from LHR the afternoon of Sunday 31 December - giving us 3 full days in London. Staying at the Thistle Piccadilly hotel so close to both Piccadilly and Leicester Square Tube stations.    Given the short daylight hours we have planned some indoor activities for night time in order to leave daytime open. We have already booked Warner Bros/Harry Potter Studio Tour at 17:00 on Thursday evening and have pre-theatre dinner reservations at 17:30 at The Ivy with tickets for Les Mis on Saturday night. Also plan to take advantage of the British Museum’s Friday night opening but have not yet reserved a slot - thinking 17:00 to 18:00 staying 2-3 hours then late dinner after that.    We have not yet booked any other tickets but seems we need to do so soon so please advise on this tentative 3-day plan.    Thursday 28 December:    09:00 - Visit Tower of London including Crown Jewels and Yeoman Warder’s tour. View Tower Bridge from the area but no tour of the bridge.    Next St. Paul’s Cathedral - booking an admission time slot but not taking a tour.    Lunch somewhere in City of London - recommendations on a good pub?    Return to Hotel by 15:00 in order to be at Leicester Square tube by 15:30 to begin journey by Tube/Train to Watford Junction for Harry Potter tour.    Friday 29 December:    Travel by train to Windsor to tour Windsor Castle and St. George Chapel.    Lunch in Windsor.    If back in time visit Fortnum and Mason - fairly close to our hotel.    Early evening admission to British Museum followed by a late dinner.    Saturday 30 December:    09:00 - Admission and tour of Westminster Abbey. Hope to do the Verger’s Tour but unsure how those work - do you just join one as they start after you enter the Abbey?    Following the Abbey plan to walk around and view from the outside - Parliament Elizabeth Tower Buckingham Palace - not interested in Changing of the Guard.    Afternoon visit to Harrods leaving in time to return to hotel to change before early Dinner and West End show.    Also plan to do some nighttime walking around to view the Christmas lights on Regent St Oxford St etc. - seems like many of the decorated areas are near our hotel.    We would welcome any comments advice or changes. It is our first time visit to London.  Thank you all so much. ,CruzVet,London,

We searched through the various options for our recent trip to St Andrews. We used Club Cars St Andrews to pick us up at the airport and transfer us to our accommodation in St Andrews. The driver was wonderful and ointes out several highlights in the city before dropping us at our apartment. We used Clu Cars again to transfer us to our hotel in central Edinburgh three days later. No complaints and Trudy the manager was a pleasure to deal with. Prices were reasonable. ,Pirouette1,St. Andrews,"Vancouver, Canada"

We are staying at the Ibis Styles London Heathrow on Bath Road in December.      1 - We are coming in from Manchester Piccadilly by train which station should be have be our end point Heathrow Terminal 2 and then bus/taxi to the hotel or should we go to a different station and bus/taxi from there? What makes the most sense economically and logistically?    2 - Similar question above - we are attending an Arsenal game while we are there what would be the best way to get to the stadium from the hotel? Underground rail - if so what stations should I use?    Apologies for asking but I have been looking at paths for the last day or so and just cannot seem to figure out what makes the most sense.    Thanks in advance for your help. ,Greg S,London,
Hi  I'm really struggling with where to stay in London. We have a larger 3 month trip planned through Europe and are starting with 4 nights in London.  Arriving to Heathrow about 5:45am spending our 5th night at Gatwick Airport Hotel for an early morning flight to Lisbon.    Never been to London before so would like to see all the main sites. Not planning any day trips just as much of London as we can see. I'm not particularly interested in Greenwich so thinking the centre and west might be our best bet.    In a place to stay I'm hoping for a kitchenette a washer and dryer and if possible air conditioning it will be early April so I'm not sure we'll need the aircon. Budget would be about $750 GPB but I'd prefer to keep it closer to $700 GBP. I'm looking for something with good tube connections as well. Is Earls Court a good area? I accept we will need to stay a bit further out with our budget.    I'd love a place with a bit of character but as long as it's clean and in a safe area with a decent pub nearby we'll make it work.    Any suggestions would be welcomed! Booking.com Expedia and Agoda are not my cooperating with my budget at the minute...  Thanks! ,Shay B,London,"Brisbane, Australia"
Thinking to add a show to my itinerary next week. I watched Moulin Rouge in London. Absolutely loved it! I watched Hamilton in London too. Enjoyed it! But would have preferred something more entertaining or emotional if you will. Watched Chicago musical and Wicked in Chicago and it was medium to my liking. Watched Moulin Rouge in Paris and it was fine…. My best is Moulin Rouge in London because it was emotional to me. All were sitting with wet eyes… I like something like that I guess although I do not consider myself sensitive person.    What would you recommend for me? Something similar along the same line but not too sentimental? Something more iconic? Thinking King Lion? How is it? Heard Phantom of Opera pretty iconic? Back to the future? Sounds unusual to me… ,InfinitSilver,London,Canada

Their website just says Most of our twin rooms have a comfy double or kingsize bed with a single sofa bed some have two single or double beds.

Due to a major resignalling project the service on five lines will be suspended until around 15.00 (3pm) on Saturday 11th November.    There will be no service before 3pm on the entire Circle Line District Line Hammersmith & City Line and Jubilee Line. The Metropolitan Line will not operate between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Aldgate; however passengers travelling to or from central London will be able to use the Chiltern Railways service between Harrow-on-the-Hill and London Marylebone.    Limited rail replacement bus services will operate on outer sections of the affected routes however where possible passengers should use alternative rail routes and local bus connections.    All other Underground lines - Bakerloo Central Northern Piccadilly and Victoria - will be operating normally as will the Elizabeth Line the Docklands Light Railway and London Overground (with the exception of the Highbury & Islington - New Cross Gate/Clapham Junction route which is suspended all day). Most National Rail services will also be operating normally in the London area although there will be reduced services to and from London Euston. ,wirewiper,London,"Torquay, United..."

Hello! We are spending this long weekend based just outside Weymouth and wondering what we can realistically do given a pretty showery/wet forecast.  We are hoping to do some sightseeing and walking and just general relaxing and enjoying the area! We will have a car and want to see some of the sights like Golden Cap or Cerne Abbas - but not sure we will want to stray too far from a car park/cafe just in case the heavens open!  Generally we don’t like busy areas but do like countryside pretty villages and good food! Will the Dorset hotspots (Lulworth Chesil Weymouth Portland Lyme Regis Abbotsbury be very busy? What mid-range dining (with vegan options) would anyone suggest that is easy to do if it’s raining!  We do need to pick up someone arriving at Weymouth station too (is that feasible?!) so parking ideas for Weymouth itself. And is Portland Bill a good trip?

Our last day in Oxford. We woke to light rain and planned our day over bread cheese coffee and our glass of bubbly; we headed across to the Ashmolean as it opened. What a gem that museum is. We had specific goals Ucello’s The Hunt in the Forest is always fascinating. I love the room with the tapestries and the musical instruments which include two Stradivarius violins The Messiah The Cipriani Potter; there was such skill involved in making these and other instruments and the room itself is a musical feast. Moving on I came across a painting of Piazza del Popoli in Rome where we had visited several times in August. Pisarro’s painting of the Tuileries Gardens on a rainy day reminded me that Paris is beautiful even when it is raining. One of the Dutch Master’s works features ice skating with a compelling winter scene and then that very detailed lace work in a painting by Van Dyck the ruff looking terribly uncomfortable. And Rodin’s The Age of Bronze. Oh so much to see and do in such a short visit!    A scone with the works was in my dreams and we visited the café before leaving but oh the disappointment! Jam yes butter yes cream no! The server said they had not been able to get it for months! Cows on strike? Later I thought I should have suggested they contact the V&A in London where there seemed to be no shortage. Anyway the jam was blackcurrant one of my favourites so the scone was more than “ half full” and a pot of orange rooibos tea was delicious.    An organ concert was next and we made our way to Queen’s College and soaked up a blissful 45 minutes of Bach and Jan Pieterszoon Swielinck; I later found the concert on YouTube and here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2VtgwvzudQ    On we ventured to the History of Science Museum which really is a history of scientific instruments such as astrolabes quadrants and telescopes. It is marvellous! A very engaged group of school children was enthusiastically exploring under the supervision of teacher and accompanying adults; as a retired teacher I loved this school outing.    Across the road was The White Horse another Morse haunt and we popped in for a pint sitting under the only remaining memorabilia a photo of Morse and Lewis. Unfortunately a group of men in their 50s I’d guess were sitting within earshot and one in particular had a rather rough limited unfiltered vocabulary and his volume control button was defective.    The next few hours flew by as we got lost in both The Museum of Natural History and Pitt Rivers. I do believe I gasped when I walked in. Oh my stars! Both really deserve several hours; my sweetheart an academic well-versed in Evolutionary Biology and all things Darwinian was in his element while I with a background in Anthropology got lost in the Pitt Rivers collection. A word of caution here; if one started here in the morning all lunch and dinner plans might be abandoned. It is worth noting the strong commitment to ethical respectful representation of cultures and though colonization is acknowledged it is not condoned. That’s a whole long discussion in itself.    When we emerged just before closing the skies had opened and we made our way back to The Randolph umbrellas being well controlled no Mary Poppins moves for us and this time got closer to the fire in the Morse Bar but alas two different people were settled in the prime seats with two newspapers each. A G&T ordered much less ice please ie don’t drown the gin and a glass of wine and we talked about the great things we had seen. Oxford is a cultural haven and we had only skimmed the surface. We rested knees in our room for a bit and with lashing rain a decision was made to return to The White Rabbit for dinner and we got the table we’d had two nights before. We ordered different pizzas and ales all great and soaked up the atmosphere; a group of students a few families with young kids playing a card game couples and everyone having a good time. A meander back hand in hand and we were inside the hotel within ten minutes not too soaked but very happy with our day’s accomplishments.    Next morning after our coffee and easy breakfast we checked out and headed to the train station. A £7 taxi ride got us there quickly and we were a lot drier than had we walked. Our train arrived and it was time to say “ farewell” to lovely Oxford which will continue to call to us and a return visit hopefully longer than three nights will be on the wish list.    Finally a sincere “ Thank-you”to those on the forum who gave me great suggestions re: places to eat and a nudge to visit the Botanic Gardens. As it was we were happily fed and watered but will keep all recommendations on our list.    Pirate 🏴‍☠️ ,Pirate 🏴‍☠️,Oxford,"Toronto, Canada"
And to Oxford that centre of academia! There is something about being there that makes me think smarter! We already correct our grammar eg fewer rather than less using adverbs appropriately but around these hallowed halls I think twice. It is rather cerebral! I love the bustling atmosphere of students everywhere bicycles galore though less invasive than Amsterdam and there is just a hive of activity! Our three- train journey from Surrey was uneventful and we arrived at Oxford Station on time and were at the Randolph Hotel in about 20 minutes. Since our room was not quite ready we settled in the Morse Bar with a glass of wine. For those who have watched the wonderful series based on Colin Dexter’s books you will appreciate the pleasure of sitting in the bar in which he wrote and where the character Inspector Morse both drank and thought. Photos of both Morse and Lewis grace the walls. Our room for which we had bid and won a £30 per night upgrade looked across to The Ashmolean; the extra cost was worth it. I’ll do a separate review but will say that apart from the Nespresso machine issue no water going in all was smooth.    Comfortable bed and bedding mini fridge biscuits tea and coffee making facilities good lighting; the bare necessities of life. Once settled in we headed off for a good walk just enjoying the “ being there” among the old buildings ancient stones the gorgeous skyline arched doorways iron hardware. Eventually our packable grocery bags led us to the Jericho Cheese Company; we tasted and purchased Montgomery Cheddar and another raw milk farmhouse Lancashire Cheddar. Then on to Tesco where a bottle of Cava and one of Rioja got added with a sourdough baguette. Somehow the travel days get the better of us so we decided on an early meal; we checked at The White Rabbit and were told that reservations were taken only for parties of 8 but that the busiest time was after 6. We returned around the corner at 5:45. Again there will be a separate review but this was a great spot. A big Thanks! to the Oxford forum participants for the recommendation. The energy in the pub the friendly service and proximity to the hotel were all plusses. Back in the room emails were sent family messages read laughed over and added to reassuring them that we were still living the good life. A good night’s sleep under a fluffy duvet was in order. Goodnight charming Oxford.    We woke up next morning to clear blue skies and after a no-show with the defunct Nespresso machine which we don’t like anyway we made tea had some bread and cheese as well as our traditional glass of bubbly a toast to another day together. We eventually headed out mentioning the coffee machine concern at Reception and our route to Christchurch Meadows took us past several great bookstores where we were pulled in drawn like bees to jam. Of course there are bookshops; it is a university city! The Book Stop first by The Randolph and then St Phillip’s; lovely loitering lost in the pages as time slipped away. We continued meandering and spent a good half hour over a glass of wine at The Head of the River another Morse location watching pairs of mallards just putting in time as ducks do and seeing the occasional pleasure boat go by. Onwards and upwards actually the other way round and we retraced steps to the Meadows. It was so pleasant to be off the streets away from the shrill sirens; I think the hearing-aid business here must be thriving. We made our way to the Botanic Gardens where we got a good dose of gardening pleasure. The greenhouses were wonderfully tropical and the plants including tobacco cotton aloe vera and pineapple well labeled and with some informative writing. Outside delphiniums were still in bloom as were some daisies and roses. Living as we do in a colder climate this was just a joy. We admired the various beds the plant supports the clay domes used to force rhubarb and other early spring plants. A climbing rose covered in tiny buds was entwined in a twig archway; it belonged in a fairytale painting.    Though dry it was a blustery day and we poked around in more bookshops on the way back. Last stop was Blackwell’s where there must be tens of thousands of books; a true haven for bibliophiles. It has such a welcoming atmosphere with comfortable chairs a-plenty. Then back to the hotel where though our room had been “ done” the Nespresso machine remained on strike. I mentioned it again and was assured it would get attention. We plonked ourselves on chairs at the Morse Bar and sipped drinks; an awaited G&T for me a dry martini for my sweetheart. We eyed the two prize chairs by the fireplace where a couple had settled in with with drinks and several newspapers; I intended to check later to see if they had moved but forgot to do so. Knees were groaning a bit so we returned to our room where a replacement coffee machine was awaiting. We later bundled up and took a pleasant 20 minute walk to The Old Bookbinder’s Ale House in Jericho. We meandered past lovely old stone walls a stone house almost covered in ivy multi-painted row houses in pastel colours where propped bicycles added charm and a fancy restaurant with white table linens; that was not our destination; we were off to the pub! An extra big THANKS! again to the Oxford forum participants for suggesting The Old Bookbinder’s; this was a real find. I’ll write a separate review but the creamy button and wild mushroom soup was superb. There were stacks of cards and board games the walls and ceiling covered with coasters and service was pleasant and attentive. Top marks! An hour or so later had us retracing our steps and heading to the Land of Nod. A lovely day in Oxford had been enjoyed to the full. There is one more post to finish spinning a yarn about our final day.    Pirate 🏴‍☠️ ,Pirate 🏴‍☠️,Oxford,"Toronto, Canada"

After a LOT of research and thanks to everyone on here who has helped me out below is my proposed itinerary for our trip to Scotland late May. We will have a rental car. Accommodations are booked. We are coming from a week in Ireland so should be totally acclimated to the time zone. YES I know there is a lot of driving in this itinerary Yes the four of us are prepared for this and ready to share in this. We are OK with the driving because we want to see as much as we can and we have tried to also give ourselves time to take walks enjoy some live music and great pubs and relax and just take in as much of this beautiful country as we can. Other than the fact that it's a lot of driving did we make any mistakes or miss anything that is not to be missed? Are there any suggestions of great restaurants or rest stops or route suggestions (esp for Days 2 4 and 9)? Thank you for your time and help!!

Hello    We will be in Edinburgh in May coming off a transatlantic cruise and will be staying in Scotland for seven days. We wish to take a 3-day tour with Rabbies who has a strict luggage policy. Since we will be staying at the same hotel (still not decided) at the beginning and end of the week is it reasonable to think that a hotel might store our luggage for those three days since we are returning guests? We will each have one large luggage and a handbag.    Does anyone know how to email the hotels? Thanks so much in advance. ,Donna G,,"Westerville, Ohio"

I am visiting London soon after not visiting for a long time and there are some things I have forgotten. I hope some Londoners can help me out!    I used to buy a weekly Travelcard. I see they are now 7-Day travelcards so I presume they can run on any seven days? In the past seven-day travelcards ran from 4:30 am on Monday until 4:29 am the following Monday.    I still have an Oyster account but no idea where my card is. I guess I will just have to buy a new one...

Hi.    I got so many great ideas on my previous post so here i am again :-)    Tomorrow on a beautiful sunny day we are driving from Ullapool en route to Dunrobin castle. We are staying near Dingwall    One option is to drive from Ullapool up north to Durness and Eribol then via Lairg to Dunrobin finishing in Dingwall.    Another option is to drive from Ullapool to Dunrobin then north to Whaligoe steps and Duncasby stacks and then back to Dingwall (i dont like the need to drive up and down twice but i really would want to explore this area not sure if its worth it).    Which option would be better for this one day trip and more scenic? What we should include to fully pack this in one day?    Thank you :-) ,Miha Š,Scotland,"Ljubljana, Slovenia"

Hello everyone! I apologize first of all for my English.  I'll be in England in May for a concert this is my first time buying from SeeTickets.com and I'm a bit puzzled.  I purchased two tickets through Fan to Fan (the site's official resale service) since the event was almost sold out.I also paid a fair resale fee provided by the service.  At the time of purchase I was assigned an order number.  After a few days I received pdf of the tickets via e-mail from the seller:the tickets are in his name and with his order number.  I contacted support to ask if this is normal and they replied that yes it's normal.  So the resale of the tickets doesn't involve changing the name etc.: it's equivalent to a sale between private individuals with only a pdf being sent.The ticket remains exactly the same.  Frankly I don't feel protected in this.The seller seemed trustworthy to mebut potentially with this system tickets can be sold indefinitely.  Traveling from Italy for this concert the last thing I want is to have surprises at the entrance of the event.  I'm asking those of you who have experience with Fan to Fan if resale actually works this way and if you have ever had any problems.  Many many thanks  Anna ,Anna L,London,
Hi    We are a group of 7 staying at Candahar Street.    Welcome pickups have quoted £74 which sounds resonable. Can anyone recommend another company so I can compare please?    Also we can't checkin till 3pm so will be waiting around for a few hours can anyone recommend pubs/food places to go while we wait please.    Finally whats the best option for getting into central belfast - looking to head to Laverys for the football at night or the Duke of York area. Is there a bus service? (how much much) if not can anyone recommend any taxi companies and a rough cost please.    Any help would be greatly appreciated.    Thanks ,Yorkies,Belfast,
Be very very careful of this company. We had the most terrible experience ever on the eve of Boxing Day 2015. We flew in at 2145 but didn't get our car until 0240 - nearly five hours of waiting. The communication was appalling so we had no idea if/when we'd get our car. Many customers were left waiting for hours without knowing what was happening to their car. The company had even lost the keys of three customers! I strongly advise you not to use this company. ,PorkyMartin,Crawley,"Portsmouth, United..."

I have already booked a tour to isle of skye during the first few days of my arrival so perhaps another area like stirling would be better?

I currently have a cancellable reservation at Bread Street Kitchen on Christmas Day; and also an opportunity to get a reservation at Philharmonic. I will be in London on New Year's Eve so was thinking to switch to Bread Street Kitchen in London on NYE and Philharmonic on Xmas Day (as it is more iconic?). But I am worried that a pub will feel too casual. We are a small family (two adults and one child). Not from UK so will be far from any other family. So I would like a place that will feel communal and festive (music entertainment if possible). Worried that a pub will feel cheesy/stodgy? Price is not really an issue. Hubby wants something special.

My daughter and I are traveling to the UK from the US for a week for her to attend Open Days/tours at universities in England - 3 in London 1 in Loughborough and 1 in Newcastle. What do you recommend for travel among the cities? I prioritize ease/lower-stress/lower-travel-time over travel cost. We're seeing Loughborough on Wednesday the London schools on Th Fri Sat and can visit Northumbria on Tuesday preferably or Sunday.    Plane tickets from our US city to London and plane tix from our city to Newcastle are about the same price. Train from London to Newcastle adds about US$300 to the overall travel cost and subtracts about 2h from the overall travel time (if flight from US is on time which is a crap shoot). I haven't looked at flights from London to Newcastle and don't even know if people fly between cities in the same country in Europe vs take the train.    Also for trains - is Lumo worth the lesser travel cost from London Northeastern Rail? (I won't fly Frontier JetBlue Spirit because of all the issues that come with their budget costs so am guessing I'd prefer LNER.) ,CO7668,,"Denver, Colorado"

Hi folks the last couple of years for New Year we (my wife and I both 50ish) have went to Catterick races on new years day. For new years eve we stayed in Barnard Castle. It was ideal 6 or 7 hotels / bars / restaurants enough for us to pass the night away and into 1am or so. This year we are thinking of Bedale before Catterick races. Is it similar will the bars / hotels be open for the bells. We'd hate to book and find that the bars are all closed for hogmanay / new year. Any info appreciated. ,ladyboy40,North Yorkshire,ladyboy40

Dear Friends  I need your help. My parent was traveling with EUSS (EU Settlement Scheme Family  Permit) from Ecuador to United kingdom. The permit was given for 6 months to join me in UK.  The first ticket I bought with return within 8 Months (after the EUSS Permit expire). The travel date KLM Airlines denied-boarding because they said the return ticket should be within 6 months.  At time KLM staff treated the EUSS permit as TOURIST VISA.  I believe the EUSS permit doesn't required return ticket as this EUSS permit is given to join a family member in UK. Also with this permit can work live permanently in UK.  TO MAKE SHORT I BOUGHT A NEW TICKETS FOR THE NEXT DAY. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED. ,Juan D,,

A thank you to all that helped me plan the trip…I did post this in the trip report thread but since that thread is often overlooked and a huge thread with 14 years of reports I thought I would just go ahead and post it here as well.    Day 1: Yeah! We are on a London Paris and Prague 20 day fall trip and … the first sign of problems—the flight was delayed an hour. Another sign of problems— it was now delayed 2 more hours. When they offered us free meal vouchers I was very suspicious and rightfully so— the flight was then delayed 3 more hours and instead of 8:25pm we would be leaving at 2:45 am. Okay the meal helped.    We get right up to the gate literally lined up with boarding passes and they tell us we are short one pilot! The flight is cancelled. “You are on your own is basically the message. That is if we heard correctly with the crowd screaming and yelling at the staff. What a show of unhappy people! Someone yelled that they just lost 8k…    Lessons learned: if this happens to you immediately pull up the airline flight and go to cancellations and delays and choose another flight from that step and no you wont get charged the new price if you do a change from there. (I waited because i wasn't sure and missed the first flight. Many just stood in line for over an hour only to find that the flights were all booked. United also emailed hotel and lyft vouchers (to our wrong email so this delayed us also but that was my fault). So we stayed the night at a hotel with voucher from the airline and they were nice enough to allow us to pay only 40$ to stay till 4pm this next day ! (Be sure to ask). A lifesaver to my back!    Day 2: Finally off! So we spent that time resting and extending our stay by a day in London and rebooking tours. (We will have to file with our travel insurance for reimbursement for a hotel night and two short day tours we couldn't cancel but hey not too bad.    So far no further delays..knocked on wood. We take the hotel shuttle back to the airport with more food vouchers and I was now happy with United again because they gave us 7500 miles each. Lesson learned: be sure to go to the link if you get an email from the airline saying they care and inviting you to go to a link. They don't tell you about the gift and I half expected just a survey and would have missed out. Our flight leaves at 8:25 pm on time with the two of us exhausted and not sitting together each of us in a middle seat but thankful to be departing at least!    Day 2: Buckingham Palace Tour! So we land in London and we are happy to find that our checked bag made it too! Many of you will recall that I was a bit scared of the underground so we took a cab 10 min to the small Feltham train station. The taxi driver didn’t seem to mind that short trip and it cost 30pounds including a tip. We managed to buy two 8.50pound tickets to the London Waterloo station. This was an interesting trip because I like to see areas that are not just set up for tourists and this described Feltham even though this area does look somewhat poor. We had no problems getting to London in 40 minutes total and I avoided the underground and the expensive taxi! The walk to our hotel was a long 10 minutes with luggage but many around us had no problems.    Our hotel is in the Waterloo area with a huge room that has a kitchen. It is very comfortable and well priced— more on that later! We rushed out to catch a 3:45pm Buckingham Palace tour with no lines there and it was much grander than I expected! It really is worth seeing if you have time. The walk afterwards to the exit is a lovely walk by the lake and it is easy to forget you are in a big city. I was so glad we went on this tour and we spent about 2 hours total. We had a delicious pizza and wine at a nice small Italian place next to our hotel served by an Italian family.. and we crashed soon afterwards.    Day 3: Bletchley Park and the Computer Science Museum! Oh and Harry Potters 9 3/4 Platform:) Of course we woke at 3:45am unable to really go back to sleep so we were dressed and around to the corner cafe for a good cup of coffee and muffins at 7am. The weather is enjoyable-Cloudy and a bit damp with pleasant weather. We decided to be adventurous and take the underground after all and it was just across the street at the North Lambert Station. The underground here is deep and old. And it was exciting! Very efficient and we went fast! We took the Bakerloo line and I was distracted enough with a conversation with a gentleman sitting next to me who was telling me more about the underground after he noticed it was new to me. It was very helpful because by the time I looked around we were whizzing by with walls very close to the train and I had a tinge of claustrophobia but it passed with the excitement of the ride. ... and then the Oxford Circus stop came up and it was easy to follow the signs and learn. This all was an amazing experience and I am so glad that I didn’t miss it so thanks to everyone on the forum who encouraged me to give it a try.    We got out at Eustan Station and I was surprised to see that we had to buy rail tickets and then stand and wait for the announcement of the platform only 4 or 5 minutes before the train left! Everyone almost runs! We missed the first train. We enjoyed looking at the scenery on the way to Bletchley Park and took pictures of the sheep so that we could tell the grandkids that we saw “Shaun the sheep” from their cartoon. I highly recommend a day at this park! besides being lovely with a beautiful lake to walk around It has a grand gothic mansion with amazing woodwork inside— I want to live in a house just like this! But that just makes it a pretty setting. What makes this place is the story of what happened here and what mostly young ladies in their 20s did to basically win the war with code breaking . Well 3/4 of the people were women. There were enough men to have plenty of romance stories out on that lake. It is one of the best well-done museums I have seen in the world. The original huts are still there and they have managed to give you a sense of what it is like to step into them and step back into the 1940s. (They have a tour but we didn’t stay with it.. the lady giving the tour is interesting enough but she just walks around outside talking and we felt time with her was using up our time to actually see things! Until she incorporates her talk inside the huts I would say to skip this tour!- Which is more like a lecture that is very difficult to hear!)    We spent all day there and I would like to go back. It has some thing for everyone especially the geeks and nerds who love code breaking puzzles mystery mathematics etc. Do NOT miss the computer science building next door. You will not see any signs advertising it or with directions but when you walk out of the visitors center make a U-turn and go up the hill until you see finally a sign and it is on your right. It holds the colossus the bomb and all the cool computers you’ll ever want to see. And for those my age you get a glimpse back into your early days of the first Apple computer your first calculator and even your slide rule that you haven’t seen since grade school.    What makes this museum however are the tour guides especially Peter who will tell you everything and it will all finally make sense to you. All the guides here are amazing and most knowledgeable. Allow yourself a full hour at the museum after Bletchley Park and walk five minutes to get here even though you will feel like you are ready to drop dead after spending all day at the park. Trust me if you miss these machines you missed the highlight. (Also don’t ask the lady at Bletchley Park where the museum is located – she repeatedly told me to go the wrong way with certainty and I was too tired to go back and tell her for the future visitors – sorry).    Now I have to say after the museum you will be looking at a good 20 minute hike back to the train station which would’ve been too much for us especially since it started raining! But Peter was getting off work and stepped outside and offered us a ride. Wow talk about British hospitality. I am so impressed with how nice the people in this country are…    After a rest on the train back to the hotel we felt up to going to take a picture at Harry potters 9 3/4 platform which was only one stop away on the underground which we have now mastered. It was a fun ending to the day! We stood in line for 20 min or so and took Harry Potters pictures bought gifts and it was such fun- the photo made us laugh! By this time I particularly liked going up to the Parcel Yard pub just to the right to the right of the shop there in Kings Cross Station. I wasn’t sure I would make it up those stairs after this long day but I did and was rewarded with a very strong cocktail and RD enjoyed a fantastic beer. The surroundings were of traditional English pub In a historical setting and we had their delicious avocado toast. It was good and we felt much better.    Once I could see straight we left for another quick ride back to the hotel amongst the rush-hour crowd which did not bother me one bit this time (especially since I was still tipsy from the drink!) How nice that the British can have a drink at the end of a workday and not have to drive home.    A 24 hour grocery is only two doors down from our hotel so we grabbed some things for the room and I crashed early.    Day 4: Themes River Cruise and Tower of London! Omg I am tired! DH went down for breakfast and i went back to bed with coffee after sleeping 8 hours! OK so this is where I knew I was going to need a morning rest in bed to be able to keep moving… And I was right I always crash on day four or five. As much as I wanted to get to see the crown jewels without waiting in line I just could not get myself out of bed. I miss the days when I could push myself till I literally collapse but now I run the risk of dropping dead so I best not do that.    I really like the location of this hotel! We left the hotel at 10:10 and walked 20 minutes across the Thames River by Big Ben! Oh this was just a wonderful walk and the view of the water and city is gorgeous! Yes I had a skip and a smile on my face! I’m in London!    We took the 10:40 City cruise tour of the Thames river right there at Westminster pier. I had bought tickets before leaving the hotel and just pulled them up on my phone. It was a beautiful day for a cruise on the water and London is amazing! This is a must do here..the crew had good commentary with a lot of humor and we really enjoyed the 40 minutes and disembarked at 11:40 at the Tower pier right there by the Tower of London! We spent the rest of the very relaxing day there— 4 and half hours. And the line was not long at all for the Crown Jewels— maybe 15 minutes but they make it interesting. We went there first( but yes go here first because the line did seem to get longer as the day went on) Afterwards we did the Yeoman tour and then the White Tower. We were ready to get off our feet by the time we reached the nice cafe at 1:00! The food was very good! I am glad we had all day here…3 hours would have been too little and it was so pleasant with so many interesting things to see. We had time to just sit outside then on a bench looking at the Tower Bridge…and the beautiful city of London. Just lovely. My recommendation is not to rush this day or try to crowd too much into the day. We just took the underground back now that we are experts at it:) haha ,Janet K,London,"Houston, Texas"

Hi.    We are wondering which route is best and the most scenic to take en route to Ullapool.  We only have one full day for this drive.  I heard the route via Torridon and Poolewe is much more scenic but longer than the direct one.  Which detour is better if we only take one - to Torridon or Poolewe?  Actually we have 2 options in our minds for that day as I figure we cant do both:  1. Option: make a detour to Bealach na ba viewpoint and then take the direct route to Ullapool.  2. Option: drive to Ullapool through Torridon or/and Poolewe.    Thanks for the feedback! ,Miha Š,Scotland,"Ljubljana, Slovenia"

I have plan an itinerary with the first 4 days on public transport as we arrive early and will wait for our son flying in to join us before we take the car. This is our itinerary and hope you all can help some of my queries.    Scotland itinerary  Part 1: Public transport  18 Sep Arrive at Edinburgh Vist Edinburgh overnight at Edinburgh  19 Sep Edinburgh to Glasgow overnight at Glasgow  20 Sep Glasgow to Loch Lomond overnight at Loch Lomond  21 Sep Loch Lomond and surrounding with public transport2nd overnight at Loch Lomond  ———————————————————————————-  Part 2: Self drive  22 Sep Loch Lomond back to Edinburgh airport to pick up car  Drive to Glencoe and overnight at Glencoe  23 Sep Glencoe to Mallig overnight at Mallig  24 Sep Cross ferry to Armadale and drive to Fairy Pools overnight  at Carbost  25 Sep Drive to Neist lighthouse and trail walk1st overnight at Staffin  26 Sep Quirang walk Rubha Hunish and Duntulm castle Rha waterfalls 2nd overnight at Staffin  27 Sep Kilt Rock The brother’s point Lealt falls Gremiscaig waterfall Man of the Storr 3rd overnight at Staffin  28 Sep Staffin to Loch Ness and 1st overnight at Inverness  29 Sep Cairngorms National Park 2nd overnight at Inverness  30 Sep 3rd overnight at Inverness  1 Oct Inverness to Edinburgh airport    Question 1:  Is it possible to do walks in Trossachs National Park without a car?

Question 3:  The drive from Edinburgh to Glencoe we will take the scenic route M9 A82 A830. Is Staying one night at Glencoe and another night at Mallaig is good choice for efficient travel?

Anywhere else if you all may suggest that I can look at after Inverness that is not too far from Edinburgh.  Thank you very much for your help!  Regards  Leng ,Leng K,Scotland,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi all  Apologies if this is in the wrong place but I just had a few questions about Gatwick specifically the North terminal.    1. I read somewhere that there are some kind of restrictions on pick-ups at the airport. Unfortunately I cannot remember the exact details or the source so I may have just been misinformed. But I wanted to clarify the process for being meet by an Emirates cheffeur as I do have the privilege to be flying on Emirates business.    2. I will be take some anxiety meds - I have my prescription will be taking the box and am getting a letter from my doctor shortly. I was just wanting to know what the process is whether I will need to go through a something to declare lane or similar and how long this process may take.    For the record I am travelling from Australia (with an Australian passport) via Dubai and will be arriving near midday.    Thanks in advance all :) ,Theatrefan24601,London,"Brisbane, Australia"

Hi there    I am meeting my young adult daughter in London just pre Christmas. I haven’s seen her in a year.    She is flying in from Madrid on Iberia Airways and will arrive to terminal 5. I am flying in from Sydney via Tokyo on JAL and arrive at Terminal 4. I am scheduled to arrive just over an hour before her. She won’t have checked in baggage I will. We will then be catching the Heathrow express into London.    I would prefer not to just meet up at the train given I haven’t seen her for a year I would like to meet up at the airport. Are you able to suggest which one of us should go to the other terminal how we would do this and where is best to meet.    I have only been to Heathrow twice in 30 years so have no familiarity with it at all. My daughter has never been there. I do realise that it will be chaotic on 22 December and that flights are highly likely not to run to schedule but let’s just assume all goes smoothly!    Many thanks.

In the interest of milder weather we’re considering an 8-9 day visit at the beginning of summer. What we’re concerned about is the likelihood of crowds during that period. Our focus tends to be away from touristy areas but it would helpful learn if Scotland is not as busy as much of Europe at that time. Many thanks for suggestions. ,LeGenerale,Scotland,Northeast

I'd be grateful if you would please share some input on my preliminary thoughts for a trip to Yorkshire.    First for those who have not seen my previous posts on the England board some background - this will be for two adults (husband & wife) celebrating a 60th birthday with a first trip to England. We have 13 nights total flying through Heathrow - not leaving until 4pm on day 14. We like history nature good food active adventures where we can learn about the people and the culture of a place. We like to see a lot but not go around just checking off the list of top attractions even though we want to see most popular things we also love the lesser known places too and can go from early morning to end of day - but like to stop and smell the roses too (or have an afternoon where we just sit down and relax people watching). We are from USA have been to Europe so we have dealt with major time change difference.    Currently I am planning time in London before traveling to Yorkshire possibly up to 6 nights in the North. We like to do the busy touring at the beginning of our trip and then the more relaxed parts at the end. I know my ancestors came from the North York Moors (as well as other areas in England and Scotland) and although it won't be the only thing we explore I would like to see some of the places they came from. I thought we could break up the Yorkshire days with a few in York itself but also spend a night or two elsewhere. It was suggested I post here to determine best options for that second part - where to stay outside of York.    Towns that I have found I have ties to include - Pickering Scarborough Robin Hoods Bay Silpho Suffield Scalby Hackness East Ayton Ebberston Guisborough Staithes Fylingdales.    Because we like nature and exploring I am definitely considering Cleveland Way. We also love waterfalls and I've been researching to see which ones in the area we may want to visit.    I am in the early stages of planning so welcome any input/advice from those who know this area of England as to suggesting things to do or see that I don't know from my research so far. I am very interested in suggestions on where to stay - including what town and where should I look to book our accommodations in that town (open to hotel bed and breakfast etc.).    I am grateful for any help you might offer. Thank you! ,Sara365_13,Yorkshire,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
Hi want to visit the market December 18th - 20th but centre hotels and parking are very expensive Has anyone any suggestions of places outside the city with free parking and we could catch a train in  There are three adults we’re happy with travelodge family type room  Thanks Carole ,Carole N,Birmingham,
So I have a car and the options are below:      1) drive south to Loch Ness. Not a believer but the castle and Loch itself looks likes it worth visiting. Might go all the way to Fort William if possible.    2) Drive across the North Coast to Elgin and below see how far I get before turning back.    3) Drive to Cairngorms. I wondering if it is possible to do this together with Elgin. Is it possible to drive to Elgin and then south to the Cairngorms.

There's a new vintage bus service for Central London. Route T15 links Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square and the Tower of London.    Fares for all-day use are £7.50 for adults (including seniors) £5 for children and £20 for groups of four. It's not a TfL service so you can't use Oyster cards.

Hello.    On our way to Glencoe today we decided to fill up the tank to full when we came across a fuel station.  We have a fiat 500 and we were down only 2 lines so Im guessing we needed like 20£ worth of gas or less?    When filling up the tank we authorized 80£ on our credit card because we didn’t know how much exactly we needed fully expecting the right amount will be deducted from this authorization like it’s done in our country.    We have now noticed the full 80£ has been deducted from our credit card even though we certainly did not use gas for this amount.    When we filled up our tank the screen was ready for the next costumer and it did not produce any invoice so basically we have nothing but our bank confirmation.    Can you please advise me what happened here because I’m concerned using now any other station or knowing how to use them.  Did I buy 80£ worth of gas I don’t need?  And how is this far one cannot know how much one needs. ,Miha Š,Scotland,"Ljubljana, Slovenia"

Good afternoon  I am coming to Belfast for the first time with my Partner in October for her Birthday  Typical city break really good food pubs live music probably shopping (for her) plus the touristy bits. I can see the Titanic museum is £25 each and have to book a time no issue there we will decide nearer the time what day.  In terms of the tour bus. is this worth it? hop on hop off £20 seems reasonable. how often do they run? if we was to get off on say Shankhill road / Peace walls how long would we be waiting and is it safe round there for a tourist hanging about?.  I know there is an option of a taxi tour but I can imagine for 2 it would be pricy.  Pub wise I have found some decent pubs Fountain Lane Northern whig Deers Head Franklins etc. the latter being good for sport.  Is there any other recommendations? any bars which really stand out for live music (we are there the Thu / Fri and Sat)  Any areas to avoid  Any other hidden gems worth exploring away from the known tourist things to do  We want to make the most of the time there and see everything but also have a good drink and some good food. Cheers all ,Greg2602,Belfast,
I had another thread on this but I've since found a few more options. From the previous post I ruled out one place and kept the other (and will include here again as a point of comparison).    We are looking for 2 or 3 bedroom apartments (for 3 nights over a mid-May weekend) for 3 reasons:    - we are 4 adult women - me (age 55) plus 3 20-somethings. The 20-somethings are prepared to share beds but I am not!  - the 3 young ladies plan to go clubbing late into the night and I am not. I need my own bedroom with a door that can close!  - a kitchen will allow us to have snacks drinks and breakfast at home.    I have narrowed our choices down to the below (for now).

For those who have not seen my previous posts - We are husband/wife (celebrating a 60th birthday) coming to England in September 2024. We like history nature good food active adventures.    So we finally have our flights purchased!!!  Leaving Eastern USA 9:30pm on a Monday arriving in London Heathrow 10:15 am on Tuesday. Then returning to USA 2 weeks later on a Monday (flight leaving Heathrow at 4:00pm - it was more than double the cost to fly out of Manchester so we will return to London on a Sunday for one night).    Now I would greatly appreciate your advice/input on what comes next! I'm debating where to book for our accommodations in both London and York so I come to you wise wonderful people again! Please give me your thoughts based on what I'm bouncing around. At this point I am planning 6 nights in London 5 or 6 in York.    For what I want - I prefer places with character. I don't really want a modern monstrosity - more old world charm but with helpful staff and modern conveniences. I don't need to be in an area where the nightlife is the hottest thing. I would love to be able to easily get out to see the area - near at least one entrance to the Underground in London for example - but walkable to a place to grab a view or a park. I don't have unlimited funds but will probably be using points for at least part of our stay so I don't want a 500 GBP a night room but I'm not thinking it has to be 200 GBP a night either - somewhere in between is more along the lines of what I am thinking.    I have read a LOT of reviews watched dozens of YouTube videos read vlogs read trip reports here etc. It is starting to be overwhelming! I'm seeing more that I want to add to my list of considerations instead of narrowing the list down.    One I liked is The Clermont Victoria. Another I was looking at is The Rembrandt. I also liked the look of the rooms at Rubens at the Palace and Batty Langley's. So quite a variety of locations. What are your thoughts about these places any others that I may just not be thinking of that I need to consider?  Thank you!    York - Should I just go with The Grand and not even consider others? It looks like I should just go with it but am I overlooking a hidden gem?    Then that last night! I am going to travel from York no later than on Sunday but am thinking about leaving York on Saturday and then do something that Sunday/night so that we don't just go to the airport hotel on Sunday and waste our last morning. With hours in the morning before needing to head to the airport I'm considering options still. Any input? I don't know that I should try to make it to Liverpool (had considered that) thought about Windsor or Oxford (so travel on Saturday spend Saturday night sightsee on Sunday and head to the airport on Monday late morning). Again still in the early planning stage and value opinions!    Many thanks for your kind input! I'm so excited but now as I say the real stress has begun! LOL ,Sara365_13,England,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
Hello basically I received my passport a few days ago and signed my passport. I signed my signature on the line however one of my initials within my signature goes slightly below the line and touches the writing (Holders Signature). Has this invalidated my passport because it is only a fraction of an initial which below the line. I'm due to fly to Turkey in three weeks and I'm nervous I cant now.  Anyone else done this and still been able to fly.  Cheers. ,officialmichaael2017,,"Birmingham, United..."
I originally posted this in the Scotland Trip Report thread but thought I might more responses if I started a new subject.    My wife and I are in the early stages of planning a trip to Scotland for our 50th anniversary. We would like to utilize a vacation service to join a guided tour of 7-10 days preferably during August 2025 to be able to include the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. We would fly from Philadelphia and would probably do best to arrive & depart from the same city in Scotland (unless it's simple to do otherwise). We are both in our 70's but relatively active. Any suggestions? Previous experience doing just this? ,John S,Scotland,Kennedyville...
We (2 of us) are heading to the UK next summer (Aug 24). We plan to spend 5 nights in Somerset and hope to see the Cotswolds Stone Henge plus the sites of Somerset from here (Bath Wells Glastonbury Wookey hole etc). We usually like to have at least one nice dinner/lunch at each place we go. Would love some suggestions on where to base ourselves. I was thinking Bath would be nice and have lots of dinner options (plus no driving for the sightseeing in Bath or if we want to have a drink with dinner) but assume it is more expensive and worried about traffic/parking with the car. Are there any other options/suggestions. ,Melted2,,"Sydney, Australia"

I will be doing a nine day Scottish highland walk with a group of friends. I’m a bit worried about some of the 12 mile days and my ability to keep walking.

This topic comes up often in the forum. Now that tickets for my upcoming trip are sorted I thought I would share my advice and experiences.    Always try to buy directly through the club. You know the tickets will be genuine and you can work with the ticket office if there is a problem. Unless your schedule is flexible don't buy tickets until the date and time of the match is fixed usually 6 to 8 weeks out. If all Premier League matches show the same time then TV has not selected their games yet. Buy a home team scarf from a vendor outside the stadium and go as a supporter. Even if you're not. You will otherwise create a problem for yourself annoy the other fans and make all visitors look bad.    You may have to spend money especially when buying Hospitality tickets. Buy the cheapest hospitality level they have. Even with hospitality tickets I never spent more on a ticket than typical face value for a good seat to an NFL game. If you don't the money go to a Championship game they're just as fun.    Arrive 2 to 3 hours before the match and after you buy your scarf find a supporters pub. You'll learn all the supporters songs and favorite chants by the time you leave for the match.    Tottenham vs Newcastle - Sunday Dec 10 2023 (Premier League)  Bought a One Hotspur Membership two years ago. Once tickets open up to One Hotspur members you can go on the website and look for tickets. This match is sold out I was able to buy an official resale ticket for £200.    Sunderland vs West Brom - Saturday Dec 9 2023 (Championship)  Bought two tickets directly from the Sunderland website. No membership required. £80 total for both tickets    Hearts vs Rangers - Wednesday Dec 6 2023 (Scottish Premier League)  Bought two hospitality tickets directly from the club over an email exchange. Match was already sold out.    West Ham vs Arsenal - April 16 2023 (Premier League)  Bought tickets directly from the club on their website. No membership required. West Ham got behind 2-0 and it could have been 3-0 but an Arsenal goal was called off. The Hammers came roaring back to win a tie against the League contenders. London Stadium was bonkers. Great game to experience.    Chelsea vs Brighton - Apr 15 2023 (Premier League)  Bought one hospitality ticket directly from the club. Only used the seat did not participate in the other hospitality perks met some Chelsea supporter friends at a pub before the match. Third straight time I had seen Chelsea lose in person. The should pay me to stay away! :-)    Lyon vs Rennes - Apr 9 2023 (Ligue 1)  Bought tickets directly from the club. Lyon got behind 1-0 and came back for a thunderous 3-1 win. Lyon fans clearly not happy with the direction of the team. Poor attendance. Supporters displayed a banner quite critical of ownership.    West Ham vs Chelsea - Dec 4 2021 (Premier League)  Bought tickets directly from the club on their website. Chelsea was contending for the league at the time and the hammers knocked beat them 3-2. This was the match where I decided I'd raher be next to the field than up high. I now always try to get tickets just off the field.    Fulham vs Bournemouth - Dec 3 2021 (Championship)  Bought a Fulham membership. Then bought two tickets to the match. Sat in the old wooden seats under the overhang at Craven Cottage. That stadium has a really old school feel. Quite a contract after seeing he new Tottenham stadium. Fulham and Bournemouth were the top two teams in the Championship and the unusual Friday night match was electric. Fulham got a late goal to earn the tie.    Tottenham vs Brentford - Dec 2 2021 (Premier League)  Bought a Hotspur One membership and then bought a ticket to the match. The membership was about £80 and I don't think it expires. The stadium was the real show here. It is as over the top as they said it would be. Visited the brewery inside the stadium. Close up viw of Son scoring to seal the 2-0 win for Tottenham.    Manchester United vs LASK - March 2020 (Europa League)  Bought tickets directly from the team website. No membership. The game was not played due to Covid we had the head back home early. Another trick to see Premier League teams play is to buy tickets to the Europa League or even Champions League matches. They are midweek games and not as likely to sell out.    Chelsea vs Bournemouth - Dec 14 2019 (Premier League)  Bought hospitality tickets directly from the club. Took my daughter to her first match. Enjoyed a terrific pre-game buffet free drinks and interview with some Chelsea greats.    Arsenal vs Bournemouth - Oct 6 2019 (Premier League)  Bought tickets on Stubhub. Barcode was scanned a the entrance no problem. I would not suggest this unless there is no other solution Stubhub says they have a money back guarantee if it doesn't work. This was a rare sunny day in London. Arsenal fans were dead. Emirates Stadium is overrated.    Liverpool vs Leicester City - Oct 5 2019 (Premier League)  Bought hospitality tickets directly from the club. Great lunch buffet and even better seats. THis was the year Liverpool won the title. They won the match on a late James Milner penalty. Anfield is easily the loudest and most intimidating stadium I've ever been in.    West Ham vs Swansea - Dec 7 2014 (Premier League)  Bought a ticket directly from the club. Was in the old Boleyn Ground stadium. The great Andy Carroll had a brace (2 goals) and the Hammers won. Glad I had a chance to see this old stadium. I felt I was in the 1970s there.    Metz vs Red Star - Dec 1 2015 (Ligue 1)  Bought a ticket from the ticket office the day before the match. This is the only stadium where they have checked IDs to make sure they matched the ticket before you could get in.    Stuttgart vs Augsburg - Nov 23 2015 (Bundesliga)  Bought a ticket from the team website. Tons of families. Big stadium. Lots of flags in the supporters section. ,Paul F,London,"Palm Coast, Florida"

We have two days in Edinburgh before leaving for Milngavie to walk the WHW. We are aviation enthusiasts and are considering renting a car and driving from Edinburgh to the National Museum of Flight in East Fortune on day 2. We would leave early to be at the museum when it opens. After a few hours there we would make our way slowly back to Milngavie stopping along the way wherever seems of interest .    I'm looking for recommendations of a route back to Milngavie in the afternoon avoiding Edinburgh's city center if possible. We're open to any place that might be a nice town to stop for lunch or afternoon tea or pint maybe someplace of historical interest. We like to walk but as we're doing the WHW don't want any major mileage before we start. We're open to anything and suggestions would be most appreciated! ,FarAway793853,Edinburgh,
For the benefit of anyone planning to arrive ator leave from Edinburgh Airport in the evening or early morning:    Between 19:00 on Friday 27 October and 07:00 on Sunday 12 November there will be no tram service between Haymarket and Newhaven including to and from the city centre. This only affect services between 19:00 and 07:00; services in the rest of the day will run as normal.    Services to and from Haymarket Edinburgh Park and Edinburgh Gateway will run as normal so you will be able to connect with trains from those stations.    If you are heading to Princes Street or St Andrew Square you can take the Airlink 100 from the airport which runs at a similar frequency to the trams and has a similar journey time (and is a couple of pounds cheaper).    Alternatively you can take the tram as normal to Haymarket and change onto a Lothian bus for the rest of the journey. The buses will accept your tram ticket for the comparable journey. ,Mike L,Edinburgh,"Edinburgh, United..."

Where would you choose to be your “home base”?    If it makes a difference—we have two kids (ages 10 and 12) and would be staying for a month in July. We love scenic walks being able to walk to shops/grocery stores/restaurants and taking day trips (ideally by train/bus though we can hire a car if necessary).    But if there is someplace you especially love I would be interested to hear about it even if it meets none of those criteria. ,JWalterWeatherman,Cornwall,"Washington, DC"

At 27th June currently Starspeed/Penzance Helicopters are cancelling flights to/from Penzance/Scilly day by day. Having transferred me to the ferry at short notice last week they promised me that flights would be resumed by Tuesday 27th June. They are not flying.  The back-up helicopter promised for this service doesn't exist and all their customers are being let down.  If they were to let customers know in good time so that they could cancel the non-existent flights and book their own passage on the ferry then Starspeed would have to give everybody their money back because they can't provide the service promised.  However if they get customers to turn up then as long as they have got them to StMary's /Tresco even if strapped to the back of a dolphin they have legally fulfilled their terms and conditions and Hey Presto we have all paid £150 for no service.  Does anybody know when the Starspeed/Penzance Helicopter service is to be resumed?  Their last update on their website was 23rd June.. They are currently accepting bookings on their website from 4th July. Earlier today they were selling flights from 1st July. Does this mean they are knowingly really selling flights with no aircraft?  At 7 flights per day of 7/8 passengers means 50 passengers a day could be being charged for no available service. Any suggestions how this might be resolved? ,Richard J,Isles of Scilly,"Sheffield, United..."

I'm at the very beginning of planning so bear with me!    I'm looking at a slow circular trip around Scotland around Feb/Mar 2024. My very early plans are these:    Train from home to Glasgow    West Highland line to Fort William (poss overnight stop/s along the way)    Bus to Kyle of Lochalsh (as far as I can see there isn't a train linking these places)    Train to Inverness (overnight stop along the way)    Inverness to either Glasgow or Edinburgh (again an overnight stop along the route)    I came up with this idea by chance whilst looking at a Google map of Scotland and by following the train lines from place to place...I'm hoping I haven't just imagined that these all connect together.    I've had a quick gander on the Trainline app and it does seem to pan out.    My questions therefore are:    Is this actually do-able?    What's the likelihood of weather stopping the trains running in Feb/March?    Do the trains usually run all through the year? (I tried a quick look on a Google search on timetables but I couldn't search far enough ahead and I know that train timetables only work 12 weeks on advance)    Any help or tips would be much appreciated. ,Walk-ng barefoot,Scotland,North West England...

Regulars often mention staying within the Circle Line as close to a tube station as you can afford. I agree with that but offer this advice to tourists - map out your daily itinerary on Google Maps before booking your accommodation. I say this because I'm about to go to London for another week in March and I'm staying on the Albert Embankment with the closest tube stop an 11 minute walk (Vauxhall). A lot of my itinerary involves buses and transfers with travel times as much as 35 minutes. My first trip to London I stayed a 5 minute walk to Victoria Station and on my second trip I stayed a 3 minute walk to South Kensington Station. I was spoiled for transit then so my points are location location location and time is money...or as some of the TALF members say - it's a false economy. ,DaytonJG,London,"Centerville, Ohio"
We will be traveling by car around Scotland in May. Towards the end of our trip we will be in Glencoe/Glen Etive before heading to Stirling and down to Glasgow. On the way I would like to stop by a loch (or two) where we can either walk hike or bike in beautiful surroundings. I read there is a good view of Loch Awe from KIlchurn Castle a nice scenic hike up to it from unmarked parking lot on A85. I also read to rent a bike and from the pier on Loch Katrine there's a boat to Stronachlachar on the western shore from where you can follow by bike beautiful B829 via Loch Ard back to Arberfoyle. Any thoughts on these suggestions or others are welcome. Also is Loch Lomond a must? Would you recommend the eastern shore? We will probably stop in Stirling before Glasgow. ,Bronna L,Scotland,"New York City, New..."
Most hostels and hotels are looking for 18 year old bookings however I am seeing some of them are “youth hostels” and was wondering how these work what they are called and the price etc etc.  Would our trip that we are planning to go ahead with even be possible as I am seeing the app does not allow for ‘children’ to be going to stay by themselves without an adult booking it for them and being with them.    All in all I am asking if and how we can plan a budget (as cheap as possible since we are students)1 night trip for 9 16 year olds this December since I am unable to find a suitable hostel/hotel allowing us to do so and do not know where to begin.

Hi all    Will be arriving by train to MAN T2 after 22:30hrs. My flight is at 06:00 the next morning. Traveling with hand language only and will have mobile boarding pass so no need to wait for physical check in around 04:00.    If I arrive after 22:30 can I go through the security and stay airside until my early morning flight and find a quite corner there to have rest?

Hi.    I'm considering the safety of these two situations as a woman travelling solo in London.    I could travel to London Kings Cross and arrive at about 19:00 to get the train to LHR followed by a short bus ride at around 20:40 to get to an airport hotel.    This journey would save me £30 as opposed to if I travelled earlier in the day. Saving this money would be really helpful to me.    However it would be in December and I worry about it getting dark and the risk of potentially dangerous situations increasing as it is later on in the day.    If anyone could provide any advice on the risk level then that would be great.    Also any resources/tips on keeping safe when travelling in London would be much appreciated.    Thanks. ,Mia,London,"Durham, United..."
Hi  I will be visiting London along with my wife during Christmas and New Year’s. We will be staying at a relative’s house in Gravesend Kent. Being tourists we will be coming into London everyday for an entire week from 24 December to 31 December. I looked up for the cheapest ways to travel but could’nt find anything of help to me. From my understanding (correct me if I am wrong) the area I will be staying at is outside the scope of oyster card travels and I will have to take national rail evertytime I travel which will be very costly. Please advise how to go about with my travels.    Thanks ,Atif Mansoor,London,

My wife & I are traveling to the Cotswold’s & Stratford upon Avon. I would like your advice on where we must stay at this time of the year?  We haven’t yet decided on a rental car but we hope to hit as many villages and explore the towns. So that’s an option.    We enjoy pubs drinks & dinners with music in the evenings if any would be great at these villages.    We are there from Dec 7-10.    If your advice is to not be visiting these towns / villages in the winter we may spend these 4 days in Edinburgh instead.    Thank you for your advice.

I'd be grateful if you would please share some input on my preliminary thoughts for a week in London.    First some background - this will be for two adults (husband & wife) celebrating a 60th birthday with a first trip to England. We like history nature good food active adventures where we can learn about the people and the culture of a place. We like to see a lot but not go around just checking off the list of top attractions even though we want to see most popular things we also love the lesser known places too and can go from early morning to end of day - but like to stop and smell the roses too (or have an afternoon where we just sit down and relax people watching). We are from USA have been to Europe so we have dealt with major time change difference.    If we are spending 6 nights in London I would want at least 3 days to be at least partly organized possibly 4 days with tour plans to include a day trip outside of London.    Our arrival will most likely be mid-morning (based on the outgoing flights I'm currently considering) probably arriving in London on a Tuesday. So by the time we get to the city drop off our luggage etc. that might be getting close to lunch time. In case of delays I don't know if we should plan anything with reservations that day so if you have a suggestion on our best way to spend that first day feel free to give input! So far I had thought of things like getting on a Hop On Hop Off bus just to get a tour around although I know it will be slow going or possibly visiting a Market like Covent Garden or Spitalfields or maybe taking a River Cruise to Greenwich.    The next morning (our first full day) I would like to plan a fuller day of touring. I don't think we will want to do everything in one day but maybe Westminster Abbey in the morning wander around and see the Changing of the Guard see the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace and then maybe add something off the beaten track/walking tour also.    Maybe then for the next day (second full day) we would be able to visit the Tower of London and St. Paul's both. I'd welcome your suggestions on where you recommend we plan for an afternoon tea for that day.    Then on day three plan for a day trip. My husband really feels we should see Stonehenge. Since he doesn't say too many things he feels are musts I'd like to discuss the best way to do this. I've seen/read some group tour trips and I definitely don't want to do it the way they do it! LOL. I know that some of them stop at Windsor on the way - so would it be better to just get out to Stonehenge as early as possible and then go up to stop at Oxford on the way back? Possibly add in Windsor on the way back to London. Does that sound terribly out of the way or way too much for one day? I'm thinking that maybe we could plan lunch or tea in Oxford? What type of things would you include on a trip to Oxford? How many hours would you suggest we would want to spend there? I'm thinking Stonehenge itself is not a long stop - am I missing something or do you think it is a shorter stop and that the drive out is where more of the time is used?    For our fourth day I am thinking it would be a quieter day but possibly go to the theatre that evening (this would possibly be a Saturday). Definitely welcome your suggestions though. I've considered going to Les Mis - because well Les Mis in London! But if you have a suggestion for something that is more of a must do I am very interested in your input!    Then on our fifth day maybe do a tour or actual City of London exploration and/or the Greenwich or Spitalfields that we didn't do on our first half day. If it is a Sunday I definitely want to do Sunday Roast somewhere! Again I welcome your suggestions! Also would going to Greenwich work best on Sunday or would that actually be a bad day to visit there?    We would then look at moving on to our next location on full day 6.    These are just thoughts and I am very open to suggestions/advice. As soon as the dates are released for flights we are going to get them so hopefully in the next week or so we are set. I am also debating where we will stay in London.    If you have any favorites to recommend I am open to hearing your thoughts. I've considered smaller lodgings - Batty Langley's The Grazing Goat etc.    Thanks so much for any input/advice! ,Sara365_13,London,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

Hi are there any park and ride services going into Bristol (ideally to temple meads) where you can leave your car overnight? We are coming from the North East if that makes any difference.

My husband and his friend were just notified that they received an Advanced Tee Time for June 2024! We did not expect this and I'm not sure how to begin to plan this trip. There are 2 couples (wives don't play golf) traveling from the US. I'd appreciate any help with logistics - where to stay (is Airbnb a possibility?) do we need a rental car best way to ship clubs etc. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated - we are excited and overwhelmed!!    We will also add on to this trip - probably 10 days and we've never been to the UK and want to see as much as possible. Any suggestions?  Thank you! ,Bearvet,Scotland,MA
London has been on my bucket list and I’m finally planning my first trip! My husband and I are planning to come next year for New Years Eve 2024. I know there are several options to see the fireworks and I think to avoid the crowds we’ve chosen to do either a boat cruise or one of the dinner/dancing parties. We don’t really care about the dancing but I haven’t seen just a dinner option. That being said which is the better option to get the best view? If it’s the boat tour which is the best one? And what time of year do these open up to get reservations? Thanks! ,KentuckyRaven,London,"Richmond, Kentucky"

Hello we will be arriving at Gatwick next month and renting a car and spending a few days in East Sussex. What would be the best way to get to London by train? We were planning to return the rental car to Gatwick and then take the Gatwick Express to London. Or is there a better alternative like returning the car to a town like Brighton and taking a train from there. From what I can ascertain that train would stop at Gatwick before going to London. That doesn’t seem to save much time but going back to the airport seems like it would take longer. We will be staying in the Farringdon area in London. Any suggestions welcome. ,roross,East Sussex,"New York City, New..."
Hi Everyone!  We are heading to London in February with nonrefundable expiring in Feb '24 plane tickets. It's a long story. We know it is cold in London then but we have never been to England and are not beach people so heading south for warmer weather (especially since we live in hot Atlanta Georgia) just to use plane tickets would not be satisfying. So off to 40 degree possibly rainy/possibly sunny but nonetheless beautiful London! And we are so excited! Plus I visit New England in the winter to visit family so I am used to cold weather; however I am usually indoors for my visits. 😉  Here's the question: since it will be cold at that time of the year should we stay closer to City Centre e.g. Covent Garden or Soho so not dealing with the weather as we travel during the day? Or would an outer neighborhood like Hyde Park still be a great option. We know you can get just about anywhere on the Tube but we were wondering if walking and the weather will be something we need to consider when thinking of staying farther out just to save a few pounds/dollars.  We are excited about our trip and seeing London in the off-season. We just want to make sure that an outer borough might not be too adventurous when considering the weather.  Oh we are in our 50's and we don't drink anymore (lol) so while we want to be part of the nightlife we don't need to stay in the heart of it to have fun but we will to cut down on walking a lot.  I think I just convinced myself to stay in the heart of it all but I really like the hotel deal I secured in Hyde Park. Plus it is really pretty there. See... totally confused! 😄  Thanks for the help! ,Stacy M,London,"Atlanta, Georgia"
Clearly looking at various reviews for the car park at Fistral Beach I am not the first to be 'conned' by these 'thieves'. Newquay Council should be ashamed of themselves for contracting out to such a bunch of crooks.    Overstayed mistakingly by a very short amount of time (made worse by the fees being odd amounts). This was the first free weekend after lockdown which we had imposed a period of self isolation on health grounds. Pointless appealing but I hope the free wine the councillers receive from this mob chokes them!    Beware of the fact that the ANPR registers as soon as you drive in not from the time of ticket purchase. My advice is head to Devons beaches they're far better. ,Danny W,Newquay,"Lifton, United..."
After a 2 1/2 hour delay out if Chicago we landed at LHR and jumped on the Elizabeth line to Reading to catch a train to Moreton-in-Marsh (always buy the flexible ticket as you never know) where we then caught the bus to Bourton-on-the-Water arriving at 4pm. Transportation was very easy to figure out. The buses really ran on perfect schedules while we were there. Checked into the Chester house hotel for a 4 night stay and had made 6pm reservations at L'Antara in the hotel for simplicity after all that travel  Dinner was just okay but the room and hotel bar are great. Wife went to bed and I took a stroll and grabbed a pint.  Bourton takes many slings and arrows on here but it truly is a postcard perfect town. Days were more crowded but not maddeningly so. Maybe it was the difference of early September visit or being there on a Tuesday to start our 4 nights I'm not really sure.  It was REALLY hot the whole time we were there so didn't get as much wandering in as I had hoped. We took the bus to Stow-on-the-Wold the next day and poked about for the afternoon and had a 5 30 reservation at Porch House--- historical and great food. Last bus leaves back to Bourton-on-the-Water at 8pm which was later than I expected. Strolled the town stopped for ice cream and more pints that evening .  The 3rd day we headed off to the Slaughters. There's a quick direct path there that's about a tick shy of 2 miles. We explored Upper and Lower looking at the amazing homes and had lunch at the hotel in lower Slaughter. Using my new OS map we took a different route back to Bourton-on-the-Water which totaled out to 8 miles there and back upon return. The OS maps are simply incredible. The precise detail is truly amazing making it an invaluable tool for any hiker.A great walk back with wild blackberries to nibble on everywhere I seemed to look.Sadly the intense heat and walking through vast open fields took its toll on the Mrs and after getting back around 7pm we thought we could rest for a bit and grab burgers at the Smith Brothers but they stopped serving dinner at 9 ---don't believe the website that says 10 30. Wound up just eating snacks on hand that night but beer will fill ya up in a pinch too!  Wife had zero interest in hiking out anywhere the following day our last so we just poked around the towns shops  stopping for a pint here and there and people watching.  There are 4 pubs in town and I hit all of them. The Wellington feeling the most local flavor. We ate in time at the Smith brothers place that night it was a good burger and they make great creative cocktails. Bus to Cheltenham Spa early Saturday and hopped the train to York.  Oh the rumored demise of cash on here is greatly exaggerated! We played cash for everything but the hotel and tapping on buses. I'd say I saw 60% of locals paying cash at pubs and stores. I prefer it as other countries cash is cool and you can only lose it or have it stolen. So much more can go wrong with cards as anyone who has ever experienced cc fraud can tell you. Much easier to budget too...  And we encountered 2 of the pubs in town that were only taking cash due to technical difficulties so I'd say--- yeah bring some cash. We brought 400£  and had no problem using it in the cotswolds and York after. We were almost out of cash by the time we got to our last 4 nights in London so used cards there mostly--- although our London Walks guide had cc machine troubles and was relieved that our group was able to scratch up enough cash for the fe---- still good to carry some cash.  Again Bourton-on-the-Water is a fine place to base yourself. The buses ran like clockwork  seem to run frequently enough to a variety of places and an OS map is your friend. I'd probably hop a bus to a destination and then walk back. Hope I make it back someday to get more use out of my cool map-- and hope it's not so hot!    One funny thing overheard in a shop--- a shopkeeper talking to an older local woman describing the clientele as  oh you know like always... it's the newlywed and the nearly dead    Thanks to penmere and andmar for great advice and all the good questions from others answered on here. A great blog that was a huge help was https://explorethecotswolds.com/cotswolds-by-public-transport/  It's by Lucy Dodsworth if the link didn't work.

Hi All    Will be over in London for a few days in two weeks and am staying in Earls Court. Would be interested in going to the aforementioned match which is on the Mon night. What would be best way to get tickets? Wouldn't mind getting premium or hospitality tickets if the option was there. Could tickets be got earlier in the day at the stadium?    Also - I'd love to get to Hsckney to see one or two spots from 'Top Boy' Netflix series. Are they very far from one another? I do know Tottenham is north west London and Hackney is north east.

Hi All    I have just booked return flights from Edinburgh to Sumburgh I arrive on a Monday in early October and I will have 11 nights and pretty much 11 full days. Prior to this I will have spent a little time in Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as 17 daysin the Outer Hebrides (mostly solo hiking and camping the The Hebridean Way with my backpack). I have been going round in ever decreasing circles trying to create an itinerary for Shetland and am requesting input.    A bit about me- fit 58 year old Australian female. I am a very keen traveller and hiker do lots of solo multiday hiking regular day hiking walking kayaking (although not at the moment). I am a nurse (we have very good annual leave entitlements hence a long trip to Scotland this year). I also like to read am interested in local culture have a very sweet tooth (like food in general really) enjoy nature enjoy my own company but am reasonably outgoing (especially when on holiday) don't mind long drives and get incredibly seasick. I have a family none of whom are in the least bit interested in my kind of travel. That's me in a nutshell.    I was initially thinking of 1-2 nights Sumburgh location (lighthouse coast hike Ness of Birgh Jarlshof Tombolo St Ninians) - My splurge would be a stay at the lighthouse keepers cottage (however it looks as though there is a 3 night minimum stay) then bus to Lerwick for 2 nights plus ?? 1 night Bressay. I would then get a hire car for 7 days (trying to save ££££££ by not getting it for entire 11 days). My quotes for hire car are £400 ish for 7 days. Or just bus straight to a Lerwick accom and put the Sumburgh stuff at the end?    I am super keen to spend a couple of nights in Out Skerrie (I know there is a ferry from Lerwick as well as Vidlin) also very keen for a couple of nights in Unst close to Herma Ness (Gardiesfauld Hostel looks budget friendly) and then infilling with the places/islands in between. I will take my tent/hiking gear and hope to utilise campgrounds as well as other accommodation styles.    I have no clue on the best way to pull it together to give me the most efficient 11 day itinerary The hire car company said they have 3 locations for the car pick up/drop off which I can mix and match. Would love some input.    Many thanks ,gillg,Shetland Islands,"Perth, Australia"

I have also posted this as a reply to myself in a thread where I was seeking advice- apologies if you're seeing it twice.    Transport to Shetland  Great flight with LoganAir from Edinburgh with lovely views of the island (return airfares not cheap but time efficient and great for a motion sickness sufferer - GBP 455 for return ticket)    Days 1-3  Hopped on the local bus - bus stop directly opposite the terminal at Sumburgh- paywave accepted. Pleasant next hour or so on a sunny mini island tour. On this route you actually drive over the runway to head north and then up and down little streets and closes picking up and dropping the locals (3 of us got on at the airport). Multiple stops in Lerwick. The Zee transport app was invaluable for bus and ferry schedules.    2 nights pre-booked at Carradale and Solheim Guesthouse. Very good rate via their website. The Islesburgh Hostel was my first choice but was really expensive as a single- only dorms were available and were blocked out for individual use bookings so i would have to pay for the entire bunk room- GBP 120/n I think this is a leftover thing from COVID measures- probably should have rung them to check but I got a single at Carradale for GBP 42.50/n inc breakfast and it was fantastic.    Spend the afternoon on a walking circuit of the harbour town and surrounds. Some dramatic coastline a big old cemetery a large Iron Age broch- Clickimin Broch and the waterfront inc the Lodberries harbour fort etc  Did a Tesco run for new food supplies. Managed a wander around the shops - the charity shops were fun some great murals and urban art works in Lerwick.  Next day is at the arts centre (couple of art displays that I enjoyed) and museum- excellent representation of the history and social history of the Shetlands. There was also a nice display in the foyer of knitting. Paid a visit the visitors centre to try and plan out a rough itinerary for when I get back from Foula. Good little gift shop and solid advice plus maps. Took a late afternoon visit to the island of Bressay. Caught the ferry over and set out to hike the lighthouse circuit. Sensational cliffs - a really worthwhile hike.  Eating Places- Isleburgh Community Centre (lunch ok) Coffee Culture (really nice) and Petes Coffee (good coffee expensive for a tiny slice of cake) The Dowry (nice vibe and winelist enjoyed the food) Fjara (fantastic food and views).    Days 3-6  Foula  Bus from Viking Bus Station to Tingwall Airport is an ‘on request’ service - this turns out to be a taxi but at a local bus price cash is easier but paywave fine too  Airtask plane from Tingwall airport to the island. I paid GBP 106 for the return flight I had pre-booked it but you pay virtually as you get on the plane. The flight times are scheduled but are very weather dependent. You need to be flexible. The flight takes about 12 minutes flying at 200m above the ocean- very exhilarating!    I’m staying in a ‘studio’ called Ristie Foula owned by Kenny and Mai Gear the studio is attached to a larger rental house. Perfect for me. I brought food (plus extra in case of delays/cancellations) as well as having 2 days catered. It was a very good arrangement.  Mind blown on my preliminary explore. I could not believe my eyes- it is immensely rugged immensely beautiful wow! Da Stack (major landmark) is directly in front of Ristie and there are seals! And sheep. Then there’s the birds!!! Millions of them on the towering cliffs.    My day 2 plan is the circumnavigation of the island including all 3 peaks-Da Kame Da Sneug and Da Noup. Encountered ‘da’ Shetland ponies (Foula variety). Beautiful. Iconic! Velvety lips. Now onto the physical stuff! Da Kame is the second highest seacliff in the UKit’s my first climb for the day. Somewhat steep. Pretty awesome views. As I summit Da Sneug and reach the trig point the cloud bolts in obscuring all views but lifts just as quickly. Nice spot for some coffee and lunch (with sheep). Even bigger views around the island. The descent is a bit trickier as I go WAY off course. Where were those deadly people sucking bogs? This area is called DaDaal it’s a long downward slog especially off track. Effort rewarded- an amazing feature here is Da Sneck Ida Smaalie - a narrow and very deep rock cleft formed by a landslide. It splits the cliffs almost to their base.Next- the coast rises dramatically to the peak of Da Noup to the south.Slowly slowly get up to the top. Prime puffin territory. In season… they flew last month. I do get about 20 seals though at the pier. Bypass the airport visit the church pass through the main town of 3 houses sort of avoid the bogs in the sheep paddocks then a big push along the coastline to finish before dark. A 9 hour day with many detourss covering 26km. Superb day.  Day 3- Storm hits in the night. Massively windy. Difficult to even open the front door! It’s actually an enjoyable day being confined to barracks- my first rest day of the Scotland trip really having hiked The Hebridean Way before Shetland. Late afternoon the wind drops (a bit) 2 birdwatchers next door knock on my window to see if I want to come out - they’re driving to the airstrip which means I can knock off the last little triangle of the island and enjoy the seas massive swell. Fantastic last full day.    Magically the wind dies in the night. Devastated - looks like the flight back to the mainland will go (I was keen for a delay). It does… after the time changes 3 times. Luckily I packed first thing before a final walk because as I’m heading back down to the studio Mai is waving her arms wildly- da plane da plane…(sorry couldn’t help it). Today I’m the only passenger. Mission accomplished- Foula disappears and Tingwall reappears … the journey continues.  AMAZING AMAZINGAMAZING.  LIFE HIGHLIGHT.  Addit- it’s pronounced FOOOOOOLA    Days 6-12  From Tingwall local bus (taxi) drops me at Bolts car Hire. I had been in touch directly with Sinclairs Taxis for the times as it was a Saturday (they act for the bus company and are open 7 days/week).    Car hire was arranged pre-departure with Bolts- I can't praise them highly enough. Impeccable service very very easy. 10/10 I got an automatic transmission Group A and it was GBP 360 fully insured VAT collision waiver etc etc. The price was consistent with other agencies in Shetland.    Night 6- I ended up using a wigwam at Braewick Caravan Park and Cafe that night- hiked out at Eshaness Cliff Circuit- stunning. Did a beach walk down at the little beach near Braewick.    Night7- Ended up at the Gardiesfauld Hostel GBP 23/n  Drove to the ferry terminal for Yell and got on easily without pre-booking. Drove across Yell to get on the ferry to Unst. Didn't get on next ferry so had to wait for a couple of hours so drove to Breckon Sands Beach and had a wander. Drove back to ferry terminal and got on easily. The hostel was only a 10 minute drive from the ferry.  Hostel had 7 others staying- eclectic group. Very well provisioned kitchen and dining area. Bunk room to myself. Quick drive to the Final Checkout - shop/cafe/fuel station. Late afternoon walk of harbour/beach/streets/lake  Next day was my big want to do one - Hermaness NP. It was fantastic. The weather was excellent for most of it- sunny and windy. Hiked the long circuit and just loved it. Thousands of gannets. Great boardwalks and a really enjoyable experience. The afternoon brought a bit of rain but insignificant amounts. Took in the Viking Long House redevelopment as well as one of the Viking longhouse sites at Hamar. Popped into Bobby's Bus Shelter also the most northerly church and the most northerly post office. The weather deteriorated further out at Munness Castle (awesome picnic spot if the weather was dry).    Night 9- stayed at Quam BNB GBP55 and dinner GBP20  Stormy gale force winds saw the ferry schedule on 1 boat from Unst to Yell. I really wanted to go to Victorias tearooms so drove and waited there for the 1000 opening- Victoria and a sign appeared at the front door at 1000 - she wasn't opening due to staff shorthage. Hightailed back to the ferry- it was a first in best dressed arrangement I arrived just as one departed so waited there for nearly 2 hours till the next one- upside- I was first in the queue.  On Yell I decided to go otter spotting so did a rather wild loch/beach walk then a visit out to the haunted castle- Windhouse. Went out to West Sandwick beach after that and did quite a lovely stormy beach walk complete with seals and ponies.  The Quam Bnb was really great. My treat to myself - getting a good hot shower and bed after a few days of hostels and campgrounds. Recommended. Dinner was excellent too.    Night 10- Back to Braewick Campground for another wigwam night. Managed to get the Yell Ferry after a maybe 50 minute wait- once again a reduced ferry timetable- no bookings just line up. Without a definitive plan and stormy day I spent a fair bit of time driving around all the little hamlets of the east coast before driving up to the Hams of Roe hiking trail. I started but turned back just over half way into the trail- the high winds made it foolhardy for a lone hiker (and noone knowing where i was). Still a good experience.  Very late lunch/early dinner at Frankies Fish and Chips - it actually was the best fish I had or the trip. Blew back into Braewick after 5pm and spent the night captive in the wigwam- it was almost impossible to open the door against the wind! I actually love these massively stormy and windy elements.    Night 11 - the night was back at Carradale and Solheim Guesthouse (booked single but was upgraded to a queen ensuite in Solheim).  The day unfolded in calm conditions! Virtually no wind. Drove to Scalloway- the castle is under repairs and VC closed for the season. Took a quick castal walk at a random layby stop on the way to Howick and then called into the Mousa Ferry area for a walk and look through their little display. Ready for a coffee by now! Howick VC was closed for a week (devastated!! My quest for cake has not been overly successful this week). Drank my own instant coffee in their very pleasant little picnic area. From here onto St Ninians tombola beach- the long hike was really enjoyable with stunning ocean and sea cliff views. It took me a couple of hours. Ate in the car in the rain. Drove down to Sumburgh and spent the rest of the afternoon on the lighthouse trail and a quick duck into Jarlshoff before getting back to Solheim.  Celebrated my last night at Fjara Restaurant back down at the waterfront.  Uneventful car drop off and fllight te next morning...    Brilliant 12 days. Glad I was there off season in that there weren't many people around and it was easy to get accommodation/transport. Down side is a few things were shut but I knew that would be the case.  Thanks to those who offered advice along the way. ,gillg,Shetland Islands,"Perth, Australia"

Cruise ship stops there May 28. The excursions are expensive and hours in bus. Is it worth just walking around Kirkwall? Is there much to see. Don't care about museums; more interested in just seeing nature parks etc. Should we do excursion to get out of Kirkwall (drive by Ring of Brodgar) or walk around Kirkwall for the day. Most stops will be excursions with long bus rides and think we would love to find a place when we get off ship where we can explore on our own. Thank you in advance. ,jurynaples25,Kirkwall,"naples, FL"
Hi  My wife's birthday is next month and we will be in London and I want to take her for afternoon tea and theatre.    But most of the afternoon tea places are quite expensive.  Is there a way to get discounts or coupons to reduce price a bit? any apps or websites which offer discounts?  anything around 20 £ would be good below better.  But all the good places i found are above 30  50 £.    Same for theatre.    Thanks ,scoder,London,"Stockholm, Sweden"
My adult daughter (dd) and I recently got back from a wonderful trip to London. We were there ten days from Tuesday Sept 12-Thursday Sept 21 2023. Our trip was a realization finally of one that got cancelled back in 2020 so while we tried to keep to a budget we didn’t try to be too frugal either. And I think our natural hesitation to spend a lot kicked in several times too which wasn’t always a bad thing. For those who like to note we walked at least 18k steps each day. And our feet knew it each night too. Good shoes are a must!    I received some great advice here after continuously asking questions (to the point of being quite a bother I’m sure) and wanted to pay it forward by leaving a trip report in the hope it would help others plan their trips as well. Fair warning I love reading long trip reports with lots of details and have tried to return the favor (a novel neatly laid out in day-to-day format. Lol) so if that bothers you please feel free to stop reading now.    And if you’re interested in seeing how our plans progressed from my first posted itinerary back in March to now you can check out this link first:    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k14325623-o10-Yet_another_itinerary_critique_please-London_England.html ,scraphappylady,London,Philadelphia...
After 3 months away and 10 weeks in the UK as a part of our 50th Anniversary Holiday I thought I should give my observations of our trip. We are both in our 70’s and quite fit.    We stayed in an Airbnb in Clapham Junction a stones throw away from multiple forms of public transport and within a few minutes walk of shops and restaurants. It was a great location and flat. I won’t bore everyone with a day to day account of our adventures but I would like to make some observations that may help others in the future. Please accept that these observations are from a couple of Australians in their 70’s and may not reflect the views of others from other countries.    1. Using London public transport is a must. It’s cheap easy to navigate using Google Maps or City Mapper and will get you to almost anywhere. We loved the buses because of their frequency and the ability to see London Boroughs that we would not have using the tube. We used Visitor Oyster Cards and found them to be perfect for us.  2. We travelled outside of London 23 times using a Brit Rail Pass during our holiday and I can honestly say it was the best investment we made. It easily pays for itself in no time and gives visitors the flexibility of travelling when they want to and that was very handy given the rail strikes we encountered during our stay.  3. As we live in Tropical North Queensland we found the Summer temperatures in July to be quite cool for us. As I remarked to our Host (Landlord) “It was warmer back home in our Winter than it was in London in your Summer”. BUT weather is no reason to complain; just make sure you pack some clothes you can layer on the cooler days.  4. The UK is truly cosmopolitan and you can hear many different languages see and try many different types of food and learn that in this day and age “Sorry” is the most used word in the English language. We lost count of the times people on phones or listening to something on their ear pods would walk right through you and inevitably say “Sorry”.    We truly enjoyed our time in the UK chasing quite a deal of the tourist things but we also spent a lot of our time chasing History that related to our home country. This forum gave us many ideas and solutions to a number of our questions but it’s also fair to say that this forum also has solutions that simply didn’t apply to us. As I already said the Visitor Oyster card was a big part of our travels and I can’t accept the reasoning that you shouldn’t buy one before travel because you’ll pay for a card that you can’t get a refund back or that it’s cheaper to use contactless cards which in our case would have cost us far more in transaction fees than the cost of the card. We arrived in London with a card that would have enabled us to travel on public transport from Day1. We also couldn’t accept criticism of the Brit Rail Pass by those who are unable to use it in their own country. It was great for us.    Finally this was the very best holiday we’ve ever taken and we’re so glad we did. The people we met were so kind and helpful. The food was always interesting and we learnt that London is really crowded on a Sunday. Now if we win Lotto soon we can always come back suitably clothed for a UK Winter. ,OzJohnno,London,"Mackay, Australia"
Hi.    We are coming to Scottish Hilands next week.  We have limited time but wish to see and explore as much as we can.  We plan on leaving our guesthouses very early have packed lunch with us in the car and do driving and sightseeing most of our day.    We don't mind driving a lot we actually enjoy it whatever is manageable within a day.    I'm having trouble putting together our itinerary for days 3 4 5 6 please let me know if we could fit all of this in our plan or is it too much driving:    DAY 3:  1. The Fairy Glen  2. Quiraing hike  3. Kilt Rock viewpoint  Viewpoint 1 – Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls  Viewpoint 2 – Trotternish sea cliffs  4. The Brother's Point viewpoint  5. An leth-allt view point  6. Rigg Viewpoint  7. The Storr hike  8. Bride's Veil Falls  9. Portree  Finishing the day in Portree.    DAY 4: (please advise which option makes more sense?)  Option 1: Drive from Isle of Skye to Ulapool  Bealach na Ba Viewpoint if the weather permits sleep in Ulapool    Option 2: Isle of Skye (and the sights we might not fit in the day 3?) then drive to Strathcarron detour to Bealach na Ba Viewpoint if the weather permits    DAY 5:  From Ulapool or Strathcarron (depends what we choose) drive to Dunrobin castle if time permits can we squeeze in north to Whaligoe steps and Duncasby steps? We need to drive then back to Dingle.    DAY 6:  Dingwall via Cairngorms NP (snow scenic road)  Loch ness (Urquhart castle) - is it worth it?

Hello all!    My boyfriend and I have decided to extend his last-minute work trip and double it as a London vacation! We will be there for a week in mid December. It is both of our first times traveling to London and actually both of our first times in Europe! We are so excited but also a little overwhelmed as to what all we should do so we want some (reasonably priced) expert advice!      Where should we stay? (Note: we plan on being out and about and not spending a lot of time in our lodging so we aren’t looking for the all-inclusive 5 star experience. But we definitely want to be somewhere clean safe and in a good location)  What are some must sees? Any tours or attractions? What should we get tickets or reservations for before hand? Any restaurants or pubs to try? Any day trips/excursions that are worthwhile? What are some packing essentials? Any special holiday themed things to do? Essentially if you have any London advice we want to hear it!    We are SO excited and appreciative of your help! ,Morgan A,London,Alabama
I'm planning to visit the Giant Causeway on November 10. I read the visitor center isn't worth it but on the website it says it is closed on November 10. Would I be able to park in the lot for free that day since there is no access to the center and no way to buy a ticket on the website?  Also is there another location for public toilets? We will be driving from Belfast and will want to use the toilet before heading to the causeway and back to Belfast. ,Aventure Travels,Bushmills,New Jersey
Slightly older ravers into disco soulful funk and house music for Saturday night - looking for recommendations for a happy crowd where the musics everything ,Simon Judson,Newcastle upon Tyne,"Long Eaton, United..."
Visiting London for the 3rd time first week of November and will have 2 full days to explore it on Sunday & Saturday.    First time over 3 days I did Houses of Parliament Westminster Abbey Tower of London Buckingham Palace Park of St.James area around Big Ben Trafalgar Square London Bridge (walk over and inside) Moulin Rouge show Piccadilly Circus some shopping on Regent walked South Bank Soho didn’t do London eye but of no interest.    Had a couple of things on my list left and when visited 2nd time didn’t do any of it instead just walked through the same places and went to see Hamilton show & walked Financial district did the Garden view on 120….    I feel like I need to be serious about this trip this time as I feel it’s probably last one for quite some time. What other things you would recommend for me to check out. I am young energetic solo female traveler. I prefer outdoor things given the time constraints as I feel I cover more things vs let’s say National Gallery where I will be stuck for a day to explore… unless of course something iconic like Buckingham palace that I missed. I don’t mind maybe seeing another show or maybe experiencing something like stadium or that huge cinema? What is out there else that I can do to wow myself. 😊    I used to have on my list that I didn’t do the following: St.Paul’s Cathedral View from Shard (but too pricey for what it is) Cable Car (nothing special but for view could consider) Change of Quards (but will eat too much time for what it is) stopping at the National Gallery for 2-3 hours. None of it seems as exciting though…. I do like to walk around to feel culture but I felt like I did a lot of it my 2nd trip. Perhaps specific neighborhoods/places to walk.    Would be very happy to hear your suggestions. ,InfinitSilver,London,Canada
We're planning to attend the Lord Mayor's Show on Nov 11 - does anyone have particular advice or experiences to share? I did find this useful link:  https://lordmayorsshow.london/practicalities/where-to-go  One thing I'm particularly wondering about is whether the return procession is equally fun/lively as the outbound or if the performers generally are worn out by then (i.e. is it worth dealing with more crowds in order to get the full experience). Thanks for any advice!  . ,Julie K,London,"Seattle, Washington"

My family is visiting London for a week - it’s me my partner and our 7-year-old. Our criteria for a hotel is 1) as nice as we can get but within our specific budget 2) central and on the tube and 3) 2 real beds not a sofa bed.    We’ve narrowed it down to Sea Containers London and the Pan Pacific London. Sea Containers is in Southwark near the Tate Modern. It’s a little cheaper than the Pan Pacific and includes breakfast but has a smaller room and is a little further from the tube.    Pan Pacific is near Liverpool Street station and has a nice big room but it seems like maybe a not as nice area perhaps with some dodgy areas nearby.    For a family looking to do some usual touristy things and visit friends in Hackney which hotel of the two would you recommend?    And please don’t suggest renting an apartment. We have been burned by Airbnb and VRBO descriptions and flaky hosts and we’d rather have the comfort of a hotel. ,ec0820,London,Los Angeles

I don't want to spend more than around $300 a night but would like to spend less. I've seen a few places like Club Quarters Hotel Trafalgar Square but not sure if that is the best place to go. Thanks for your help! ,Sassy_Rose72,London,San Diego...
I am hoping to connect on separate tickets from a domestic arrival to an international departure with hand luggage only. The Stansted Airport website says If you are connecting from a UK flight to an international flight you will need to pass through special immigration control points where you may be asked to show your passport.    Does that mean that I do not need to go through security again? It has been a while since I have arrived at Stansted on a domestic arrival so I presume that means that I can make a left turn when exiting the domestic wing and show my boarding pass and passport to the staff member who I recall sitting at the point where most passangers will go right to the domestic baggage belt? If that is correct then that will take me to the departures lounge. Thanks. ,Drumlog,Stansted Mountfitchet,"Belfast, United..."
Hi there my husband and I are planning on a two night stay between Xmas and new year. I feel spoilt for choice on looking at hotels we liked traditional hotels as long as they're not too tired but we also like modern hotels. We appreciate a good breakfast and a nice hotel bar. We intend to do a walking tour and mooch around the shops and probably visit Blenheim palace Im not saying price into taken into account but its not the deciding factor for us. ,holidaychicLondon,Oxford,"London, United..."
Hi I'm an older single traveler going to London 4 nights in November. I am looking for a hotel very close to underground for 1) travel safety at night 2) cut down on walking on old knees 3) cut down on being in the weather. Right now I'm looking at The Clermont Victoria Station at 230GBP/280USD. I'd like something less expensive but that amount is acceptable. All of my days will be spent out and about on first time tourist things and I plan to take underground/walk the entire time so fewer transfers and close to restaurants/pubs would also be a plus. ,susnshine2u,,"Greenville, SC"

We are looking to stay in Portreath mid May. It seems a great location between St Ives and Newquay for exploring the Cornish coast! I have a couple of questions about the area...    1) We are bringing a dog are the pubs/cafes around dog friendly?    2) I enjoy a walk through a village having a nosey in a few shops and stopping for a bit of lunch/coffee does Portreath offer the ability to do that? Is there small shops?    3) Restaurant recommendations are very welcome! ,Lauren N,Portreath,Leeds

Booking a trip from Liverpool Lime street to Woking on 13th December returning on 17th December.  At the moment only 13th december prices are showing should I book now as single or wait for 17th to come about and book as a return ticket?    Also would it be cheaper to book from Liverpool Lime street to London Euston and then take overground and tube to woking?    Appreciate any advice ,Holiday H,London,
Hi all I know this can't be helped. I arrived in Edinburgh yesterday. Weather wasn't too bad. Only starting to get windy and rainy now. My plan for next week was to take the train to Inverness and then possibly hire a car and drive to Aberdeen. I'm hoping by next week the storm will have cleared up. I'm flying out of Aberdeen so will have to be there for Sunday regardless. The rest I'm really playing by ear. Not sure how scenic the drive will be between Inverness and Aberdeen. I can scrap this and drive around either location instead. None of my plans are set in stone. I can still change substantially particularly if the storm means that's parts of Scotland are still recovering. Any advice on the itinerary would be appreciated.    Although I don't have the time or kit to do a really big hike I would like to spend dome time out doors. Preferably the Highlands close to either Edinburgh Inverness or Aberdeen. But I'm also just as happy visiting some nice smaller town maybe even stating overnight in one. Any suggestions? ,darrenlee9,Scotland,"London, United..."

There are currently five products:    Britain - valid across Britain. This is comparable to the All Line Rover product sold to UK residents but Britrail Britain is much cheaper and better. This product is available for 2 3 4 8 15 22 days and 1 month consecutively) as well as flexi versions (2 3 4 8 days in a month 15 days in 2 months)    England - valid in England only it is essentially 20% cheaper than the Britain pass and lacks the 2-day options but is otherwise similar in validity options.    South West - despite the name not a geographical pass; instead this is valid on all GreatWestern trains and Southwestern Railways with the single exception of Camarthern to Swansea. This includes all trains from London to Portsmouth Weymouth Southampton Bristol Devon and Cornwall Bristol Bath and Wales. Within its validity you are NOT allowed to use it on 'CrossCountry' trains nor local Welsh trains (i.e. those not run by GreatWestern). This is 30% cheaper than the Brit pass again no 2-day options.    London Plus- this covers a generous area of England around London and is very simply 40% cheaper than the Brit pass with ONLY 3 4 and 8 days in 1 month flexi options. The restrictions are based on geography not operator and include an area around London comprising all trains in:    * Oxfordshire  * Bedfordshire  * Hertfordshire  * Buckinghamshire  * Sussex  * Surrey  * Kent  * Essex  * Berkshire  * London  * Hampshire  * the line between Southampton and Weymouth (between Hampshire and Dorset)  * the line between Southampton and Salisbury (Hampshire to Wiltshire)  * the line between Salisbury and Basingstoke  * the line between Reading (Berkshire) towards Taunton but only as far as Bedwyn (Wiltshire)  * the line from Didcot (Berkshire) to Bristol Temple Meads (i.e. the London - Bristol TM via Bath Spa and Swindon line)  * the line from Oxford to Worcester Foregate  * stations between Banbury (Oxfordshire) and Stratford-upon-Avon (Warwickshire)  * the London to Cambridge lines  * the line from Cambridge to Kings Lynn via Ely  * the East Coast Main Line as far as Huntingdon (i.e. not Peterborough)  * the stations from Wolverton (Milton Keynes Buckinghamshire) to Long Buckby (only!) for trains which take the route via Northampton towards the Midlands and NW England    Spirit of Scotland. This is identical to the Spirit of Scotland travelpass freely sold in the UK which is cheaper and has better discounts available so don't buy this one. http://www.railrover.org/pages/spirit-of-scotland-travelpass.html    The available discounts for all Britrail are:    * age 5-15 50% but 1 free with each adult (not 16-25 nor group) or senior pass  * age 16-25 20%  * age 60+ 15%  * group of 3+ age 26-59: 20%    Note that these are considered zonal tickets and it is possible although not necessarily economical to combine them with other tickets beyond their validity. The train does not have to stop at the point where the changeover occurs. For example you could travel to Peterborough using a London Plus ticket from London by simply buying a Huntingdon - Peterborough ticket costing £7.10    In terms of pricing and getting value there are some points to note:    * the 2 3 and 4 day flexipasses cost almost the same per day £70-65. The 8-day pass starts to enjoy a saving at £47 (count 20% 30% 40% cheaper for England SW and London+ respectively  * the passes can be used within London but only on rail services including the Overground and Elizabeth line but NOT any tube services. They are also MUCH more expensive per day than the normal London options so if you are just buying one to travel around London you are likely to be doing it wrong  * the flexi passes are more expensive than the consecutive passes on a per-day basis but are likely to be more economical due to flexibility as for example they are very little value if you are sightseeing in London and if you are not rushing from place to place you may not get much benefit for them either.  * the products with the exception of the Scotland pass (which should not really be purchased as it is rubbish) have no peak restrictions. Peak trains are ruinously expensive for long distances due to them being crowded it is probably a good idea to avoid these trains anyway but they may well be essential for your needs e.g. if you are in York and need to catch a flight in London you don't really want to hang around. This can give absolutely huge savings for the Britrail pass over UK-resident products.    As an example if you were on a trip to London and wanted a sunny day to visit Bath you would be faced with a £69.20 bill for a 'super off peak day return' purchased on the day.    You can reduce this to £58.10 by buying a ticket London - Didcot and Didcot - Bath which would only be valid on trains stopping at Didcot (which is half of them)    If you were to purchase a 'family & friends railcard' costing £19 (current discount) a family of four could do this trip for £20.95 + £17.35 for the adults= £38.30 and 6+4.95 = £10.95 for the children using the Didcot trick. This comes to £98.50 or £49.25 each adult.    Meanwhile a Britrail London Plus would cost $156 (£43 per day) for a 3 in a month cost.    The Britrail pass would be valid at any time whereas the 'Didcot' Bath tickets would not be valid to leave Paddington before 10am on a weekday. If you are determined to leave at 7:30am or whatever you can likely buy an 'Advance' ticket for around £78 return (so more!) minus any railcard or group discount but Advance tickets are quite obnoxious in that it's usual on British railways to travel on any train (as you can with Britrail and whereas from Bath to London they are pretty frequent)) whereas with Advance you must commit to a specific train    As another example London - Portsmouth return would be around £26 on weekends or £32 on weekdays WITH railcard discount subject to some restrictions. This would be cheaper than Britrail London Plus typically.    As a further example London - Dover is around £21 return with railcard with some restrictions again cheaper than Britrail London Plus.    The Britrail Southwest is more expansive (and expensive). I can buy an 'Advance' ticket from London to Cardiff on Monday morning for £40 (without railcard railcard would be cheaper) which is cheaper than Britrail Southwest which costs £39 per day for 3 consecutive days. For Manchester or York around £55-60 and for Edinburgh £85 although in advance you can get it as low as £56.    In general I would say that you don't need a Britrail pass at all but in some circumstances it could be highly beneficial.    Since the more trips you do the more likely they will cost below the average daily cost of a Britrail it follows that shorter passes aimed at trips you know you need to take where Britrail is known to be cheaper are the most likely usage.    As an example a 2 in 31 flexipass at $170 ($251 in First) to travel say from London to Edinburgh and then from Kyle of Lochalsh back to London a week later will almost certainly be cheaper than buying tickets directly but a 15 day flexipass at $535 is very poor value....    In addition a $133 (or $202 in first class) 2-day consecutive pass would allow you to make any train journey in the UK (excluding private operators) some of which could cost significantly more than $133 so it will sometimes be worth it just for use for ONE journey (not even on two days)    I would note that the first class premium of 50% is one that is not really necessary in the sense that standard class is fine but this premium is 'cheap' in that the standard premium is 100%.    In addition the eligibility rules:    * any nationality including British  * can't buy from the UK online unless you use a VPN  * must not be a UK resident in the last six months. May need some proof of foreign residency.    If you are for example working in the UK for a month and needed to commute to an office the pass could be useful. For example from Reading to London is £24 per day off-peak but very expensive in the morning so an 8 day in 1 month pass costing just over £200 would be a good way to get to your (temporary!) workplace for 9am.    Full prices:    https://i.imgur.com/o058nns.png    Generally I would not bother but if you are planning some very long train journeys it may make sense. ,DunRomeIn,,london
We are staying at Astors Belgravia at 106-112 Ebury St. What is most reasonable way to get from Heathrow to this address. I see Astors Belgravia is near Victoria Station. Is Victoria Station the same as Victoria Coach station at 164 Buckingham Palace Rd. or are there two Victoria Stations (one named Coach and one not). We meet transport to the cruise ship at Victoria Coach Station (164 Buckingham Palace) & can't figure out if that's the same as Victoria Station near our home.

We are spending 9 days in London - arriving on the Eurostar then travelling to our accommodation (zone 3) on the first day (this is on a Saturday). Then the next 7 days sightseeing and finally heading home via Heathrow (probably looking at Elizabeth Line for this) on the last day. Looking to use contactless cards for day 1 & 9 and purchase Oyster cards and load them up with a 7 day Travel card for zones 1-3. What I'm looking to confirm is whether I can purchase the 7 day travel card (Oyster) on the day we arrive but for this to start (activate on day 2 - our first full day in London). ie When we purchase this from a machine does it ask us when (date) we would like this to start/activate? ,Craig,London,

We are travelling to London June 2023 (couple and 20 yr old daughter). We have family there but no one to actually stay with so we have booked an apartment in Hammersmith near Ravenscourt Park. via booking.com. It's a two bedroom apartment and looks pretty nice. Relatives have said it's too far west and we should have booked Fulham Chelsea Kensington  Greenwich or Paddington but their prices are at least $1000 AUD (GBP 520) more expensive (we are paying $2200 AUD for seven nights in Hammersmith). We can see we are relatively close to Ravenswood Park subway and Goldhawk subway. I have been spending hours trying to find info out and I see a lot of people dissing that area as a place to stay. Any thoughts? We have booked but payment is not due until next June so we can change if we need to. Any other suggestions on areas would be great. We would like to visit central London for usual tourist traps and have nice walkable atmosphere for dinner/drinks etc. TIA. ,Paramau,London,"Perth, Australia"

We have been in England visiting family in Surrey and had a one-day trip into London planned. This is how it unfolded.    Saturday morning’s sky arrived wrapped in a cloudy duvet and sprinkling rain. It was lovely to hear it on the roof. However it did not last and soon the blue was appearing. We had a quick breakfast my stomach was dreaming of a scone ( poetic license) and then were on our way to the train station destination the Victoria and Albert Museum aka V&A. Tickets purchased and on the platform only to find that the anticipated train was cancelled and we would have a 30 minute wait. Oh well! We were on the sunny side of the platform and it was now a pleasant morning. The train was packed but we held on and several stops later we got off safely “Mind the gap!” 15 minutes later we were on train #2 and on the final stretch. Alighting at Victoria “ Mind the gap!” we made our way outside and walked 35 minutes to the V&A using the GPS on the phone; we made a few wrong interpretations but the scenic walk through Belgravia and Kensington was lovely. I was wishing we had more time to explore but to have a day in London was a gift.    We approached the splendid building taking a few photos once double deckers had moved aside and then once inside decided that refreshments were in order as we planned our visit; a table in the sun bereft of pigeons a glass of wine and the entertainment of children by the lovely pool and a deep sigh of contentment was in order. Aaahhhh! We are here. Our first stop was a a marvellous photography exhibit; it was the works of the five finalists. I would not do justice to it by attempting a description so here is a link for anyone interested:  https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/prix-pictet-2023-human    We moved on through the Medieval and Renaissance rooms and eventually to that massive sculpture of Samson Slaying a Philistine; violent acts have ever been with us. It was soon time for my awaited scone. I was able to nab a table in the piano room and my sweetheart collected the essentials. As I poured my elderflower tea and smeared my scone first with cream and then jam ( correct way around I think) a young woman sat at the piano playing a beautiful piece. Her companion her dad perhaps was recording this on his phone. He encouraged the people in the room to applaud and after a short break she graced us with another piece. I wondered if these were her own compositions as I did not recognize either; it was a lovely accompaniment to my indulgence.    Our next couple of hours had us gazing at Rodin sculptures Canova’s Three Graces Donatellos and more. The Raphael Cartoons was a delightful room and we learned so much; these 7 large canvases were then repeated on tapestries.    https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/story-of-the-raphael-cartoons#slideshow=5239394909&slide=0    Then we moved to our final goal the Constables and Turners; among my highlights there was a painting The Cornfield by Peter de Wint. I must look at more of his work. Constable’s oil painting Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop’s Ground is considered one of the museum’s highlights; it is quite lovely. Our final stop was the gift shop where I purchased some lavender soaps and blank notecards my usual souvenirs.    It was time to head back and we indulged in a black cab trip to Victoria where we reversed the process headed back and as we emerged at our final stop the heavens opened. Our cousin was waiting and we were soon in the car and ten minutes later were “ home” with tales of the day’s adventures. The gaps had been minded ankles were intact. Wine was poured kitchen activities got underway and another day in lovely England was wrapped up with good company delicious food and gratitude for life’s pleasures.

Hello    I'm going on a business trip to England: flying in/out of Heathrow staying a few days in Oxford with one day in London before flying out again.    I'd prefer not to exchange money to bring cash and instead just use my credit card. Do you think I can avoid needing cash?    Here's what I plan to spend money on: transport from the airport to Oxford (Bicester specifically) take a bus to a site or two in Bicester take a train from Bicester to my hotel in central London and then to Heathrow. I'll be staying in hotels and hope to get food either as takeaway from grocery stores or from takeaway restaurants. Since I'm in London such a short time I just plan to do a few free things (I have tickets for the British Museum and plan to walk around and view a few other major sites from the outside like Buckingham Palace). Does this sound all doable with credit cards? I was especially wondering if that works ok with the public transport?    Thanks in advance! ,VitalHP,England,"Chicago, Illinois"
Newcastle Airport is an absolute disgrace and it's no good management blaming Covid for lack of staff for the total shambles because the place has been unfit for purpose for years. The following is a typical travellers experience - in the early hours of this morning we returned to NCL with Jet2 from Lanzarote. We're held on apron parking stand for 25 minutes before transfer buses arrived. As usual chaos in Border Control. Baggage was expected on Carousel 1 within 10 minutes with the Las Palmas next in line. 65 minutes later baggage appeared BUT it was the Las Palmas baggage!! Sometime later our baggage came up on Carousel 3. As usual not a single member of Airport staff to be seen. Then just for good measure both Exit doors closed and LOCKED still no staff.  Finally the taxi chaos. Because the airport schedules so many arrivals at the same time knowing full well that the infrastructure that can't cope - of course taxi company can't meet supply. To sum up - on stand at 01:50 got into taxi 03:44. What a disgrace the whole operation should be subjected to a full fit for purpose enquiry survey. Wonder if the Chief Exec Nick Jones knows or even cares about how badly his operation is run. ,R F,Newcastle upon Tyne,Newcastle upon...

While I only posted questions concerning my recent trip on the Manchester forum I did spend two and a half days in Liverpool and about two and three-quarters in Manchester. The MCR trip report will be posted on that forum. While I didn't post here I did read this forum often so thanks to all the frequent posters!    Day One: Landed in MAN and headed to the train station to get to Liverpool. After some headaches with weather and train cancellations I arrived.    My first impression was that Liverpool was a great sized walkable city with interesting architecture and an unfortunately high number of U.S. fast food imports. I checked into my teeny tiny cell of a hotel room at The Resident.    Although it was late in the afternoon I took the short walk to the Walker Art Gallery mainly to see the John Moores painting prize exhibit. Interesting. A charming guard named Arthur pointed out some of the highlights of the museum to me. I decided that if I found myself with time that I would return. I didn’t.    Had dinner at wonderfully named Pieminister because savory pies aren’t a big thing in the U.S. and I’m a huge Sweeney Todd fan. The meat pie I had was fine but my decidedly non-expert option was that there must be much better available.    Day Two: Up early to head to Albert Docks. The sky was clear and the sun was shining. Perfect morning. I headed to Rough Hands Bakery for breakfast with a view of the still blue water. So far so good.    The Maritime Museum was up next. I have a lot of thoughts about this place: basically they have too many objects and artifacts to view and too much text to read. I did enjoy the Lusitania exhibit mainly because it was manageable in scope. The International Slavery Museum while crucially important lacks flow and focus.    Had lunch at the museum cafe where I sat outside and stopped the seagulls from stealing my meal.    Then headed over to The Tate. This was just a few days before they relocated so the top floor was closed. I read reviews that indicated that the collection was sparse but after spending time at the Maritime Museum I was happy to see edited exhibits. I found a good deal of the art compelling and had an interesting conversation with a museum guard about the nature of port cities.    Breaking my no more than one or at the most two museums in a day rule I stopped at the small but interesting Open Eye gallery and gained a bit more insight on the Northwest.    I then did the most Liverpool tourist thing ever. I snapped a photo of The Lads in between all the other tourists posing among the Fab Four. (An astute TA poster said this would happen! I owe him a pound.) Exhausted I headed back to The Resident for the weeknight happy hour because I was exhausted and deserved a nice glass of wine.    I had made some hotel happy hour friends the night beforeso suggested that we head to The Philharmonic Pub. We saw the gent’s loo and I had another meat pie actually better than the one I had the night before. I knew it.    Day Three: Started the day going to the city’s cathedrals. The Gothic Revival Anglican one was up first. It was grand. I enjoyed the contemporary art near the altar. On the other end of Hope Street I was wowed by the modernist design of the Metropolitan Cathedral. Having been in tons of cathedrals I have to say that it is among the lovelist and most unique. It seems to have an elevated simplicity. Stunning.    Church visiting made me hungry so I headed to Victoria Museum and Gallery for lunch. The exterior of the building seemed instantly iconic and I adored the warm colored tiles that adorned the cafe. I lingered and then visited the small galleries.    After all this I headed to the Casa Pub suggested by the guard at the Tate. He thought I’d like it since it has memorabilia from former dockworkers and a big collection of photos of locals who fought the fascists in the Spanish Civil War. I thought I’d like it too so had a relatively quick look around.    The Tate guard also told me not to miss the Bluecoat Gallery which was already on my list so I headed there next. It was an interesting and inviting space with a lovely garden and a weirdly disturbing exhibit.    From there I had my final dinner in Liverpool at the Lebanese restaurant Blalchick and returned to my tiny room to pack to head to Manchester.    Epilogue: My biggest regret regarding my time in Liverpool is that I never managed to try scouse! Also the Bombed Out Church was closed for various private events each time I tried to visit. Finally Port Sunlight Village sounds like a great day trip. I guess this leaves something for a next time. ,baltoellen,Liverpool,"Baltimore, Maryland"
I’m staying at park plaza Westminster bridge. Never been to London before so it befuddles me! Anyway I’ve booked the Sherlock live escape room in Shepherd’s Bush. Is it feasible to get the city cruise to this or will it be nowhere near and the tube be best?  Thanks ,Mrssniffle,London,
Hello    I'll be on a brief business trip to London. I will fly into Heathrow then need to get to my hotel in Bicester (Oxford). I will need to take a bus to another site in Bicester then back to my hotel. Later I will need to get from Bicester to my hotel in central London and then the next day to Heathrow.    Any tips on how to research the best public transport I should take or deals I should look into?    Thanks in advance! ,VitalHP,England,"Chicago, Illinois"
Thanks for everyone who responded to my queries regarding my trip. If you don't read the report the upshot is that I absolutely LOVED Manchester and hope to return. If you want to read the Liverpool part of the trip it's on that forum.    Day One: Took the very easy journey from Lime Street Station to Manchester Picadilly. This was the second time seeing MCR from the train–the first was from the airport to Lime Street Station–and I really liked the way the city looked: the little canals the red brick Victorian-era buildings the glass and steel skyscrapers. I’d been told that MCR was an ugly city and I thought about the eye of the beholder and all that. I liked the mishmash cityscape. Once off the train I really liked the way the City felt with its diverse population and urban energy.    After dropping my luggage off at Motel One in St Peter’s Square I headed straight to The People’s History Museum. I had been looking forward to visiting since learning about it and couldn’t wait to get there. But first lunch. As I’d done in Liverpool the midday meal was at a museum cafe.    The museum didn’t disappoint. In fact I loved it although some of the more nuanced aspects of English politics in the exhibits went over my head. For the right person this museum is reason enough to visit Manchester.    I then headed to the very popular and crazy crowded John Rylands Library. It was far too packed to enjoy. This was my second major neo-Gothic building that I’d seen in two days and I guess that fact that it wasn’t Gothic-era Gothic made it seem sort of meh.    Next up was the Manchester Art Museum which too was mobbed like it was the Louve or Sistine Chapel. I didn’t get it. I saw a guard and asked if there was a way to see the museum that made any real sense and he showed me where to begin but honestly I couldn’t concentrate on anything I saw and it was getting close to closing anyway.    I took the short walk back to my hotel said hello to Mrs Pankhurst in St Peter’s Square and took a quick rest. (Short aside: I’m generally a small Mom-and-Pop type guesthouse person but was impressed with the hotel.)    After a rest I took the two minute walk to Chinatown and decided to eat at the Sichuan place called Noodle Alley. It had good service and was decent and affordable.    Day Two: After a quick breakfast at one of the chain coffee shops in St Peter’s Square I walked to the Pankhurst Center. What an inspiring place. It’s well curated and fits a lot of great information in its small special space.    I then walked to the Whitworth Gallery. I found some exhibits compelling and some less so. I had lunch in the pretty cafe that was crowded with the people who brunch.    On the walk back to the hotel I stopped at the Manchester Museumand didn’t really see anything because I was indeed officially museumed-out.    After a short rest I walked for two minutes and was back in Chinatown. I had dinner at a Malaysian restaurant called Kaya. It’s relatively new and they’re trying hard but it was really just ok.    Final Day: Started the day across the street from my hotel at the main public library. I was silly not to have visited on my first day because they have a good tourist info center right when you walk in. I had coffee in the little cafe and looked around.    I then headed to another library: the Portico. It’s a gem. And it feels hidden well at least you have to ring a door well and walk up several narrow flights of stairs to enter. The staff is enthusiastic and might even let you in to take a peek at the member’s only reading room. It’s a small place that you could see in about ten minutes but you’ll probably want to stay a bit longer.    After pulling myself away from that joy of a library I took a long walk to the Jewish Museum. It was great to learn of how one group came to settle in Manchester and the synagogue which is not in use for worship is a beautiful Sephardic one. The little cafe in the front looked great and I had a coffee because I was saving my appetite for another MCR institution which would be my next stop.    I had been lazy just eating at museums and in Chinatown but I did want to get to a “rice and three” place so I went to This and That. It was satisfying and I was happy to chow down in a local institution. The food however wasn’t particularly memorable.    I walked aimlessly around the Northern Quarter for a bit and then decided to get on the tram and head to the Imperial War Museum. I arrived sort of late and was literally lthe last person they let in for the day. The very short time there–under thirty minutes–just made me want to return.. (And big thanks to the person here who suggested it for an open on a Monday museum and said that it was “better than it sounded!”)    Back in St Peter’s Square I rested and as was now my daily schedule headed to Chinatown. The restaurant of choice was Pho Que. (Actually they should call it Pho Queue since there’s always a line as there seems to be at most restaurants!) It was a comfortable place and the pho was phine. I walked the two minutes back to my hotel to pack.    Epilogue: I absolutely loved Manchester. What a fantastic place to visit. My days were fairly packed–and I’m usually a take it easy type of slow traveler–and there was so so much that I missed including entire neighborhoods. For the next trip–and I’m sure that they’ll be one–I plan to visit Castlefield especially the viaduct; the Lowry and more of the Imperial War Museum Chetham’s Library Aviva Studios Altrincham market area and I’m sure there’s more. ,baltoellen,Manchester,"Baltimore, Maryland"

Hello everyone    A little advice needed.    With my wife and 2 teenagers we will be staying in the center of Brighton next week. We want to find a nice pub that shows football (preferably on a big screen).    We are looking for a sports bar with a good atmosphere but not necessarily too noisy (i.e. no crowds coalitions etc.). If you could recommend somewhere to get some good pub food too that would be great.    Thanks in advance ,Julien M,Brighton,

Trip next week and I have more questions!    I planned to take air coach from Dublin airport to belfast (and then to belfast City airport for car rental).

I had posted about this a few years back but our trip was delayed due to Covid. We will be hiking on the Coast in September with a car but have heard that despite short distance between places traffic. Can be very busy. So am wondering if it is best to base in two areas as our hikes will span from Golden Cap to Swanage/Poole area.  I had thought to spend entire time based in Weymouth as is central to all but now thinking maybe three nights in Wareham and same in Bridport or Branscombe or ???  We would like a quieter area smallish with good pub(s) and one or two fine dining choices. Thought Lyme Regis sounded too busy touristy but may be wrong.  Anyhow am I correct that two bases are better than one and recommendations for where specifically to stay (I.e. which towns)?

My family and I will be traveling to Liverpool from December 28 through January 4 with my 5-year-old daughter along. We already have two days scheduled: one will be spent at Anfield watching a match against Newcastle and the other will be spent on a Lake District tour.  Could you please recommend some places we shouldn't miss while we're here?  Are there any outside-organized celebrations for the new year like in other cities and are there any fireworks displays? If not could you make some suggestions for how we might pass the evening given that we won't be able to go out to a bar because we'll be bringing our daughter?  Are stores open on New Year's Day?  As a final question can you recommend any enjoyable activities we can take our daughter to? After some research I've found on the Liverpool Wheel and the Ice Festival.    Thanks ,Maresca S,Liverpool,

I'd be grateful if you would please share some input on my preliminary thoughts for a trip to England.    First some background - this will be for two adults (husband & wife) celebrating a 60th birthday with a first trip to England. We like history nature good food active adventures where we can learn about the people and the culture of a place. We like to see a lot but not go around just checking off the list of top attractions even though we want to see most popular things we also love the lesser known places too and can go from early morning to end of day - but like to stop and smell the roses too (or have an afternoon where we just sit down and relax people watching). We are from USA have been to Europe so we have dealt with major time change difference.    Depending on flights (still waiting for all dates to be available) the plan is to leave USA on or around August 30 2024 and stay 14 full days in England. We are thinking that the best way to start is with some days in London since best option will be to fly into Heathrow (some direct flights from Cincinnati). Probably will want to stay there 4 nights minimum and then eventually make our way to York.    At this point I'm trying to decide if it would be best to move over to Bath (maybe 2 nights) move to the Cotswolds (Bourton-on-the-Water maybe for 2 nights - all of this is tentative) and somehow make it on up to York for a few days there before heading back to USA (again just thinking minimum of 3 nights in York). Then move our way back to London for a flight home (arriving there one night before flight back day).    Does this sound too much? Should I just bump days in London and make day trips to Bath and the Cotswolds and then move straight up to York? If I do the stay overnight in those two places where should I pick as a between place before getting to York? I'd thought about the Peak District (I'd love to go up to Lake District but think that would be pushing it).    I would also love any private driver/tour guide recommendations - I've been researching a LOT and maybe I'm overthinking the need for them? We don't have a problem with public transportation but we really like going at our pace and we also haven't driven in Europe. We used private drivers in Italy Greece and Croatia and that worked so well for us (no stress husband could actually see everything without worrying about speed/parking/directions) so I almost think this would be an expense we might need to add to the trip.    I've tried to be concise but I want to include enough information that you can best answer. Please let me know if I missed answering questions you have. I really appreciate any help and thank you for taking time to read this! ,Sara365_13,England,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

I used to study in the UK and took the bus to London every weekend for a few months. However it's been about 15 years and I miss being able to wander around in the beautiful city whenever I wanted trying new things like a kid. When the weather gets warmer I'd like to take a few weeks off work and go stay in the city and really explore it rather than only focusing on touristy areas which I have already seen anyway. I know it could take a lifetime but in order to be reasonably familiar with the city such as knowing the transportation system knowing a few nice coffee shops and restaurants and being familiar with the culture and a few local small streets without having to consult a map ALL the time how long would it take to get to know the city? Thanks in advance for any thoughts and opinions. ,superkathy,London,San Diego...

Hello!    I am looking for an area to stay that is convenient to Lloyd of London but would still be fun for tourists. Surrounding areas with a short tube right would be perfect! I love Notting Hill and Kensington but those seem too far away. I stayed on the Southbank last time and want something a little different this time.

Hello we are currently in London and have decided we’d like to try to see Matilda we have tomorrow and Saturday open to go. I realize this is very last minute and it’s a popular show but due to circumstances we didn’t know we’d be able to go before now.    My question is how do we go about buying tickets? I read somewhere to get the TodayTix app which I downloaded and I’ve read there are ticket sellers down in Leister Sq area can you also just buy direct from the theatre the show is playing at early in the day of the day you want to go. I’m sorry to be so naive about how to do this but in Canada we generally buy tickets for things like this through Ticketmaster.    I don’t want to buy from somewhere that is a scam and pay for something and get to the show and have no legit tickets and be out the money.    I’m not trying to necessarily get discounted tickets (but maybe day if they are always discounted - I have no idea) I just want to make sure I have legit tickets.    Thanks in advance for any help with the ins and out of how this is done here it’s much appreciated! ,eyeguysgirl,London,Canada

We're visiting Scotland in September. Being our second visit we thought we'd spend the first 4 days or so in the south seeing what we can from the East Coast to the Borders. So I'm looking for suggestions for a semi-central place to use as a base so we're not bouncing around. We'll have a car. From Dumfries it'd be about a 2-hour drive northeast to Ayrshire and the same northwest to Melrose and the Border abbeys. So that seems like a candidate. Perhaps Moffat? Nice to come home to a good tavern and B&B so that's a strong pull. Suggestions? ,Bill M,Scotland,"New Castle, Delaware"

There are 4 of us going to London mid October and we would like to day trip to the Cotswolds. We have looked at bus tours that start in London as well as tours starting in the Cotswolds. We thought we’d prefer to tour without a group and one of us is willing to drive.    We thought it might be easiest on the driver to take the train from London to a town in the Cotswolds where we could then rent a car and visit the towns we’d like to see. Other option we thought was to rent a car from somewhere out of central London- perhaps from Heathrow and drive all the way to the Cotswolds.    Renting the car from let’s say Heathrow might be potentially cheaper then paying for a train ticket then car rental.    If price is not really too much different which way of doing it would be the easiest. ,eyeguysgirl,London,Canada
Hi I’m staying in central London next week for a few nights and wondered if there are any show restaurants? Taking my 11 year old son ,Mrssniffle,London,
Hello!    We are planning our first visit to England and so looking forward to it! We want to spend 8 days in London 8 days in the Cotswolds and 3 days in Oxford.    We dont want to rent a car in the Cotswolds in order to save that for some good food and some shopping. We are in our mid 30s and 40s and love easy hikes.    We decided to base ourselves in a BnB in Bourton on the Water and take as much public transport as possible and an occasional taxi. This is our initial plan and I would appreciate any feedback.    Friday June 21: Move to Bourton on the Water from London    Saturday June 22: Explore Bourton-on-the-Water. Sunday Roast @ The Plough Inn. Rissington round walk.

How difficult is it to get from Newhaven cruise port into Edinburgh. Is castle near city centre. Not crucial for us to go in castle; just would like to walk around if feasible. Is transport to and from Edinburgh near port in Newhaven?

Thank you. ,jurynaples25,Edinburgh,"naples, FL"

Hello - we are coming to Europe from California US for two weeks over my kids school break. My kids (13 & 11) will be coming to Europe for the first time. My husband & I have been before - but never Switzerland or London (where we are flying in and out of). We have our Switzerland rail trips scheduled and booked. We are an active bunch - although we are not planning to try and ski this trip. I don’t know how many museums I could get my VERY active 11 year old boy to do and we may often be looking for some local basketball gyms so he can get his fix and tire him out. We would like to really experience London and perhaps one other city/area? Amsterdam? Or Paris - but bed bugs are scaring me. And we have to get to Zurich from London either 18 or 19 Dec. Other areas that look beautiful for Christmas and not far from Zurich - Colmar Riquewihr Eguisheim? I realize this is pretty vague! Any suggestions are welcome. Here is our itinerary so far:    Dec 16 Saturday - 6pm flight to London  Dec 17 Sunday - 1pm arrival into London  Dec 18 Monday - ???  Dec 19 Tues - Zurich  Dec 20 Wed - Rail Trip Zurich to Zermatt  Dec 21 Thurs - DAY Trip to Gornergrat Rail  Dec 22 Fri - Rail Trip - Glacier Express to St Moritz  Dec 23 Sat - DAY Trip (St Moritz to Tirano) BERNINA EXPRESS  Dec 24 Sun - train from St Moritz to Zurich  Dec 25 Mon  Dec 26 Tues  Dec 27 Wed  Dec 28 Thurs  Dec 29 Fri  Dec - 30 Sat  Dec 31 Sun - London  Jan 1 Mon - flight home    Thank you!

I was wondering if anyone could recommend a car/van service from LHR to Kensington area. We will have a lot of luggage due to my medical supplies I do home dialysis. It’s only my husband and I however I’m estimating around 4 large suitcases (might be 3 not sure yet) 1 dialysis machine in carrying case (large cube) and 8 boxes of supplies. We will be arriving early December 15 if that makes a difference.    Quite a lot of luggage! This is my first time traveling abroad since starting dialysis and I’d appreciate any recommendations for transport. I’m also open to a taxi but I wasn’t sure how easy it would be for the amount of luggage we will have with us. We’ve used Blackberry Cars on prior trips and I’ve requested a quote from them but I’d like to find options of possible. Thanks again for any help! ,EllieandMilo,London,"Memphis, Tennessee"

I will be arriving to London Liverpool St. station from an Essex overhead line Great Anglia.and am trying to estimate time allowed to catch my train to Yorkshire from Liverpool St. The tube map indicates that from Liverpool St I can go to St Pancras by several tube lines Metrolpolitan Hammersmith Circle . connecting at Moorgate.  I am confused by the signs on the maps connecting Liverpool St with Moorgate i.e. 2 black lines with wheelchair signs. I know the wheelchair signs indicate an appropriate route are they tunnels lifts outside pathways? I am not a wheelchair user.  I would appreciate some guidance as to how get from Liverpool St. to Moorgate as I will be carrying luggage  have a long distance train to catch to Yorkshire and therefore do not want to be faffing around loooking for the route.  many thanks ,gem1662016,London,Leigh-on Sea...

If we are just walking around Kirkwall for our time there (cruise 5/28/24) and we want to see Cathedral of St. Magnus on Broad St. and Earls Palace Watergate St. do you have any suggestions for a town map. Is there anything on line to help us walk around. We are in our 70's and happy to walk; sounds like if we focus on Historical Kirkwall Old town (Cathedral) we will see lovely narrow lanes etc. and then Earl's Palace. Are they close?

My husband 13-year-old daughter and I are aiming to visit the North Yorkshire Moors for about 5-7 days next July. I've been to Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay before but I'd like to take them somewhere a little inland suitable for hiking finding somewhere to horse-ride for a day or two and good access to visit places like York as well as the coast. My daughter loves animals so any farms that have holiday accommodation would be ideal. I plan to hire a car while we're over so transport won't be an issue.

Hi we are taking a family trip to Belfast over midterm for couple of nights (from Galway) and am looking for ideas for older teens. I am wondering are we better to do the HOHO bus or take a Black Cab tour for city touring; also would you know if We Are Vertigo is good for older kids or more for younger ones? My teens love Italian or Mexican food so any particular recommendations for these would be welcome. We are staying city centre Donegall Sq.  We are planning to drive to Giants Causeway & Carrick-a-Rede if weather is anyways reasonable. I was also looking at The Jungle Fright Night but it's a good spin from the city so not sure if it's worth it... any comments welcome. Any other thoughts or suggestions would be gratefully received.

Hoping someone can please tell me whether or not there are any tours or if one can visit the Racecourse ground. My teenaged son is quite interested in Wrexham after viewing a certain Hulu series - even more so now that they have secured promotion. Very exciting!    We are visiting Chester in early June and will go to Wrexham for the day via train.    The official AFC site has very little information about visiting other than the fact that the club shop is available which we will definitely visit as it is near impossible to purchase anything online as everything is always out of stock.    Any tips for a teen who wants to see everything he can about the football club? Thank you! ,AJ,Wrexham,"Austin, Texas"

I know the usual advice is that advance tickets are much more affordable than the Britrail passes (which are not sold to UK residents). I've done advance tickets in the past but as I get older and more aware of the vagaries of travel I chose to purchase a 4 day/30 days first class pass this September. I planned two days out from London--Rye and Brockenhurst for the New Forest--and a round trip to Sheffield/Chesterfield for 3 nights in Bakewell. The cost was about $320 or say 290 GBP.  1. Day one in London too tired to go anywhere. Day 2 planned on Brockenhurst but the weather was overcast and windy while Rye offered more sunshine. So off to Rye; walkup tickets one-way were around 40 GBP (no first class). Came home sooner than planned as there was a water disruption and toilets were affected--none available at the nature reserve. Oh well.  2. To Chesterfield--I could have pre-booked this one but walkup fares in first class were over 100 GBP.  3. Return to London--I planned to take the 10.23 218 bus from Bakewell to Sheffield for the train. Short version at about noon four of us took a Uber; a bus finally appeared but was broken down and the driver said going nowhere! So an advance ticket would have been lost.  4. To Brockenhurst again I had a choice of days but I was so tired from (3) that I put off this tip for a day. Again checking times at the ticket machine walk-up fares one-way were around 40 GBP first class. With the pass I returned to London as I chose. (Never saw a pony just cows!)  The point is that advance tickets can indeed be more economical than the pass but as a tourist flexibility is valuable not just because well it is flexible but it removes stress. ,vnrose52,,"Redlands, California"
Hello I wonder if anyone can recommend an afternoon tea spot in either Kensington or Chelsea? We have been looking online and it becomes very overwhelming so hoping someone may have a personal recommendation.    We are looking to spend in the £40-£60 range there are 4 of us somewhere that has a traditional feel as opposed to a modern twist. I think the ones at the fancier hotels run around £80 which is more than we hoped to spend we would love a pretty atmosphere with flowers/gardens would be a bonus.    11 Cadogan Gardens looks and sounds nice but I only found 1 traveller review and they only gave tea a 1 star whilst the hotel itself gets very high ratings so maybe the 1 review is not a true indication.

A few years ago I drove out from London(where I live) to Kent a short drive. I wasn't expecting much but I have since returned. This is a trip report of my recent visit of Kent (my fifth time).  Itinerary included the regular stops and some new discoveries:  I'll post them all for the reader's sake:  Day 1. Rent car in Heathrow. Drive to Tunbridge wells. It was a cold October morning so I bought a delicious hot chocolate at a lovely little store. Then I walked around town enjoying some fine regency architecture. Then we drove up to Rochester. Rochester has a very historic and picturesque old centre. We proceeded down to Whitstable a thoroughly enjoyable stop and got an ice cream even though it was raining. That's life in the UK for you!  Had lunch in Whitstable.  Next we drove to Canterbury and spent the afternoon enjoying the old town river and cathedral.  Slept there. ,NormandInLondon,,"London, United..."
Dear Wales Lovers    I am planning my first trip to Wales for next year probably by car. I am most probably travelling alone unless I found a new dog companion until then ;-)    now with one overnight stop on the way to Wales and back (coming from Germany) I am not sure how to use my 12 nights wisely.    1) Stay a few nights at the Pembroke coast and one week in Snowdonia.  2) Focus on only one area which would be Snowdonia then. I love mountains walking (in case I will be fit) but also cliffs and the sea and coastal walks but I definitely want to stay a little bit longer in Snowdonia as I love mountain view lakes and rivers.    Option one: I would see different areas  Option 2: more relaxing as the arrival is already that long from Germany and I wouldn't have to check out and in again and drive 4h to continue to Snowdonia but I would have only one base.    I would appreciate your opinion on which plan is better. I will be travelling in spring.    All the best enjoy your time and take care!  Bridget ,Bridget,Wales,Germany

We (family of 5 - 2 adults 2 teens and 1 tween) have a long layover at LHR on our return BA flights from CDG to the US. This is not our first trip to the UK but it is for the kids.    Specifically we are scheduled to land at LHR on Sat 12/30 @ 4:40pm and depart Sunday 12/31 at 4:15pm.    Two questions:    - Will BA allow us to check our luggage all the way through to our final destination?    - Our plan is to take the tube into the city and stay at the Doubletree Kensington. We’d have dinner near the hotel kick back and then do the HoHo bus in the morning to hit the highlights making our way back to LHR around noon. Does that sound reasonable?

We will have 8 nights/9 days in June 2024 to explore our first visit to Scotland. 2 adults and 2 kids (10 yo). We will likely take an express train from Liverpool to Edinburgh or Glasgow loop to the west highlands and fly home to US from Inverness. We will hire a car for our highlands adventures. My kids are HUGE Harry Potter fans so incorporating the Jacobite ride would be a big plus (or maybe we will just catch it passing from the hillside). We could also try to do the train ride as our last lazy day activity the day before we fly out of Inverness if that seems feasible? We like easy hikes castles beaches beautiful scenery. We'd like to incorporate an island or at least some beach scenery but I don't want to obsess on that or get wrapped up in traffic and crowds when there's so much for us to explore in so little time!

I was in London for the weekend and went to see the David Hockney exhibition at the Lightroom in the new development behind Kings Cross (it's beyond Coal Drops Yard). It's quite expensive (I paid £25 at an off peak time but there were very few people there which was good) and I hesitated to spend that much (being a Yorkshire woman by adoption).    But I really enjoyed it and have been raving about it to friends since I got home. It's not an immersive experience with headsets (I went to the Notre Dame Eternelle in Paris earlier this year which is and is great and also expensive!). I would describe it as a kind of documentary in which David Hockney himself talks about his art how and why he got into photography and it's illustrated with huge projections of the works he's talking about. They are often reconstructed layer by layer presumably reflecting his process as he worked on this exhibition with the London Theatre Company (the people behind the new Bridge Theatre and the fantastic production of. Guys and Dolls) and a studio design company. If it all sounds be too high brow remember David Hockney is a down to earth Yorkshire man and just talks plain sense.    It's on until December 3 and I believe it's then going to tour internationally. If you are interested in late 20th century art in the future of multimedia in beautiful pictures of the Yorkshire Wolds Normany and swimming pools or need something very different to do in London I do recommend it (and sadly I'm not on commission).

So Ambleside judging by the footfall going through it and also it's various hotels and eating establishments does appear to be doing well. So why for the public toilets are they charging 60p per person. I am aware there are costs incurred in keeping places clean however to me 60p is merely fleecing the visitors on their visit. So yes I'd like to understand who decided to set the charge at that price and why? ,Odyssey35041,Ambleside,"Norwich, Norfolk"

I’d really like to visit isle of mull cheese which is 20 min walk there n back so is 1.5 hours in Tobermory enough?

Is this correct or did i miss a way to apply for an electronic Visitor Oyster card which can be loaded to my phone?

We will be driving from Glasgow to Glen Coe in May for one night. I'm wondering if the extra drive along Loch Leven to Kinlochleven is worth it. I've read that the drive around the loch is beautiful. If it is we would stay there for the night. We will be heading to Pitlochry the next day.    Your thoughts please.  Linda ,SunFun999,Scotland,"Palm Bay, Florida"

Traveling to London Dec 4-8 and booked this Airbnb. https://abnb.me/MbZ8qcJ6HDb    The address is listed as the Tower 1 Saint George’sWharf and the unit is on the 37th floor.    Have read several posts and the WiredUK related article in this forum about AirBnb scams and I am concerned. While it is a new listing (which all properties are at some point) the lack of reviews in tandem with the location and pricing may in fact be red flags. It appears to be new building however I do not see a unit number listed which is also somewhat concerning. The host has no other properties and the unit appears to be booked up which adds to the intrigue of why no reviews so far.    Any advice would be appreciated. ,Cocoboca01,London,"Boca Raton, Florida"
Hello. I wanted to ask if Thameslink is the cheapest train to Gatwick airport. Is it also only accessible through St. pancras train station? And finally is it same price if i book online or book or the spot? ,navis84,London,"Athens, Greece"
We are arriving the end of the month on a weekday morning  We DO NOT want to take public transport  I have read the reviews of pre hire cars from Blackberry cars 12 transfers Addison Lee etc  They ALL have some horrible reviews of unreliable drivers drivers that are late companies called scams or just not customer friendly.  My question therefore is simple after we collect our luggage (just one luggage each for 2 of us)  will it be better to use the Uber app to request an Uber or just walk outside to take a taxi?  I don't think it will be more than the £94 blackberry cars quoted.  Thank you in advance. ,kim r,London,Los Angeles...

We just arrived in the Russel Square area and are here for 2 nights before we need to be at Gatwick to fly home.  The plan was to take a taxi to Victoria Station and take the Gatwick Express to the airport.  However I have seen the recommendation on here to take Southern rather than the Gatwick Express.    We are leaving here early morning- we need to be at Gatwick by 8:00 am.  Which should we take? I don’t want to get caught in rush hour on a train with our luggage.  Thanks in advance. ,Lori W,London,"Vancouver, Canada"
Our family (college-age kids) will visit Scotland in May 2024 flying from US to Edinburgh for a 10-day trip. I'm really attracted to the Argyll area perhaps somewhere around Loch Fyne and am considering basing us there for a few days. We'd like to avoid spending the majority of our time driving around the entire country and focus more on one or two areas. We've had success with this approach on other trips.    However part of me is fighting against FOMO about the other popular areas like Skye and Inverness not to mention the North Coast 500 which just seems like too far of a drive for our first trip to Scotland. So many compelling places to visit!    So just looking for some fans of Argyll to confirm my instincts of it being a good (somewhat) off-the-beaten path choice to spend some time during a first trip to Scotland. Or if you think this is a mistake would welcome your opinion as well.    We're also planning to head up to Ft. William / Glencoe briefly so my daughter can either ride or see the Jacobite Steam Train and then to Loch Tay area as well as two days in Edinburgh. ,donnam,Argyll and Bute,"Raleigh, North..."

Below is my general itinerary from our mid September trip (with lots of walking and photo ops in between) in hopes that it helps someone else. Tried to keep it brief but……My husband and I based ourselves in Edinburgh and took day trips. Didn’t want to drive or wake up in a different place each day. Stayed at the Hilton Carlton because we like to utilize our points. Great location right off the Royal Mile and a 5-10 minute walk to Waverly Train Station and Edinburgh Bus station and walkable to all of the sights and restaurants. We only used Uber once to the Royal Yacht Brittania (and in Glasgow). The breakfast/service/room were all very good. Weather was often rainy/drizzly but never enough to ruin plans and we also had some blue sky days. Ignore the weather forecast and and always have a rain jacket/umbrella ready even if there is no rain in forecast. I toggled between Weather Channel and UK Met Office which often had completely opposite forecasts and neither were correct! After a few days of planning around the weather we decided to just get on with it!    Day 1: Arrival from US JFK via Delta. We got lucky and arrived on time. Carry on only and barely any wait to exit airport. Took the Airlink 100 bus – stop is right outside the airport doors and you just tap your credit card – £5.50 to the last stop St. David St. (approx. 30 minutes) and then it was a 10 minute walk to our hotel. Could not have been easier. Spent the rest of the day walking the city and taking in all the beautiful architecture and sights.    Day 2: Toured Edinburgh Castle in the morning. Had 9:30 tix purchased in advance. Arrived at 9 and there was already a line. The castle is like a mini-city and there is so much to see. We would have preferred a guided tour but only the audio tour was available when we booked. Finished at 12:30 but stayed around for one o’clock gun. You can easily spend a whole day here if you are the type to read all the panels. It’s very windy at the castle scarf and hood came in handy. In the afternoon we toured The Real Mary King’s Close. Very interesting underground guided tour that gave a glimpse into how people used to live/work in EB. They were turning people away so definitely book in advance.    Day 3: Train from Waverly to Glasgow. We walked to the Necropolis and Glasgow Cathedral (St. Mungo’s) – both beautiful! Then ubered crosstown to the Riverside Museum (transportation museum that I thought my husband would enjoy). It’s full of cars trams trains from the past and very well done. A must if you have kids or seniors with you especially. There is also a tall ship docked behind the museum that you can tour. All the above attractions were free. We enjoyed the above but I wasn’t really feeling Glasgow and in hindsight I would have preferred to go somewhere else. We headed back to EB earlier in the day than we anticipated. FYI off peak train fares are almost half the price of peak.    Day 4: We climbed Arthur’s Seat. It was raining at the onset and there was rain in the forecast but by the time we got to the top the sun/blue sky appeared. Views are beautiful but very windy! It took us about 75 minutes round trip including time for photos. Sneakers are fine but if you can fit hiking boots in your luggage they would come in handy for this as it was a little slippery and uneven. Don’t miss St. Anthony’s chapel on the way down. Afterwards we planned to tour Holyrood Palace but the weather was so nice instead we signed up for a last minute 2 hour walking tour with City Explorers. Tours are free but the guides rely on generous tips. Our guide Phil was very funny a great storyteller and we learned a lot. We took advantage of the clear skies and walked up to Calton Hill for sunrise in the evening. A great spot no matter what time of day – don’t miss it.    Day 5: I took a bus tour to St. Andrew’s with Rabbies Tours guide was Jim and he was great! It was a lovely day out of the city and St. Andrew’s beachfront area is stunning! We had a 30 minute stop in the cute coastal resort town of Anstruther then a 3 hour stop in St. Andrew’s which was enough time to walk along the water tour the cathedral ruins (or you can do the castle) do a little shopping and have lunch on one of the three main streets in town. The only negative IMO was the afternoon stop – one hour in Falkland – there really wasn’t much to do there but grab a coffee/food and we had just had lunch in St. Andrew’s. I would have preferred more time at the first stop or SA. My husband stayed back in EB and climbed the Scott Monument did a tasting at the Scotch Whiskey Experience and did a food/drink walking tour with Eat Walk Tours. He enjoyed them all.    Day 6 & 7: We left EB on a 2 day/1 night tour with Rabbie’s to Loch Ness Inverness and the Highlands. We really enjoyed it and lucked out with only 6 people on our tour so it was like having a private guide. The days are long but our guide Lizzie was excellent and a great driver. Too many stops to mention but the highlight was a boat ride on Loch Ness docking at Urquhart Castle – stunning scenery one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. Before boarding the boat our guide brought carrots for us to feed to the hairy coos. So cute. The only negative IMO was the lunch stop on the second day - 90 minutes at Fort William was too long not much to do many stores were permanently closed or closed for the day IMO it had little charm. I suppose it works out geographically though. We are not long sit down lunch kind of people so that doesn’t help either. That said I highly recommend Rabbie’s their tours are very well done.    Day 8: Back in EB. We toured the Royal Yacht Brittania. Enjoyed the audio guide and it was cool to see the Queen’s rooms and the entertaining areas as well as the personal family photos on the walls throughout the ship. Capped off the experience by enjoying the view with cream tea in the Royal Deck Tea Room. In the afternoon we visited Edinburgh Museum (free) – it looks deceptively small on the outside but it’s huge! Lots to see. My husband also did a tasting at Johnnie Walker while I walked around the kirkyards at St. John’s and St. Cuthbert’s (amazing photo op of the castle from here).    Day 9: Airlink 100 from St. David St to the airport. Arrived at airport around 7:40 and breezed through security (no wait). I was glad we didn’t bother with fast passes. Loved Scotland and hope to return one day!    Food – all dinners were booked in advance  The World’s End Pub – good food and atmosphere  Whiski Bar – good food high on atmosphere – very cozy they pack you in like sardines though very busy – they were turning people away service was slow  Deacon Brodie’s Pub – fun place  The Dome – one of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever been to food was good as well. Tried Sticky Toffee Pudding for the first time. It was just okay. My husband said the one he had on his walking tour was much better. Reserve in advance.  Nando’s – whenever I’m in the UK we have to go to Nandos! We don’t have them here and I love their rainbow bowl. Casual counter service but so good.  The Mustard Seed (Inverness) – people rave about this place but the food was just okay very small portions nice looking definitely book in advance they were also turning people away  Comfort Food For Any Mood (Dunkheld) – delicious fruit scones from this bakery. They were huge and yummy!  McKay’s (Pitlochry) – tried Cullen Skink soup for the first time and loved it. ,tatravelbug,Edinburgh,"New York City, New..."

Is it really rain and showers every day for 10 days. Is there a chance we won't see the sun for a minute for a solid week in the north of england/scotland? We are prepared for bad weather we understand it's not summer and are fine with some rain but the 10 day forecast has me drinking the single malt a wee bit early.    10 straight days where the forecast doesn't show a ray of sun? every single day is showers light rain heavy rain increasing rain etc. etc. Is this normal? Will we at least get some hours of not being rained on?    Talk me off the steep Scottish cliff please.    joking - but also kinda serious. lol. ,Can Do Traveler,Edinburgh,"Etowah, North..."
Sorry I can see this has been done to death but I still cannot find what I’m looking for.    Travelling from Sheffield over Woodhead to an event at the arena. Initially looked at park and ride but would rather park someone with a short journey in rather than the 40min journey from East Didsbury. From what I gather park and rides aren’t necessarily great at night anyway.    Looked at topics for parking near the arena but where it won’t be too problematic getting out. We don’t mind a short walk. Saw mention of some near HMP Manchester…are these still here? It’s been a few years since I’ve travelled to Manchester.    All suggestions welcome! ,LoonyWitch,Manchester,South Yorkshire

Hi all    I am planning a little trip to the UK at the end of this month and have allocated myself 4 nights in Scotland (Monday 30th- Friday 3rd) and was wondering where should I go/ what should I see ?    I'll arrive by ferry to Cairnryan Monday morning and will be heading to London on the Friday.  I'm solo travelling and want to be somewhere fun for halloween (i'm 21) however for my last couple days I would really enjoy going somewhere off the beaten track.    Also although Edinburgh is a must see I am visiting again in January so would be happy to skip it this trip so I can spend a bit more time elsewhere.    I'll also be travelling by public transport so any recommendations on where to go eat stay / what to see would be greatly appreciated!!

I am somewhat confused as to when I should tap the yellow stand-alone Oyster validators when changing trains with contactless or Oyster typically between National Rail and Transport for London services.    It seems to be required at Waterloo to/from the Waterloo and City Line.    When changing from DLR to Elizabeth Line at Custom House there is an obvious sign at the top of the escalator from the DLR telling you to touch out but the validator were hard to find. However Geoff Marshal says otherwise: https://youtu.be/VW-QjnwDVbw?si=Jw_J4DbsUr1nn-AT&t=90    But there are stations with stand-alone validators where it is apparently not required to use them when changing trains except when switching between Oyster/contactless and other National Rail tickets such as Stratford.    So when should I tap the yellow stand-alone Oyster validators when changing trains ,Timothy Baldwin,London,"York, United Kingdom"
Hi there    I will be travelling with my 75 year old mum (still very active) around the UK in September/October 2024. We have 4 days put aside to do Cornwall (coming from Bath). We will be relying purely on public transport or group tours to get around. We want to see St Michael's Mount the Lost Gardens of Heligan and St Ives but apart from that we are open to suggestions as to how to best set up our itinerary and where to base ourselves.    We love food history and architecture. We won't be doing any water sports bike riding or big hikes. We thoroughly enjoy walking tours around towns/villages and easy to access scenic sights/gardens.    Thank you ,Dianna H,Cornwall,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi  we are a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids-14108).  After a lot of trips around Europe we have decided to visit England.  we have bought plane tickets and will arrive in London (Luton) at the beginning of July.  We have 13 full days (15 in total but arriving late and leaving at noon so 2 days off).  As a couple we have been one week in London in the past so London is not a must.  I plan to rent a car (no problem with driving) for most/all of the time (depend if we will decide to stay in London).  I find it difficult to decide which parts of England to cover and need help from experts.  More about our vacation style and what we like.  We don't like long drives and also don't like changing locations of stay  so usually I choose 2-3 locations and travel around them like a star (up to 1.5 hour drive max and at least 2 nights in a location).  We like a little bit of everything - nature and short and easy hiking (up to 5 Km) castles nice villages and cities caves festivals views historic sites amusement and water parks (we less into arts with the kids).  Also we try to keep a budget so we don't stay at fancy places and a lot of the days cook and eat in. we also look for deals and limit and choose only 1-2 more expensive attractions (usually amusement parks).  Our daily routine is that we usually start the day around 8-9 a.m. and return around 6-9 p.m. (after a busy day there is a shorter day). So we cover a lot in one day.  I really need help to choose which areas we should visit and maybe if someone has an itinerary. I am not sure at all if we will visit London as I looked and the prices for a family of 5 are so high.  Also if you have any tricks to make the vacation cheaper (maybe coupons or a card that you pay and has a lot of attractions for free etc.).    Thanks ,nizani,England,San Francisco...

Hi we're planning a holiday up to Northern England next year staying in Newcastle for a couple of days and we'd pondered taking the train up to Berwick-upon-Tweed to get a photo op at the England-Scotland border with our daughters...but it seems that it's not as easily accessible as I'd thought! Buses seem to run only very infrequently from what I saw on Google maps and it's over an hour walk from the train station.

Can anyone confirm that these are legitimate and provide the service they advertise?    Thank you. ,retiredtripper,Cheltenham,"Woodstock, Illinois"

We'll be traveling one way from Edinburgh to London on October 14 and planning to buy advance tickets. Not sure what the difference is between Lumo and LNER and whether it should matter to us.

We plan to be in Edinburgh next August two of us. I am thinking of going to the Stirling games. Has anyone ever done something like a mini cabit both ways for a day? I will look into the train also.

The worst experience I have ever had with airport car parking company. A few days before we were due to fly they canceled the booking and changed it to meet and greet. This cost us more money. They did offer a full refund but I think they knew we would not do that as we had very little time to book an alternative car parking.  The ‘Friendly Driver’ was anything but friendly. When we arrived at the airport he told us to park in a disabled parking bay when I questioned this he shouted “ F****** park it there” He then demanded £40 in cash because we were 6 minutes late and said he would not take the car unless we paid him in cash. He was extremely rude and very offensive. We had no choice as we were due to fly in 3 hours time. He refused to give us a receipt. We then had to give him £6 to get out of the car park. In all the car parking cost us a lot more than other car parking companies and the service was extremely bad and I the staff extremely rude and offensive. I would have to say that the driver who returned the car on our return Martin was very polite and helpful. The originally paid £73 but it subsequently cost us £125.  However I will never ever use this company again and I will warn all my family and friend not to use this company. ,Babar M,Manchester,
Hi all I'm travelling later this month. Generally I love the outdoors nature and scenic and historical places. I don't mind some poor weather as I'm used to British weather and travel widely in Wales. I love hiking but I'm travelling by myself so probably won't be too ambitious. Some good coastal walks would be good. I'm wondering if my current itinerary flying into Edinburgh and out of Aberdeen could include any of the Highlands as technically I'm travelling in East of Scotland. I wouldn't mind a small detour or some day trips. However if the Aberdeenshire coast is interesting enough I wouldn't mind staying close to there. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. ,darrenlee9,Scotland,"London, United..."

I need to get from York to St James Hospital. I’m totally unfamiliar with Leeds and I’m wondering how difficult it’s going to be to drive (and park) at the hospital. Thinking maybe I should get train from York to Leeds and then a taxi from station to hospital. I’ll be having a minor procedure at the hospital so obviously car would be more convenient but I don’t want to feel stressed at the thought of driving in/out of Leeds when I don’t know the area.  I’d appreciate any advice.  Thank you ,lascaryork,Leeds,North Yorkshire...
Thanks all for your great food market suggestions. Now another question. While I shouldn't be surprised it looks like it's going to rain much of this week.    We're traveling with a toddler and our original plan was to go to parks and playgrounds in the morning. Are there any indoor activities that are open early in the morning specifically that are child friendly? In the U.S. most public libraries have free play areas - is that true in London too?    We will do all of the museums in the afternoons after kiddo's nap time. Looking for things that are open at 9am or so so we can go before noontime nap. We're staying in Kensington about halfway between Holland Park and Kensington Gardens. Happy to take the tube or bus places.    Thanks! ,nyc-to-ma,London,Somerville...

We will be spending 2 to 3 nights on Mull next summer. I'm need to book my overseas flight (using air miles) soon and am trying to figure out what weeks are best for our 2 1/2 total weeks in Scotland. We are keen to see puffins basking sharks and minke whales. I see puffins are there May-July and I think basking sharks and minke whales would be around in July. Originally we were thinking of coming in late June to see the puffins. Now we are thinking of being in Mull sometime between July 10-18th to try to see the puffins and the sharks and/or whales. Does that logic make sense? I do like the idea of going to Lunga and sitting amongst the puffins but I'm also loving the idea of being up close to the basking sharks. What 1 day tour operators do you recommend? We would go to Lunga or maybe Lunga/Staffa one day and then a whale and/or shark tour another day. My husband doesn't think he wants to do an extended 3-5 day tour to find the basking sharks. Of note we are also going to Skye but from what I have read I think our better chance of seeing these creatures are boats from Mull. Thanks for any insight you may be able to provide. ,Connie E,Isle of Mull,

Just spent five days in Soho staying at The Resident which was very good and difficult to fault.    What was not so good was the overall environment in Soho. I spent a decade between mid 60s to mid 70s working in and socialising in this area. Although there may be an element of rose coloured spectacles the area has degraded significantly. It was always a vibrant busy somewhat seedy area but now especially at weekends it’s a bit of a zoo with noticeably filthy streets and congested streets. Commissar Khan might perhaps direct his attention away from penalising motorists and cleaning up a the streets!    We spent 5 days at the beginning of a 4 week trip in Vienna where the cleanliness of the environment was a significant contrast to London. Also crossing Oxford St into the oasis of Fitzrovia for dinner one evening was literally a breath of fresh air!    Took Jasons narrow-boat to Camden Lock which was excellent Camden Market itself a seedy dump and better avoided. ,rwlid,London,"Perth, Australia"
Good morning everyone please bear with me but I was unable to find an answer to my doubts ...  My daughter will be in London Friday arriving at Gatwick Airport in the evening. She wants to catch the Southern Railways train to Victoria Station but ... in the ticket booking page there is an option to pay by Oyster or Contactless (which she already registered for) with Pay as you go and it is some 8 pounds cheaper (roundtrip) than booking and paying the ticket on the website.  We don't understand how it works: if you buy the ticket on the Southern Railways website you have to choose a time for your train(s) while if you want to use the Pay-as-you-go option you don't have to book anything? I mean you just go to the station and use your card to pay at the moment? What if there are no available seats on the train? Thank you in advance for your help! ,targheauto,London,"Volano, Italy"

Dear Tripadvisor network    Me and my husband are planning to visit Cornwall/Devon/Dorset beginning of September 2024 for two weeks and I’m looking for the perfect itinerary. There is so much to see and I have trouble to define where to spend how much time. We will stay in hotels/B&B and as foodies prefer to stay in places with good restaurants. We are looking at an itinerary that would have a combination of pretty villages scenic walks along the coast and gardens.    This is a basic “skeleton” I've got so far based on my research:    *Start roundtrip on Sunday September 1st 2024/Finish on September 15th at Newquay airport / pick up rental car    *Villages/places I identified based on my search are:  Padstow Bedruthan Steps Tintagel Castel Stonehenge Salisbury Old Harry Rocks Durdle Door/Lulworth Cove Chesil Beach Weymouth Dartmouth Looe Polperro Eden Project The Lost Gardens of Heligan Charlestown Trelissick Garden Trebah Garden Lizard Point St Michaels Mount Mousehole Penzance Minack Theatre Lands End Cape Cornwall St Ives    I’m lost at identifying:  *Should we do the roundtrip clockwise or counterclockwise?  *Places to choose as a base (Which villages are charming and have good restaurants)  *Where to spend how much time.  *St Ives seems to be a pretty village. Should we stay there overnight or only do a day trip?    If someone has a detailed itinerary (day by day) with description drive time stay time .. and would make it available to me please let me know.    I would be super grateful for any ideas and insights!!! ,Rosa1213,Cornwall,"Zurich, Switzerland"

Hello  After big plans to travel to Spain and Portugal I watched a YouTube on canal boating in Wales and decided I don’t want to travel so much.  I have looked at different hire companies and they all seem to have good reviews so my question is where or who do I look to for trip planning. We have 3 weeks blocked for a holiday in February- March. Some places don’t start until March other’s late February.  All I want to do is coast a long the river eat at pubs beside the canal walk to nearby sites (shops castles quaint towns) and relax.  Awaiting in anticipation for some pointers.

We are flying in to Glasgow from the US. We will arrive on a Friday early afternoon in May. The next day we will be picking up a rental car and heading to Glencoe for a night. I have a couple of questions:    1. What area of town should we stay for the night? We will want a good meal and to walk around a while to try and adjust to the jet lag.    2. Is there a better place to pick up a car than the airport? I've heard Arnold Clark is a good company but I don't know where the operate out of.    3. Depending on where you recommend we stay where would be a good place to eat? Nothing fancy but a pleasant atmosphere would be nice. A pub would be fine. Music would be good too but I know it usually starts late. We will probably crash early so I'm not expecting to find any.    Thanks for your help  Linda ,SunFun999,Glasgow,"Palm Bay, Florida"

Good morning    I am organising a hen weekend for March 2024 and we have beautiful accommodation booked and some lovely activities. However one of the wish list things is a Spa or spa treatment.    The problem we have is there are 22 of us! I have previously contacted the Monart Spa at Poundbury who were unable to accommodate us. Now I'm wondering if it would be better to get a team of milobile therapists in.    My initial search has only turned up solo therapists.    Can anyone suggest either a Spa we could visit that could fit all of us in or a company with possibly 4 or 5 therapists that could come to us?

Hello!  we have been searching for last 2 weeks for a place to stay in Londong around 27Dec-02Jan for 2 adults and 2 kids.  We have been travelling a lot last 2 decades and thus we are comfortable in searching and making arrangements. However for this trip i came to a dead-end...  Is Londong really so expensive during christmas time? Usually last few years we could find decent hotels in central locations for around 200 EUR per night but now i cant find anything. Everything is so expensive that seems that we would need to go around 1 hour away from center to find a more reasonable price for that period.    Am i doing something wrong or indeed the prices are so high? Maybe we should try somewhere in central Europe for our xmas vacations?    Thanks! ,fekish,London,Greece

Hello All    I'm in the early stages of planning a short trip to London early next year and would greatly appreciate the help of this forum to narrow down my search for a hotel. To give some context my husband and I are in our mid-thirties and we'll be spending only 3 nights in London in early March (March 1-4). Given the short duration of our stay I'd really like to ensure that our hotel is close to as much of what we're planning to see as possible to make the best use of our time. Some of the things I already have on my list of attractions are the British Museum Westminster Abbey Elizabeth Tower the Tower of London and then of course just general wandering through the streets on foot to shop/eat. Some other details in case they're helpful for suggestions - we're arriving by train into St. Pancras Station and we'll be departing out of Heathrow. We don't travel that often so I'm willing to splurge a bit on the hotel budget though ideally not more than 400-500 GBP per night.    After doing some initial research on TA and in guidebooks I feel like somewhere in the West End would make the most sense for us but I know there are so many sub-areas there that each have their own positives and negatives. It seems like Soho has a lot going on but maybe one of the surrounding areas would be a bit quieter to stay in? Any recommendations for either specific areas that sound like they would fit the bill here or even specific hotels to check out would be greatly appreciated! Much thanks in advance! ,TravelingGT1,London,"Portland, Oregon"

Hello all    Help me make a decision. We are a family of four (kids aged 2 and 6) going to London for the first time.    Tower Suites is a 5 star in Tower Hill. Room is a 1 bedroom with laundry ensuite and a nicer breakfast from what I hear. Cheaper than PP studio.    PP Westminster is by Waterloo station but we'd only be budgeting for a studio and there is no laundry and the breakfast appears very average. The location is super nice walkable and there's lots of playgrounds nearby. Also the rail to Southhampton is next door (we promised w would take the kids to the Peppa Pig Theme Park).    Is Tower Hill really a bad or lame area? Does it feel safe at night? ,Sruti G,London,
I will be arriving to LHR at 10:15am on 9/15/23 which is Friday. I am staying in a hotel in Bayswater London. My question is which would be more cost effective UBER or private car service through Transfeero? The car service company is giving me a quote of $94.34 which includes VAT fees and tip. How much would UBER cost in comparison? I am traveling solo and do not want to take the express train. Thanks in advance for the information. ,SouthernCalifornia,London,West Hollywood...

Hello. I seem to be a bit confused about the options i have to go from Luton airport to london. Final destination is Bethnal green but i need firstly to see what options do I have to go to a central place in London and then i will take the metro to Bethnal green. So what are the options? I saw about bus line 757 also teravision buses also national express buses. Also train. But do they go directly from luton airport? Or do the start from luton parkway. If so only way to get to luton parkway is with DART? And is DART free if i have a ticket for train or bus? ,navis84,London,"Athens, Greece"
Hi all  We're looking at a 12 night (maximum !) road trip for next June - driving from English Midlands so have to allow suitable transit times. We don't like staying in one place for too long and are looking for some variety - but the centre-piece of this trip is meant to be the Outer Hebrides which we've never been to before. Here's what I have so far:    Day 1: long drive North stop somewhere simple probably just north of Glasgow.  Day 2: drive to Glencoe pm touring stay ... where exactly?  Day 3: possibly another walk in the Glencoe area in the morning (depending on the weather!) then drive to Skye/Portree.  Day 4: on Skye  Day 5: ferry to Harris/Lewis to stay ... where? Tarbet?  Day 6: Harris/Lewis  Day 7: Harris/Lewis  Day 8: drive/ferry to Uist to stay ... where?  Day 9: on Uist  Day 10: ferry to Mallaig and then on to Pitlochry  Day 11: Pitlochry  Day 12: leave first thing to spend day and evening in Edinburgh  Day 13: drive home    The Glencoe (on the way out) and Pitlochry (return) are just meant to be constructive stops rather than major destinations. Are there better places to break those journeys? (looking for places where there are good walks and preferably dining options).  I've also read that Edinburgh isn't a great place to take a car but we have no choice in that matter. What's the best workaround? Looking for good midrange hotels generally.    All suggestions gratefully received. ,Loddonlily,Scotland,Great Malvern...
Hi  Hoping to take my 10 year old son (this weekend) for some VR fun in London but all the experiences I can see online are immersive experiences with a few fixed games to choose from free roaming stuff etc. Does anyone know anywhere with a wide selection of games where he can just essentially be given a VR headset and a list of games to choose from? Probably a bit less hi-tech than most of the stuff on offer he likes to choose games he knows and to swap around rather than one experience for the full time.

Hi - we are over in UK in December and we've booked an advance ticket return train journey from Manchester to Liverpool on an East Midland Railways service. When purchasing (which I did directly with EMR) it talked about seat reservation being included in the ticket but the actual ticket just says to sit in any vacant unreserved seat.    Just wondering if this is because all seats on that particular service are unreserved? Also I assume that if there are no free seats then we'll need to stand for the journey?    (Apologies if this seems a silly set of questions but I've only used metro style services before so haven't experienced the intercity travel type situation) ,Richard B,Manchester,"Wellington, New..."

If basing at Oak Tree Inn in Balmaha for 2 nights I can see there is a ferry from Sweeney Cruises that leaves twice a day to Luss with a return (Sweeney departs Balmaha 11:50 & 15:50 and Departs Luss 12:25 and 15:55). However if we want to go to Inchcailloch Island for a walk which cruise or ferry company does that with a return to Balmaha? I can't find a site that lists the company and the departure times. It would be great if we could leave Balmaha earlier than 11:50 do the shorter walk on the island and then go to Luss to see the church and do the historical walk before heading back to Balmaha but I'm unsure that's possible in a day.    As an alternate if we wanted a boat ride (with no stops) that brings us around a larger part of the lake do any companies leave from Balmaha and return or should we drive to Ballach or Luss and take a Sweeney Cruise? We wouldn't of course do all these things with our limited time but I'm trying to get an idea of what's possible; so we can choose. Thanks so much for your input! ,Connie E,Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park,

Hoping someone can offer some advice please.    For our Holiday in January 2024 my wife and I are flying from Heathrow Terminal 3 to Male Via Dubai.    Our flight leaves Heathrow Terminal 3 @20:00 and we arrive back into Heathrow at 22:00 10 days later.

Wondering if anyone has advice on the best way to plan this. I want it to be as straightforward as possible when I arrive back into Heathrow and also worried about getting back to the hotel late at night if the flight gets delayed for any reason.    Any advice on options would be much appreciated. ,Robert S,London,United Kingdom

There is currently a major fire at Luton Airport in the number 2 Multi Storey Carpark. I’ve heard lots of fire engines and several distant loud bangs.    https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-67073446    Flights have been suspended and access to the airport restricted if anyone has plans to fly tomorrow you might want to check with your airlines.  Many people who have parked their cars will be returning to find them destroyed as 80% of the carpark is alight. What a terrible way to finish a holiday.

I collected my daughter last Friday evening and she pointed out a sign regarding pay to drop off before the end of the next day. my daughter took a photo and of course I promptly forgot till today. I logged on added a password and gave my bank details as prompted but no mention of how much I was to pay - - it went through my bank security. Looked at the photo again and it appears I will be getting a penalty notice for £100 reduced to £60 if I pay within 14 days... Had my daughter not pointed this out I would absolutely have missed this. I have just received an email saying that my car is now ready for auto pay at Gatwick....  I wonder if this is a new system? has anyone else had a penalty notice for forgetting to pay £1? ,Magda Devaris,London,

This is what I am thinking so far. Any comments would be greatly appreciated.    I was thinking of a June 2024 trip. Late enough for the weather to have improved (all relative) but early enough not to be too crowded.    Newark (EWR) to EDI. Looks like British Airways is my best best given my Amex points.  Connecting at LHR.    Three nights in Edinburgh so two full days.    Rent a car at EDI. Drive to Nairn. Why Nairn? On the way sort of to the west coast. I want to go to Skye but seems like that is not doable in one day. Two nights in Nairn.    Nairn to Skye. Four nights on Skye (stay in Portree?). Alternatively three nights in both Nairn and Skye but I get the sense from the forums that an extra night on Skye at the cost on one extra night in Nairn is a good trade-off. Does that make sense?    Skye to Glencoe. Three nights in Glencoe.    Glencoe to a hotel at EDI with departure next day. I suppose that depends on when my flight out will be but given it looks like 2 1/2 hours from Glencoe to EDI not sure it makes sense to go directly from Glencoe to EDI for a same day departure. Alternatively stay the night before the flight out in Stirling which looks like it is only 45 miinutes away from EDI. The propsect of staying in an airport hotel the night before departure feels like a bad way to end a beautiful trip.    Any comments would be greatly appreciated. ,Rschleng,Scotland,"Hoboken, New Jersey"
Hello all  Me and my friends are planning to travel to London next week - for just a week and were planning to get cheap and value for money sim cards.

Hi everyone!    I'll be visiting the Costwold area for the first time with my extended family and would love some insight on what it's like during the holiday season. We plan on renting an Airbnb starting Dec 23rd when will stay until the 26th/27th.    Additionally my birthday is actually on Boxing Day (Dec 26) so personally I'd love to be able to take the day off from my relatives and do something with my partner. So in that case would it be advised that we rent a car so we can explore the area? We were initially planning on taking a bus from Cotswold to Bristol/Bath for a couple of days but realized that it will be tricky getting a bus on a Boxing Day. Another note is that my partner and I will be visiting from the US. My partner is a terrific driver but have never driven in the UK before.    Thank you so much for all the advice! ,yackandrach,Cotswolds,

Hi all    I will be on the Isle of Man in July 2024. I plan to spend an entire Saturday morning + afternoon in Laxey but I am having trouble researching the attractions.    From what I can tell I can take either the Manx Electric Railway or the #3 bus from Douglas to Laxey in the morning and since it is a Saturday I can take the Great Laxey Mine Railway from somewhere near the electric railway station right to the Great Laxey Wheel. That much is clear.    What's much less clear is what to do after that. There are multiple references to being able to enter part of a mine somewhere ner the Great Laxey Wheel (and the Manx Heritage brochure has a photo of a family in a mine wearing hard hats) and lots of references to a Mines Trail. But googling these terms has no results; looking them up on Google Maps has no results. All I get is results about the short tunnel that the Great Laxey Mine Railway passes through.    Anyone have more information? ,Bruce A,Isle of Man,Washington DC...

This was my solo museum marathon day.    Leisurely walk to British Museum arrived around 9:45 for 10 am opening and shocked that 200 people had same idea and in queue. Once it opened queue moved very fast and I think they ALL went to the Rosetta Stone which I had already seen on Friday. Went straight to Parthenon Marble Sculptures and had the whole place to myself. I took my time worked my way through Assyrian Egyptian (less crowded than Friday). Spend at least 2.5 hours then walk to National Gallery.    Again skipped the tiny line with booked ticket that no one checked. I took my time not crowded at all made sure I did all the rooms. By this time legs were sore and took tube to Imperial War Museum.    I had very high hopes being a WW 1&2 buff and felt a bit disappointed at the entrance floor with the replica displays but it kept getting better and better and the Holocaust section was both emotionally exhausting and amazing in its size and detail. Really very very well done.    Packed Tube back to King’s Cross with some riders unable to get in. Family now making their way back after a Bills loss which again reinforced my decision to choose museums over that.    Headed to Rome early tomorrow. I am very grateful for all the detailed help from all the London Experts. My only advice is don’t waste time booking museum time entries not a single one was needed. ,MarkFromBuffalo,London,"Buffalo, NY"

Please share any other info about the area recommended taxi companies or safety concerns I should keep in mind. Thank you in advance. ,katyinct,Manchester,Connecticut
Hello    I’ll be in London from 20.10 to 24.10. Coming at Gatwick airport around 11am.    1) Where to buy sim cards and how much they cost? (i need mobile data for 5 days)    2) Is thameslink to West Hampstead included in pay as you go cap or you need to pay it seperately?    3) If i have for example. 8 rides in a day from zone 1 to zone 3 then to zone 2 and to zone 4. then i need to pay at the end of the day £11.70 for pay as you go cap (zone 1->4)?    That’s all for now. Thank you all! ,David Valant,London,"Celje, Slovenia"

Hi we are going to be in the Lake District in June for about 4 days. We are looking to stay in a cute town that has access to decent hikes (not huge hikers) and good food- Michelin starred or similar level as well as charming pubs.    We may or may not have a car (will depend on where we end up staying). I was focusing on amberside and grasmere but is there anywhere better? Windermere and keswick seem too busy ,amandarez,Lake District,"Richmond, Virginia"
I used Rail Ninja to book a ticket from York to Edinburgh with a seat selection. They emailed me there was a delay in completing due to seat assignment. I've received the confirmation now and am trying to figure out what the seat assigned will look like but looking online at the seat maps for the different trains is confusing.    Wondering if anyone can help. It is LNER seat A36 on November 19 at 12:31 but cannot determine the train in order to know if I'm looking at the correct layout.    It appears to be an aisle seat and potentially facing backward but cannot be sure I'm looking at the right thing. If that is the seat it is disappionting as it tells me no changes can be made as well. Any help would be very much appreciated! ,Voyage759894,England,Fort Bragg...
My husband and I want to do a road trip in Scotland next year and we have around three weeks to do this. We will be flying into Aberdeen and picking up a car and driving to Inverness via Cullen. We will then do the north coast 500 after this we will drive onto Fort Williams. Not sure after this but thinking maybe driving to Oban the onto Lochgilphead then onto Dumbarton. This is again where we get stuck we will be flying out of Glasgow. We have been to Edinburgh a couple of times so we haven’t planned on going here.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you ,S Smith,,Blue Mountains...

We are traveling from Boston Dec 26- Jan 1 with our 2 daughters 15 & 13 and have booked the St Ermin's Hotel b/c of it's location (and service appears to be good). Most other hotels I have looked into are booked. Is this going to be a good location for us? It seems just the walkability will be great. We definitely enjoy being able to walk to dinner (any recs nearby?) but I'm just looking for some reassurance that this will be a good spot for our 1st trip to London (only my husband has been).

Hi  Thanks in advance.  I have looked to book an airport lounge at Manchester the 1903 lounge is ruled out as we have a 7 year old traveling with us.  The Manchester airport website gives one other option - the escape lounge however there appears to be another called aspire - but I can't find ANYTHING about this on the Manchester airport lounge booking site. I'm confused because a search for aspire lounges via good old Google says there is an aspire lounge.  Is this the case? And if so why isn't it advertised with the others?  Also (if indeed there is the option) which one would be best?  Cheers :) ,Thethingreenline,Manchester,

I have an international flight leaving LHR at 9am on 27 Oct from Terminal 3. Since I'm visiting London and would love to stay in the city as much as possible and my hotel in London is near Stratford I have the option of either 1) staying in the Stratford hotel the night of 26 Oct and trying to get to the airport early in the am or 2) getting a hotel night near LHR for the evening so that I'm not rushing it. I did some research and it seems like it would be best to book an airport hotel for the night?    If I do get a hotel at LHR would Aerotel be the best bet? ,superkathy,London,San Diego...

Hello    My family (2 adults & a 2 year old boy) are going to spend December 12-29th in London. Our thoughts are to have an Airbnb as a base perhaps in Covent garden area (open to other area suggestions). Then we would like to take a couple trips out of the city by train specifically to other Christmas-y and walkable areas. After my initial research I’m thinking of going to York for 2 nights and I saw that Eurostar goes direct to Lille France (not interested in Paris) so we would spend 1-2 nights there. I suppose I’m looking for advice and if anyone can recommend if there is any places you say are a must do with a toddler that time of year. What places are easy and worth it to go by train. Thank you in advance 🙏🏼 ,Shannon J,London,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

Hi  We were scheduled to stay in Oban from 7-9 oct and onwards to Isle of Skye until the 12th. After the weather conditions we had to turn back ( an hour before reaching Oban) and now staying the night at Doubletree by Hilton Westerwood. It was the only property we could find and frankly after the day we had it feels good to get a roof over the head right now.  Coming to the next few days-  We had hired a car and have it until 12th evening.  There is still the problem of figuring out where to stay as all our carefully laid plans have been tossed.  What can we do with the next few days?  We do have a car BUT have lost the urge to drive longer distances after today..(we did a full circle back to Edinburgh almost before realising there was no place available where we could spend the night so stopped at Westerwood).  Welcome suggestions on itinerary and stay options.  We are husband wife and 7 year old daughter. Have travelled after spending a week in London ( did the zoo parks and museums there).  Thank you members. ,Ankitfrenz,Edinburgh,"Noida, India"
Hello All -  We are in the preliminary planning phases of a potential trip to London in early to mid Oct 2024. It would be our first time traveling overseas with our kids who will be 8 & 5 at the time. I have been to London before but would be the first time for the rest of the family. At this point in planning I'm trying to put together rough costs & determine the right duration for the trip. A very preliminary itinerary is below and I'd appreciate input on if the days are too full too empty or about right. Thanks in advance for your guidance (and perhaps some encouragement at the idea of international travel from the US with two elementary school aged kids!)    Day 1: Arrive in AM from US Diana Memorial Playground Kensington Gardens/Palace (outside) Hyde Garden    Day 2: London Transportation Museum Peppa Pig Afternoon Tea Bus Tour w/ Bridgit's Bakery    Day 3: Shakespeare's Globe Theater family tour Golden Hinde Harry Potter Walking Tour Sky Garden (dinner)    Day 4: Fun London Changing of the Guards Tour Royal Mews Westminster area (Westminster Abbey Big Ben Parliament - view outsides only) Southbank / Queens Walk (London Eye or Golden Carousel?)    Day 5: Greenwich via Thames Clipper    Day 6: Tower of London Tower Bridge (museum)    Day 7: Hampton Court Palace by train    Day 8: Trafalgar Square National Portrait Gallery Leicester Square (film statues; Lego store) British Museum    Day 9: Fly home ,MnMallyAnn,London,Minneapolis...

We will be visiting our daughter at Keele University in December. We are arriving in Manchester Airport on a Thursday and are contemplating staying at the Courtyard Marriott on campus. We have a flight scheduled out of London Gatwick on Saturday at 1PM to Venice Italy. It was originally out of Manchester but flight was cancelled by the airport. We need to figure out the best way to get from Keele University to Gatwick Airport. Trains/buses seem to look like a pain with our luggage. There will be four of us traveling. I'm a bit confused as to how long a car trip would take. Looks like 3.5 hours. I'm trying to decide if it is best to taxi or to rent a car. Taxi would be very expensive but this would be our first time driving on the left side in a vehicle but husband is a competent driver. Daughter is studying abroad this semester and has only been there about 3 weeks now and knows her way around using buses/trains from the university to Manchester but has not yet been to London. We will later be back in London to explore for five days and would then need to get back to Manchester for a flight home. We know to not drive a rental in London nor in Manchester. What car rental places near Keele University would be good and also near London for our way back to Manchester. We would like to explore the countryside near Manchester for a few days as well prior to returning to Manchester airport. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ,Melissa P,,"Asheboro, North..."
Thank you in advance for any suggestions!

We usually go to Cornwall (Fowey) but haven’t the time to get away to make the long drive worthwhile. Something similar to that in Yorkshire would be perfect!

Hello - we'll be in York in a couple weeks and plan to visit the Minster and climb the tower. We arrive in york by train on a weekday afternoon and are staying close to the Minster and wonder if we can purchase Minster tickets for that arrival day in York - and just pop in for a look/walk around - but have our main visit be the next morning and do the tower trip on the 2nd day. Is there any restriction on the tower trip needing to be on the day of our first entry/ticket with time - or can it be on the 2nd day of entry (as you can re-enter as many days as you wish for up to a year correct?)?    Since we're staying so close and if time allows I'd like to enter on arrival afternoon - and then save the more focused/longer visit for day 2 + tower trip. We'll be right there and if we can get checked in etc. it would be fun to pop in on day 1 arrival afternoon - time permitting. I guess if we have some travel delay and miss our ticketed slot - could that be a problem for entering the next day? Is there any risk of day 2 time slots being sold out and us not being allowed to re-enter when we wish to? thanks! ,DC_Virginia_Traveler,York,Washington DC...

We're coming to Oban for a few days in early/mid October (probably about Oct 13 - 15). Based on a response I saw to another post I thought something like this might be a good idea...    https://westcoasttours.co.uk/book-tour/three-isles-tour-mull-iona-staffa/    Upon further research it looks like this trip stops running about a week before we arrive - which then begs the question is it advisable/possible to visit a few of the islands that late in the season? I'm just wondering if West Coast Tours shuts things down around then because the demand is just so low it's not profitable - or is it more of a case of by then the weather could turn too cold and/or the seas could be too rough and/or enough things on the islands have shut down for the season by then that it wouldn't be worth a visit?    We're coming from the U.S. and only arriving a few days before - so by the time we get from Glasgow to Aberdeen to pick up our daughter hire a car and then make our way over to Oban we can't really push the trip up any sooner to be in season if that's a thing. Should we just skip the thought of taking in a few islands that late in the season or would it still be worthwhile?    Thanks in advance...    Tim ,Tim S,Oban,Saint Paul...

Quick breakfast then Tube to Tower Hill ten minute wait at ticket office they checked my inbound tickets and we got the 241 for 4 people and one discounted senior ticket for £26.    Quick line at entry and I marched our party of 5 straight to Crown Jewels over constant howling complaints I wasn’t letting anyone stop and see anything else. Made it at 10 and no lines at entry to Crown Jewels. Everyone loved it and we were there a long time by the time we got out the lines were insane all the way to other side of White Tower. I loved all the gun and armor displays at the other exhibits.    Walked over Tower Bridge to Borough Market what an insane scene but Bread Ahead was super organized and very fresh donuts they kept replenishing. All the food was very fresh I got the amazing Tel Aviv street food they got Thai Japanese and Indian to go. We did what was suggested and took food to grass outside Tate Modern. Not impressed with Tate Modern some really over the top stuff for my taste.    Gorgeous walk to London Eye half hour early for our 241 tickets prepaid tickets but they just waved us through no checking of train tickets here.    Walked back to see Globe from outside and took pedestrian bridge which the kids said was in Harry Potter. Walked to St Paul Cathedral to end our day.    Great use for the dummy tickets 241 thank you to all for all the great suggestions. I am decoupling from them tomorrow as they head to Tottenham Stadium I will be at British Museum at 10 hope to beat the crowds then National Gallery again then Imperial War museum. ,MarkFromBuffalo,London,"Buffalo, NY"
Hi guys  I am planning our trip to England beginning of June 2024. My main draws are beautiful gardens nature hiking and of course history.  My dream is to stay at hotels/B&Bs/vacation rentals with beautiful gardens. Can anyone recommend such a place? Here are the approximate locations we will use as bases:  Winchester  Costwolds  Peak District  Lake District  Yorkshire Dale's  Possibly Wales on the coast    Thank you for any suggestions! ,Yuliya486,England,"Michigan, United..."
We will be in London next February to see Cirque de Soleil in the Royal Albert Hall. It’s our first visit to the hall though we have been to London a few times.  We have booked a Sunday evening show. We will likely be staying over near Borough Market.  We can’t decide where to dine it being a Sunday. We know that there are various restaurants in the hall and are wondering if they are good or tourist traps. Or if there are good restaurants nearby which we could visit and make the whole day a great experience.  We like most cuisine’s ,hxdirect,London,"Lisburn, United..."
We have a couple of nights in Inverness in early November Wednesday 1st and Thursday 2nd.    I was looking at staying at the Mercure in their Privilege room. The problem is that those rooms have either a riverside or cityside view. I don't care about the view as much but reading TA and Google reviews they all say that staying on the city side is incredibly noisy due to the proliferation of bars and pubs in the street.    I have attempted to contact the hotel to ask if we can be guaranteed a riverside room but have not had any reply which is disappointing.    Is it likely to be as noisy mid-week in November? I would imagine that most of these reviews date from the peak season and I would hope that things are quieter in November.    Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this. ,djh1,Inverness,"Melbourne, Australia"
I will be staying in York and want to catch a train to London.  What is the quickest way to walk to the station. Is it even walkable..never been to York but I have read that it's a bit compact.

Hi all    We are a group of three travelling to Scotland in August 2024 - We have 7 days arriving on the evening of the 25th from Ireland and leaving the evening of September the 1st. The places we would each like to visit if possible in no particular order are Edinburgh Stirling Isle of Skye Inverness Aberdeen St Andrews Culloden Loch Lomond Loch Ness Eilean Donan Castle Cairngorms Fort William and Glencoe - now i know all of this isn't going to be possible in 7 days but i would love peoples input on the must sees and dos and the most realistic way to see what we can without tearing round in a mad rush - we would like to stay in different places rather than have a base as we will be driving a rental car so getting around wont be an issue. If it makes more sense to stay in one place for a couple of days we are happy to do so. We are in our 40s with our main interests being the history of Scotland and the scenery. My husband also wants to visit Buchanan Castle and we would like to have a nights accommodation in a Castle so any recommendations for that would be awesome too. Our budget is flexible but would prefer mid-range. Look forward to hearing from you all thanks! :) ,Laina35,Scotland,

Traveled into London via Chiltern Rail into Marylebone station after a beautiful week in Stratford upon Avon. Had to change at Dorridge by crossing a climb-up-one-side-and-down-the -other platform with my 19 kg bag because the lift (is always) broken. Character building. 9:08- 11:40 time and pleasant enough journey otherwise.    Taxi from the rank charged £ 12 to take us to the family owned and unpretentious Celtic Hotel for our two night stay. We had stayed there several times in the 90s. Tiny but perfectly adequate en suite room for £150 per night great breakfast included. One flight of stairs to our room. No lift. Dropped our bags and headed outside walking Southampton to Holborn to catch the Tube to Bank for our planned lunch visit to Darwin's at Sky Garden.    As soon as we emerged we could see the walkie talkie and simply walked toward it. Our reservation took us straight up and we spent two hours over lunch and exploring. Fabulous. My third visit and it still knocks me out.    Caught the Tube and walked a short distance to the National Portrait Gallery for our four o'clock time slot. First visit since the renovation and we were so pleased and impressed. Stayed until closing walked around the area had gelato for dinner and caught Mike Birbiglia in The Old Man and the Pool. This one man show was funny and poignant and he held the audience in the palm of his hand throughout. We headed back to Russel Square in the Tube to do a close inspection of the challenges we would face if we took the Tube to Heathrow Thursday morning. Main obstacle was a set of 19 stairs with heavy wheelie bag. Our optimism grew. Picked up some snacks at Tesco and popped around the corner to our hotel. Quick showers and so to bed. Next thing we knew it was breakfast time.    This was my most nostalgic part of staying at the Celtic: breakfast in the high-ceilinged large windowed breakfast room. A pleasant woman waited on us for our delicious full English and she toasted our large granary slides in front of us and served them hot and crispy on a toast rack. We were set for hours. We walked to the British Museum for opening and spent an hour chasing down our favourite exhibits then headed to Covent Garden where we explored several shops and old haunts. I fancy myself a flower photographer and there was no end of inspiration. Tasted tea at Whittards bought a slice to tide us over then walked Trafalgar Square to Westminster Bridge for views and photos before .escaping crowds inside St. James Park. Leisurely stroll to the palace then back along the mall through the Square.  Back on the Tube we once again imagined handling our bags for the journey to the airport. Changed for the theatre and once again headed for Leicester Square where we saw Mark Rylance in Dr. Semmelweiss. My travel companion and I had first met the actor in 1989 in Stratford upon Avon when he came to our Shakespeare: Text and Theatre class. Subsequently we have seen him in several roles. We are huge fans. This play was not our favourite but we very much enjoyed its message . We walked quickly to the Tube. Side note: at least four different shop keepers and our waiters commented how quiet London is at the moment.    Our final arrival at Russell Square convinced us we two elderly females could handle the trip the following morning. So we topped off our Oyster cards grabbed some snacks at Tesco and walked around the corner for our final sleep in London. We packed our bags except for our morning necessities because we wanted to be out the front door by 7 which we managed.  The lift part was fine and not terribly busy. Our descent with our cases down the staircase was graceless and loud but in no time at all we were at the end of the platform ready to board the train to Heathrow. Stashed our bags stop each other and claimed our seats. Uneventful journey but I found the escalator upon our arrival at T3 a bit challenging. Nonetheless we were soon dropping our bags at the Virgin counter and after one last pass through security claimed seats for a wonderful breakfast at eln ( Eat Love Nosh) where our serviets bore the greeting You're the sweetest which my companion said should be revised to sweatiest True enough.    My friend and I will turn a very large number in November and we have a combined weight of 220 pounds so we do not take up a great deal of space. As we live on opposite coasts  this was probably our last trip together to the UK but it was every bit as wonderful as ever and we are very glad we made the effort to relive some of our favourite memories and very grateful to have had the chance. Thanks for all your help and advice. ,FineMind,London,Meadow Lands...
We have a longish daytime layover following a transatlantic flight and before our Oslo flight on a seperate ticket in February 2024. We land ( 0600) and depart ( around 1900) from South Terminal. Was looking at Yotelair but reluctant to book as flight might be delayed and don’t want to commit too early. Ideally would like to arrive with a plan as I might be catatonic after no sleep. How likely would it be that the Yotelair was full? Any other hotels that are walkable to South Terminal you would recommend. ,Sara C,Crawley,"Wellington, New..."

I'll be coming to Staithes next Spring and I wanted to know about the accessibility of the cliffs above Cowbar Bank. It appears there's a sort of footpath at the the top of the road at the big bend directly above the sea (before it drops down to the Beck). That path seems to meander across the shrubbery. I'm hoping that this high-up land is open to the public as I could imagine there's some excellent views looking down to the old village & Beck. Can anyone please confirm this for me. Thanks.

I'm visiting Orkney for the first time at the beginning of October. We're getting to the mainland via flight (I hate flying as it is - due to claustrophobia and anxiety - but I'd rather that than take the ferry because I hate boats!). Reason being I have emetophobia and boats terrify me because I'm scared I'll get seasick. I've never got seasick before (probably because I've never dared to go on a boat that has much of a chance of it). Being called the Orkney Islands I'd like to do some island hopping and I've already comitted to going to Hoy as I really want to go and it's a relatively short and straight forward trip (though I'm still terrified it will be choppy especially since I'm going in autumn). My dad really wants to go to Sanday and Egilsay (I'd love to go to North Ronaldsay one day but maybe that can wait until I'm a bit more confident with ferries and flying). I digress.    To get to my main question; I've looked around on the internet and I can't find anything about the ferries between the smaller isles in terms of the actual journey and how choppy it can be. All I get when I search for it is people saying how bad the ferry from Scrabster to Stromness can be (thank god we're flying!). What experiences have people had on ferries between the islands? Especially Sanday and Egilsay. Be honest! I really want to go with my dad (and the rest of my family too if I were to go) but if the journeys are prone to being choppy or causing sea sickness then I am NOT risking it :( .    Thanks ,Lydia,Orkney Islands,"England, United..."

Hi! We are arriving January 1st and I was wondering if any of the Christmas Lights will still be up and lit? Any of the trees and street decorations?

Also do the big stores like Fortnum & Mason and Harrods have sales on holiday decorations after the New Year? We are not heading there to shop but I would like to grab a few ornaments.

Not at all comfortable with our recent experience with Forge Meet & Greet parking at Bristol airport.    Using their website I booked a white Ford Transit van to be parked for a week over Christmas. I gave the make model and registration number and paid the resulting cost of £60. I subsequently received two confirmation emails both confirming the make and model of vehicle being dropped off.    When we arrived the Forge representative advised that they don’t park vans only cars. He claimed that the website advises anyone wishing to park vans should call in advance to find out the cost as their website doesn’t distinguish between cars and vans. This seems odd as the website asks for make and model which made me think they were giving me a price for the correct vehicle. (Having since checked there is no additional note advising users to call in advance.). When I explained this he relented to accepting the van but wanted to charge ‘at least’ an additional £30 - £40. I explained that this wasn’t acceptable and gave him the last £10 I had. I was stuck and didn’t really have time to argue.    Upon collection of the vehicle I noticed that the reversing camera had been disconnected. I queried this via text and was told that it is their ‘policy not to share with everyone where our secure lockups and car parks are as this information can be passed on to anyone’. I do not accept this explanation because the camera is situated at the rear of the vehicle so unless he reversed in would not show any location.    Very uncomfortable with the whole experience and would not recommend. Having read other reviews I wish I’d done my research better. ,Polly A,Bristol,"London, UK"

Hi I’m looking for honest opinions as I’m looking to potentially travel to Brighton and this would be my first time & something to tick off the bucket list I was reading different opinions though and some of them made me unsure and were concerning I just want to ask is Brighton a safe place to travel to for a day trip as i heard that there was some unsafe areas and that there were some elements of anti-social behaviour especially with fights happening and drugs being involved is there any areas that I should avoid? I would appreciate any advice as a tourist as I don’t want to walk into a bad situation & I would love to still explore Brighton and see it ☺️. ,Nomad T,,

Two questions here the first is simple is the 3 week processing time stated on the gov website realistic? We only have 3 weeks and 2 days between the flight and the appointment in the VAC but as detailed below this needs to be changed to over 4 weeks. Is it likely to be processed in time?    Second question so the visa is actually for my girlfriend traveling from South Africa to visit me in the UK. She included her flight dates on the application as the 7th of June. However I work away and have been extended by 1 week and will be home later. Therefore we are looking to changing her flights to the 13th of June instead. Is this going to cause any problem with the visa application? I read that flight tickets are not even necessary but as she has already submitted them I am concerned that changing the dates now will raise a red flag if they check her booking and the original no longer exists. Also don't wan to leave changing the flight too late as its already pretty close. Any advice much appreciated. :) ,Pathfinder585008,,
Greetings from Adelaide Australia!  I have finally booked my upcoming trip to Scotland in April/May next year. I will be based in Inverness from 2nd to 5th May (3 nights) and staying at the same guest house I stayed at with my Rabbie's tour back in 2019.    I really want to get to Glenfiddich Distillery/visit the speyside areas when I'm in Inverness but I can't find any tours that visit Glenfiddich. Most private tours are asking for $700 - $1000 (AUD) which is a little out of my budget.    My question to you all is:  1. What whisky tours do you recommend?  2. What do you think of catching public transport to the distillery from Inverness? (i have looked it up and find that I get a bus/train to elgin and then a bus to dufftown which stops at the distlllery).    I would appreciate your thoughts and ideas on the above.  Cheers  Rachel H ,Rachel H,Inverness,Hackham
This is an 11th hour request for help! We are on our way Monday evening to visit cousins in Surrey He and She H and S for short. Today we had a call from S; there has been a medical situation that MIGHT mean we will be elsewhere for a few nights. ( There is no need for further detail.)    So it could be that we spend a couple of days in London but are in need of hotel recommendations. Last year we stayed at Grange Beauchamp and prices are greatly increased. Our ambles would include V&A National Portrait Gallery Tate Britain and maybe Tate Modern. We are happy to walk for up to an hour but are comfortable using the tube. Price would be up to £250 per night but a lower cost would be preferable. Clean and comfortable is the top requirement.    This will all be moot if after conversation with S tomorrow things are more settled; but in case we opt to be in London your helpful recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

We arrived 7 am very quick immigration automated checked bags took a while the Piccadilly line to King’s Cross. Dropped our bags at King’s Cross Inn then ventured out.    English breakfast at Russell Park Caffe Tropea then British Museum and National Gallery with whole gang they asked for it and enjoyed it. No one checked the tickets.    Kept walking to Houses of Parliament and did Westminster Abbey 241 deal still pricey. Then walk to Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. Made full use of the Tube so happy the strike was called off. Dinner reservations at The Lamb tonight.    Tomorrow morning we start early with Tower of London then West Bank stroll after the dreaded stop at Borough Market.    I am very grateful for all the help from this forum. ,MarkFromBuffalo,London,"Buffalo, NY"
We are an older couple who plan to get to Southampton - for the cruise next day - from Bergen (Norway). The flight from Bergen to Gatwick is direct and significantly cheaper than the ones to SOU. The wisdom on this forum seems to be to take the train to Southampton and then taxi to hotel. Looks attractive but the thought of lugging our two suitcases plus one carry-on down stairs and into the compartment and out is daunting. How doable is it? And approx. how much would a car service be? And would it be readily available/bookable in advance? I know LHR-Southampton the traffic is substantial and regular but LGW?
