Countless tourists want to ‚Äúfeed the cute kangaroos & cuddle a koala‚Äù.    They are wild animals. Not toys. Not pets. We constantly tell people about places where they may be able to see them in the wild - AND TELL THEM NOT TO FEED ANY WILD ANIMAL.    This may deter a few of the smarter visitors & any idiot locals stupid enough to feed kangaroos.    http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-02/agro-kangaroos-addicted-to-carrots-attack-tourists/9716612    I just listened to someone on the radio who stopped a group of tourists from feeding McDonalds hamburgers to kangaroos in Morriset clearing mentioned above. What brain cell was in operation to feed that to a herbivore?    Apart from the danger to the humans ... far worse IMO they are endangering the health of the wild animals they feed. Soon enough one of those kangaroos will seriously hurt somone - and then there will be baying for its blood - and it will be killed by the rangers.    Just the same as happened with the dingoes that people fed against warnings on Fraser Island. A little boy was killed. That terrible tragedy need never have happened. But people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù to feed wild animals which become habituated to it and can & do become aggressive in the pursuit of junk food that is bad for them. Just like some humans!    In the case of the story in the link - I think there should be rangers on site-with $500 on the spot fines for anyone caught feeding those kangaroos. Its not practical to have ra gets at all the popular spots but perhaps if hefty enough fines were established it might be a deterrent.    I‚Äôm hoping that the inbound tour operators will pick up on this story and educate their customers that feeding anything let alone human ‚Äúfood‚Äù to animals is NOT ok. I doubt any will.    Perhaps we could put this link & story up as a ‚ÄúSticky‚Äù ,Bokhara,,Gold Coast...
https://www.facebook.com/kenny.jewell.9/posts/1015325015192908    Hi all  I came across this link on Facebook with some excellent photos and information regarding how to identify a rip and what to do if you are caught in one.  Unfortunately every year several tourists die on Australian Beaches usually thanks to their unfamiliarity with our ocean conditions.    Cheers all. Have a safe and happy 2016. ,sweetbiscuit21üèñüèï,,"Brisbane, Australia"
Australia is a land of huge contrasts ‚Äì geography sites and particularly weather. Currently South Australia is being battered by a monster storm parts of NSW are under water cyclone and stinger season approaches in the north and this weekend brings the start of the official bushfire season for much of the country.  Visitors should pay heed to the possibilities that weather related events will impact on their travel plans. By keeping updated on emergency events like flooding storms and bushfires you can minimise their disruption to your trip.  If you are on Facebook ‚Äì updates for these emergencies can be found at  NSW Rural Fire Service https://www.facebook.com/nswrfs/?fref=ts&rf=112647532118478  Vic Country Fire Authority https://www.facebook.com/cfavic/?fref=ts  SA Country Fire Service https://www.facebook.com/countryfireservice/?fref=ts    Useful websites include:  Bureau of Meteorology ‚Äì click the ‚Äòwarnings‚Äô tab at the right of the yellow bar at the top of the page http://www.bom.gov.au/?ref=hdr  Road closures in Victoria http://traffic.vicroads.vic.gov.au/  Road closures in NSW https://www.livetraffic.com/  Road closures in QLD https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/conditions/roadworks/road-closures/index.html  Road closures in SA http://traffic.sa.gov.au/  The warning however is always the same ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt need to be there ‚Äì don‚Äôt be there. Emergency service personnel (and a huge number of these are volunteers) are working to contain the fire mitigate the flood damage shore up properties against further damage etc. They are not there to rescue sightseers who thought it would be a good idea to go and have a look. Natural disasters are not tourist attractions ‚Äì DO NOT attempt to drive through flood waters or go anywhere near bushfires even if your GPS says you should go that way. It is not appropriate to visit fire-torn areas and look at destroyed homes. Once the emergency is over local businesses will welcome you back with open arms as they try to recover.  Please also remember that in summer when fires are a constant threat in many parts of the country the lighting of fires is banned on days of high risk. Please pay attention to Total Fire Ban signs which you will see on roadsides in fire-prone areas.  Please heed the advice and keep yourselves and our emergency personnel safe. We all want you to have a wonderful holiday and return home to your loved ones.

For those of you who followed our Two on a Train - Travelling North trip report you will be aware that Byron Bay was the final destination on the road trip down and where my good friend Bokahara said adie and headed off home.    If you didn‚Äôt see our ramblings on the thread is here https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g255055-i120-k14583132-Two_on_a_Train_Travelling_North-Australia.html    Originally my stay in Byron bay was going to be 4 nights and all on my own staying at the Lord Byron Hotel. A late add of Western plains Zoofari meant stealing a night from here and also 2 from Hobart.    IBB was included in my trip as I wanted to include a few new places and Maggie Groff made the town and hotel sound charming in her books.    I arrived with Bokhara mid to late afternoon on Wednesday 1st November after stopping for a few hours at The farm for a wander about and a really good lunch. Well worth visiting but do book if wanting to dine.    Plenty of parking at the hotel and we wandered in to check in. Both our rooms were on the second floor and it had no lift. Although I can manage stairs fine the stairs from the first floor did not continue straight up to the next floor but you had to walk around a corner and then somewhere else before going up again. The member of staff could see I was finding it a bit tricky to remember the way (sight impairment) so said I know lets move you to the first floor and tool me to a room right wa way that was easier for me to find. She also moved Bokhara down to the first floor too and they insisted they would bring our luggage up. Whilst the lady was younger than me (considerably so) I was a heck of a lot more strapping than her and reckoned I was more able to lug my 22kg case up the stairs than she was but she would not hear of me doing myself.    Room was a decent size with a nuc balcony tea and coffee making facilities and a small fridge.Found out later that the bed was very comfortable and the room temperature neither too hot nor too cold for me.    Having familiarised myself with my abode I left Bokhara with her book in her room and i headed out to explore. The hotel is situated on Johnson Street which is a main and at time busy thoroughfare with shops restaurants and cafes o both sides of the street as well as where the Greyhound Bus stops and Visitor information centre is located.    About a 10 minute walk and i was at the beachfront. The wind that had followed us all the way from Rocky continued to hear. Great for Surfers not so great for my plans for some relaxing on the beach on the following days. Had a stroll past the surf club and found a free bench to sit and watch the beach scene and read a chapter of my book.    I then headed back to the hotel to get showered and changed as we had a dinner reservation for 7pm at Bonito‚Äôs nearby. Our friend met us at our hotel 9since neither of us knew where we were going) and we strolled the 5 minutes around the corner to the hotel where the restaurant is. We headed up to a lovely roof top terrace for cocktails (reall good cocktails) and to watch the sun setting whilst we waited for our table in the restaurant below. it was an eclectic set menu (https://cdn-hotelmarvell.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bonito-All-menus-Website-and-Customers-Nov23.pdf) and we had a great time catching up.    Next morning we had a goodbye/part company breakfast at Sunday Sustainable Bakery. Bokhara went to pack and check out and I headed to my room for a while to sort how what I would need for the day. At this point I noted that the charging cable for my Iphone was damaged with the coating missing from a spot and the wires exposed.    First order then was find a shop for a new cable. I vaguely recalled seeing a phone repair shop next to the Visitor centre and right beside the Greyhound Bus stop so that was my first port of call. Unfortunately they had sold their last lightening cable less than an hour ago. She cautioned me not to use the damaged one and said to try one of the other phone shops in town (didn‚Äôt suggest where they might be though).    Since i was right at the Visitor centre i decided to head in for a tourist map and some suggestions on what I could do over the next 2 full days. I already knew I wanted to go to the Lighthouse and mentioned that. can‚Äôt say this was my best experience in a Visitors centre. She didn‚Äôt seem to be able to adapt to me not having a car. I thought they would be used to that with tourists spilling off the greyhound bus outside their door.    She did give me a map and show me the route to walk up to the Lighthouse following the road and the route back down through the national park. Then it went downhill from there. She started pointing out places and then say oh no you won‚Äôt be able to get there and so it went on. I then said I liked art so were there any good galleries in town. She then got a photocopied sheet of over a dozen places and then proceeded t cross them all of bar one. I gave up at that point and decided I‚Äôd work things out for myself with the map provided.    Back outside I was determined to get a replacement charging cable since i depended on my phone being charged to navigate myself around following my blue dot. Googling phone shops I found one right next door to my hotel. In my defence i didn‚Äôt pass it as it was the opposite direction from the beach. Fortunately not being so obvious nor right beside the greyhound bus stop probably less obvious to careless travellers (like me) and I got my new cable.    I had booked Beach Byron Bay for lunch and decided to set off for there as google was telling me it was a 25 minute walk and I was due to be there in 45 minutes. I was slower than Google reckoned and it took me 35 minutes to walk there but no doubt because i stopped a few times to look at shops the view and take photos. It is an idyllic setting right on the beach itself. Impeccable service great food and drink. Really enjoyed every minute i was almost last out but not quite! Really recommend this place. it‚Äôs not cheap but I didn‚Äôt grudge a cent. https://beachbyronbay.com.au/    I had walked there partially through cutting through time and only along the waterfront for the final 1 minutes so decided to walk back along the beachfront sopping at a few point to just sit and admire the views. Still too windy for me making it too cool for swimming or sun bathing.    Eventually i came to a flight of stairs that seems to be close to the bottom of Johnson Street so it seemed a good short cut. Other folk were going that way so I just followed them. the people in front held the gate open for me and it was only after it shut at my rear end that I realised i was in the Reflections Holiday park and didn‚Äôt have a key fob to go back out. A member of staff came over and asked me if i needed help and i explained that i had come in without realising where I was and shouldn‚Äôt be there as a non guest. he was fine about it and asked where i was heading and waved over towards the road entrance as the best way to go. off i went only to be confronted with another member of staff who was not nearly as nice. he barked at me was I a guest and as soon as I said no he started yelling at me that I should not be there. I explained that i knew that and had not intentionally come in and was on my way out. he thawed a bit at that although I‚Äôm fairly sure he watched me to make sure i did leave.    That holiday park is a a fantastic spot and the cabins are all well maintained judging from the exteriors anyway and security is clearly very good!    I eventually made it back to my hotel to relax on my balcony with my book before cleaning up and heading out again. (There is no restaurant in the hotel and room service is only a bar service). As it gets dark fairly early there (well not quite as early as Queensland) i did not want to be going too far nor having a fancy meal after my spectacular lunch so i just headed 4 minute down the street to Tokyo Doll for a quick and casual meal. they have some outside seating on high stools but that wind was still a blowing so I headed indoors. Food was fine nothing special but not bad either and casual and cheap like i wanted.    That ended my first full day in Byron Bay up next Cape Byron lighthouse walk ,AmoMondo,Byron Bay,"Edinburgh, United..."
After a three week stay in the Solomon Islands on business I will be heading home to Canada with a stop off in Brisbane. I thought that I would use the occasion to visit the area and am leaning towards a six night stay on the Gold Coast - Surfer's Paradise specifically. Dates have not yet been firmed up but it will likely be from April 8 to April 14.    I would like to be close to the beach (preferably on the beach) and a short walking distance to nearby restaurants shopping etc.. Also given the length of my stay accommodations with a kitchen/suite would be my first choice.    Would anyone be able to please recommend any 4 to 5 star hotel/resort suggestions that would suitable for a solo female traveler. I understand that this might be a busy time with autumn school holidays kicking off. If possible I am looking for something more adult-oriented.    Any and all advice and suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance. ,Reau,Gold Coast,"Ottawa, Canada"

Hi  Next October my husband and I are coming to Brisbane for a friend‚Äôs wedding which is over a weekend.we plan to spend 3 weeks in allwe have never been to Australia before.we love to be by the coastto chill eat drink and love to walk.So my dilemma starts here!  We are flying into Brisbanepossibly 2/3 nights therethinking a hotel then onto the wedding for 3 nights in Byron baythen possibly pick up a Motorhome on the Monday for maybe 9/10 nights?we would love to end our holiday at the whitsundays but most Motorhome companies state you need to drop off at cairns or Brisbane and we would rather drop off at airline beachneed to then get to.cairns then maybe fly home from cairns??as we don‚Äôt really want to do the drive on from airline beach to cairns as we have heard it‚Äôs not that great and want to finish the holiday on a high with not much driving if we can help it as we can‚Äôt book our flights until we have decided where to fly home from.If this isn‚Äôt feasible are there any other lovely parts we could finish our holiday at that‚Äôs like the whitsundays if we end up heading back to Brisbane and fly home from there.we appreciate Aus is huge but don‚Äôt want to feel like we are going back on ourselves on the way home.  Any recommendations of places to visit {we have a few on our list already!]would be greatly appreciated    Sorry that was longI hope it made sense!  Thank you  Colette .; ,Colette,Brisbane,
Are there any spots along the GOR that are known for spotting koala bears and kangaroos this time of the year?    I read the golf course will definitely try to hit the restaurant there to try our luck. Are there other spots where they are easy to spot?    I also wanted to check how common are car break-ins along the GOR? Do you recommend folks leave their bags at the luggage storage at the airport rather than in the truck esp SUV where the truck is visible?    Lastly - do you have any recommendations for good places to hit on this drive? Open to meal coffee bakeries brekkie spots!    Thank you!! ,RiaMia,,"Seattle, Washington"

So we‚Äôve been at Noosaville for almost two weeks having a lovely time. Kiddos stayed home so it‚Äôs just hubs and me and I‚Äôve planned our dining well.  Not going to the super fancy places because saving those for when Ellen comes over in March.  Anyhooo it‚Äôs the first two weeks of QLD school hols but still not super busy as that doesn‚Äôt kick off until next weekend.  We‚Äôve eaten at Zachary‚Äôs on Hastings St The Surf Club the Yacht Club Embassy XO Yo-yo and Frenchie‚Äôs (all very enjoyable) and Rasa (average). Some lunch some dinner some mid afternoon.  I haven‚Äôt bothered with reservations anywhere except Frenchie‚Äôs Sunday set menu lunch - and we didn‚Äôt need to book but I wanted to be sure of that one. I can highly recommend the special for good value as well as the excellent service received.  Today I called 250 Grammi (according to Rupert‚Äôs esteemed newspaper one of the best pizza joints in Queensland) to make a reservation for tomorrow lunch as my 80+ year old folks are coming up to see us and I want to show them that pizza can be more than Dominoes.  So booked for four pax inside 12pm. Was asked for my CC details which I provided as I get the no show thing. He then said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt show OR CANCEL You will be charged $60.00 per person.‚Äù  I said ‚Äúlook I phoned to book to do the right thing by you but I‚Äôm coming with my 80yo folks and they could have a health issue. I would always call to cancel but I don‚Äôt want to be penalised if I have to cancel because they have a problem ‚Äú. He said well you will be charged.  I said ‚Äúok then I‚Äôm backing out of booking now and will take my chances of a place tomorrow as a walk in.‚Äù  He agreed but still has my card details.  We will presumably turn up and be fine as he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs Thursday lunch it won‚Äôt be too busy‚Äù but seriously why ask for the card details and put a bad taste in my mouth?  I get it post Christmas when it will be heaving and a no show means a loss of custom but I‚Äôm at a loss as to the logic of not accepting a genuine cancellation phone call without charge if the above unlikely circumstances arise when they are not sort of tables anyway.  It better be awesome food and service tomorrow! And if we don‚Äôt show and there is a charge on y card my bank will be getting a phone call and the restaurant will be getting some very specific feedback.  Cheers. ,sweetbiscuit21üèñüèï,Sunshine Coast,"Brisbane, Australia"
Hi all    We're looking to spend a week or so in the Snowys after Christmas. We would like to climb Mt Kosciusko so I was planning on booking camping at Tom Groggin campground soon so we can be close-ish to Thredbo. I also have a couple wineries near Tumbarumba and the Yarrangobilly Caves on my list but I wouldn't mind doing some touring around. Either as a day trip or take the camper and move around a bit even south into Victoria perhaps? We can be fully self-sufficient if needed.    We've been to the region before but that was during winter so a slightly different experience!    Any ideas on routes or special stops gratefully received! ,daffstarring,New South Wales,Queensland...

Due to the recent weather damages in Cairns we need guidance.  We are Arriving in Sydney on the 26 and were planning to depart to Cairns on the 29. Flying out to Auckland on January 4. We realize we need to stay out of that area.  Between Brisbane and Melbourne which will have better weather nature exposure?  We will have 5 days to explore another area besides Sydney  Please advise.  THANK YOU! ,Liliana L,Cairns,
Hi all    First I hope everyone in the Cairns area is ok. I am just now catching up on the news of the cyclone impacts and it doesn‚Äôt sound good!    My dilemma is we leave for Cairnes in 5 days arriving in 6. We have 4 nights in an airbnb in Palm Cove before heading out for other parts of Australia - not right on the beach but within walking distance of one. I have sent a note to our airbnb host to get an idea of the impacts to the house and area but also wanted to expand my inquiry to others. The house is now past time of being refundable‚Ä¶.    Our plans include flying into Cairns and renting a car to drive to Palm Cove. Doing the skyrail to Karunda one day. Doing a day up at Daintree another day.    Any insight anyone can provide about what things are like on the ground and what their thoughts are for what things will be like next week would be greatly appreciated‚Ä¶particularly for Palm Cove.    Thank you for any insight and those of you in the area are well! ,Becky 25,Cairns,"Centennial, Colorado"

Hi we plan to bring our kids (age 14 11 & 8yo) to Luna Park Melbourne sometime this week.    We will either bring them on Thursday 21st Dec (which is the start of the Australia school holiday) or on Sunday 24th Dec (which is Christmas eve)    My question is whether will there be less crowd on a 21st dec school holiday but is on a weekday? Or will it less crowded on 24 Dec on Christmas Eve where everybody should be home with family I assume? üòÖ    And do I need to prebook the tickets? Is it more safe to pre-book or to see the weather and just buy on the spot?    I would appreciate if someone who is more familiar with the theme park can advise me please?  Appreciate all your feedback!  Thanks so much!!!! ,tanshuyin,Melbourne,Penang Island...
Hi.  Does the myki Weekend Cap and Daily Fare means the total charged to my myki card is $7.20 and $10 respectively for a day although I travel many times using the train bus and tram in a day?    For example if I travel from Southern Cross Railway Station to Ballarat Railway Station then ride a bus to Sovereign Hill (return) the fare shown is $10 for the train and $2.60 for the bus (one way). Hence the total should be $25.20. Or will it be $7.20 in total for the whole day on Saturday?    Also should I touch my myki in and out of the train and bus to get the weekend cap or daily fare?    Thank you. ,Haziyah M,Victoria,

Hi -    My wife and I are visting Melbourne for the first time and we are starying for 3 days. We have already 2 days planned and the third one is taking shape. We would like to get some inputs about it specially because it seems that between December 25th and 27th there are a lot things closed.    The third day is about the following:    Breakfast - Project 281 Coffee Roasters or Bellboy Caf√© or THE NICHOLSON COFFEE & EATERY or Kines or A1 Bakery    Morning  Exploring Brunswick walking Sydney Rd then we head to East Brunswick visiting CERES (probably by bike or taking an Uber) finally we visit the Edinburgh Gardens (probably by bike or taking an Uber).    Lunch - Naked For Satan or Neighbourhood Wine or Easey's or 102 Uniq or TONKIN or Shop Ramen    Afternoon  Exploring Fitzroy walking the Brunswick St then we go to Carlton Gardens and the question mark about visiting The University of Melbourne or Abbotsford Convent.    The questions:  Is this a good intinerary? Are we missing something worth the visit in the surrounds? Is there something closed in December 27th that we should be aware?

Hi üôÇ  I'm landing in Sydney on the 14th of January.  To be honest I'm not used to traveling so this one is kind of huge for me.    Ideally I want to stay in Sydney maybe 3 days before I find a smaller and cheaper place where I can stay near the ocean. I am pretty active and love to do a lot of waking/hiking and never go out to party.    I have no idea where to go after Sydney so I'd love to get some advice on where I should look for accommodation. Small and quiet üôÇ    Appreciate all replies üôÇ ,torbjornhb,,"Elnesvagen, Norway"
We will be traveling to the area January 25th. I have seen news reports that the Captain Cook highway will be closed for several days and other reports saying until the end of January.

We have 10 days coming up in Melbourne in late December/early January. We'd love to spend a day around the Yarra Valley checking out the wineries chocolate gin etc. We have two teenagers (17 and 14) who obviously won't have a tipple but will enjoy the other options.    I realise that one option is renting a car/car-share but it would be nice not to have to drive. But I haven't been able to find a public small group tour operator that takes anyone under 18 - and we can't really afford a private tour for the four of us.

If leaving Australia to apply for a working visa and only leaving for a week as have to leave the country at the 3 month mark. Want to apply for a working visa but if that doesn‚Äôt come through in the 7 days we are out of the country can I then apply for visitor visa or indeed do I have to apply as have done the 3 months on visitor visa but want to come back in on the visitor visa if the working visa does not come through.

I just returned from 2 weeks in Australia split between Melbourne and Sydney. Prior to my trip I asked this forum about using cards vs cash because for most of my non-US travels (over 30 years) I have obtained cash from an ATM at the airport upon arrival. Based on helpful advice on this forum I decided to skip collecting cash.    I am thrilled to report back that I NEVER needed any cash during my time in Australia. For 100% of my transactions I was able (and often required) to make my payment with a credit card or in my case my electronic wallet on my phone. I used Apple pay for every single purchase no matter how small or who the vendor was. Also I was never required to enter a PIN.    However as yvwords pointed out you need to be aware of that your card issuer may charge foreign transaction fees. My card (Chase Sapphire) does not have any foreign transaction fees so there were no additional fees for the hundreds of transactions I made.    Side note: using the tram/bus systems were incredibly easy affordable and efficient.    To everyone who provided advice on this forum thank you. ,ReddPupp,Melbourne,Palm Springs...

Hi we are travelling to New Zealand and Australia at the end of January and I have 2 questions. I know we need an ETA ( subclass 601) but I was wondering what dates to put on it. We are flying Vancouver to Sydney then connecting to Wellington we will not leave the airport. We then fly back to Brisbane a month later for a 2 week stay in the Brisbane area. Should I have the date as the end of January or March 1st. Second question is which cell company is the easiest to get an Australian SIM card in the Airport. ,l6419,Sydney,"Calgary, Canada"

Hi all  What days trips would you recommend from Sydney by either coach or train between 1-2 hours away?  I am travelling on my own (30+ yr old female) and am currently in Sydney. I'm not driving out here so need somewhere easily accessible. I want to see beautiful scenery and have the option of cafes/restaurants.  I'm not looking to do a hike or anything too strenuous but a gentle climb up to see some scenery is ok.  So far I've seen Blue Mountains National Park mentioned and Kiama.    Most important has to be the accessibility via public transport.    TIA ,SJS,Sydney,"London, United..."

Looking at going to Aus Open in January next year and a little confused - I know tickets haven't gone on sale yet but we were looking at going during the second week just to see some matches - with potentially booking specific games like the semis and finals.    On the days it is just regular games you can only buy a ground pass? Do we buy one of them and then just wander into a game we want to see?    Or will specific games become available (even the early pool stages) at some point?    Want to catch some games and it seems buying a ground pass doesn't guarantee your chances of being able to head into an arena and see an actual game? ,Trevor G,Melbourne,"Brisbane, Australia"
Hi there we are planning to spend a few days driving between Adelaide and Melbourne on the Great Ocean road in May.  We will hire a car from Adelaide and return it in Melbourne .

Got all the necessary logistics for 10 days in Sydney and now just focusing on a list of things to do. This trip will be a more relaxed one and one I expect we‚Äôll take one day at a time. Thanks to everyone on the forum who‚Äôs given ideas. For me this is a repeat visit and my friend it‚Äôs the first. We are staying in the CBD in between the Town Hall Station and Darling Harbour. We‚Äôll be there for NYE and have plans arranged for that night already. Everything else we‚Äôll do is gravy and I tried to plan this so we have some flexibility and able to take advantage of the weather day by day.    Assuming weather is good I have a list of beaches including Manly Shelly and Balmoral. Walks include Cogee to Bondi and Manly to Spit Bridge.    I also have a few day trip options to see stuff out of the city. My #1 option is the first. We won‚Äôt do all four but probably at least two separate day trips maybe 3. And we‚Äôd hire a car for the day. Which are your faves?  - Royal National Park/Wollongong/Bridge including Minnamura Rainforest and Balds Hill Lookout and Nan Tien Temple. Maybe head down to Kiami if time allows.  - Kangaroo Valley  - Ku-Ring  - Blue Mountains    Back in Sydney I noted things like the Red Fern neighborhood The Rocks Circular Quay Bondi as neighborhoods we‚Äôll explore.    Any good eats or bars? We‚Äôll have access to a kitchen in our rental but hopefully we find some cool places to eat with good food. We love all types from good food to casual good takeaway to take to the beach with us or just a hole in the wall.    Anything you love that maybe most people miss? Having been to Sydney many of times I‚Äôm looking for a few suggestions outside of the typical tourist ones.    I also noted some Christmas things like the markets at The Rocks Martin Place and Darking Harbour. Are there any other things to do?    I heard that there will be places to grab food on Christmas Day but was wondering if that‚Äôs a day we should earmark for a day trip. Although I wonder if there will be less places open outside of the city. ,CSquaredC2,Sydney,San Francisco...

Over the years there's been many questions / discussions about Australia ceasing passport stamping going digital etc. with SmartGates and everything. Yes legislation has been changed so that passports no longer 'need' to be stamped on arrival / departure. However these are still available on request at secondary counters (and some manned primary counters) even if you use a SmartGate. The trick is that you have to ask/request it.

Hi all - know it isn't the best time of year for this trip but would like to hear from the experts what they think of our itinerary. We are arriving mid-March for 11 nights. Thinking we would fly right to Uluru for 2 nights (Kata Tjuta Cultural Centre Ayers Rock) rent car and drive to Alice Springs for 2 nights(Desert Park) Fly to Sydney for 3 nights(Harbor Bridge Opera House Blue Mountains Bondi Beach) fly to Cairns for 3 nights (Reef Tjapukai and perhaps Kuranda) and fly back to Sydney for the final night before our international trip home. Do to timing and cost do not want to fly from Alice Springs to Cairns round trip from Sydney is cheaper and less stops. Is this doable? Other suggestions for that time of year?

Due to time constraint a group of 6 elderly ladies (mid 70s) plan to visit Tasmania in April 2023.  The trip starts from Launceston on April 13 as we will fly from Melbourne and ends in Hobart where we will fly back to Sydney on April 21 We are interested in sightseeing - small towns countryside coastal views. It is a self-drive trip when we take turn behind the wheels and would not dare going up the rural steep roads if possible.  Looking at the map of Tasmania and the points of in and out we just wonder if the following itinerary is practical for April travel.

One for the Road    Most of us would know the origin & meaning of ‚ÄúOne for the Road‚Äù but it‚Äôs gone with the days of mandatory drink driving. Those Australians who earned their Drivers Licences after 1979 will be picking their jaws up off the ground; what do you mean ‚Äúmandatory drinking?‚Äù. The adults amongst us will be recalling the ‚ÄúBona Fide Traveller‚Äù proof required to have a drink on Sundays. From the SMH    ‚Äú Serve only Bona Fide Travellers. Here‚Äôs a brilliant notion: Instead of banning drink-driving why not make it mandatory? In most Australian States for much of our European history you could order a drink on a Sunday only if you were a ‚Äúbona fide traveller‚Äù. The distance travelled varied: in South Australia in the 1880‚Äôs it was five miles in Victoria it was 10 miles in a direct line but it had to be travelled on the day in which the alohol was consumed. In NSW right up until 1979 (Yes gentle reader ‚Äì 1979!) it was 30 miles with the publican required to take a note of your ‚Äúreasons for travel‚Äù. As Pete Brown notes in his history of beer the result was squadrons of drunks navigating their way from one town to another just in order to qualify for a drink.‚Äù  This isn‚Äôt that ‚ÄúOne for the Road‚Äù but ‚Ä¶ ,Bokhara,,Gold Coast...

Hi! I am planning a trip for my family of 4 next December to Australia and New Zealand. We would likely visit 2 weeks maybe a little more or less. I really want to spend a lot of time in NZ as I've never been but we want to bring the kids to Sydney (will be 11 and 13) to meet my BIL's family. My husband has also never been there. We are more nature-oriented than city and museums but I feel a bit overwhelmed how to split the time between the two countries and what to realistically plan around Sydney. We want to see family and visit the coast and opera house. Should we make time to visit a national park too? If so which one? There are so many! We love hiking and do tons in the US but seeing kangaroos or koalas or learning about aboriginal cultures would be enriching. Can anyone give me tips to get started on what's realistic and which direction to look? (We are also about nervous about driving there but assume we'll get used it it - hopefully!) ,Erika Z,New South Wales,

Hey everyone  we're planning to week long trip in March. 2 adults and a 16 yr old. Landing in Sydney and flying out of Brisbane. Looking for suggestions on areas to stay in (preferably hotels and not airbnbs). Here's a rough itinerary  Day 1 - Sunday - arrive early am. Check in rest Walk to Opera house explore Circular Quay get acclimatized etc.  Day 2 - Monday - Day trip to blue mountains scenic world (can move this to day 3 as well). Can't find tix for dinosaur valley. Will it be closed? Also - should we hire a rental and drive or just take public transport?  Day 3 - Tuesday - Bondi beach and markets  Day 4 - Wednesday - What can we do here? Thinking of taking a flight to Brisbane. Would a drive (stopping in Canberra) be a better option?  Day 5 - Thursday - Koala sanctuary?  Day 6 - Friday - beach  Day 7 - Saturday - what do we do here?  Day 8 - Sunday - flight out of Brisbane early am.    This is a very rough itinerary as you can see. We aren't much for nightlife / clubbing / drinking / bars. But we love to sightsee visit museums and just absorb the general atmosphere. We will be fasting for Ramadan so only need to break for an evening meal.  1) What activities would you suggest?  2) We plan to use public transport as much as we can. What areas should we stay in (easy access to public transport near all attractions) in both cities? ,myfavoritething,Sydney,"Herndon, Virginia"

Hi all    I know a similar question was asked recently but I was hoping you could help me out.    I'm in my mid 20s and will be fortunate enough to have two weeks to spend in Australia in March. I'm most interested in the country's nature wildlife landscapes and aboriginal history but would like to explore the cities if there's time too.  I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to begin planning this adventure. Just off the bat I'm thinking of traversing the east coast flying into Melbourne and out of Brisbane getting from one to the other in the 14 days. To save spending all the days travelling I'll book the greyhound night buses (I think they're a thing) for the long journeys. Also in the fanciful initial plan I'd spend a day or two in the cities and travel to more rural areas to hike and experience the aforementioned interests as well as a bit of coast spending the nights in hostels if not travelling between places.  Can you help me out as to suggest things to do useful ways to plan this sort of thing itineraries etc and let me know if this plan is too ludicrous.  I'm a social lad who enjoys meeting new people and going on adventures with them but I'm equally as content in my own company.  A lot to unpack here but I'll appreciate all your useful wisdom that you care to impart.  Cheers!  -A brit ,A_Brit,,
Hi Folks    Just received a NAB Debit card to replace the Citybank debit card after the NAB takeover of City Bank. I'm not a NAB customer and don't particularly want to be. My assumptions are that the benefits enjoyed under the Citybank card such as excellent forex rates and ATM fee free transactions will be no more. I don't intend activating my new NAB card.

And can we take the coastal highway all the way to 12 Apostles? Stay somewhere there and take the fastest route back?  Is there a different route/place you all recommend? We would want to enjoy the scenic views and experience Australia outside of the cities ,RiaMia,,"Seattle, Washington"
We'll be visiting Melbourne in December I fancied a tour combining a ride on Puffing Billy with a tour of a couple of wineries. I get several web hits for this combo for various tour companies but every one shows as currently unavailable. There are plenty offering the train with a nature park of some kind but the winery combo seems to be withdrawn. Anyone know if there is a reason for that? ,Gardening D,Melbourne,
We are visiting Norfolk Island from 25th November 2023 to 2nd December 2023 and would like to experience a Thanksgiving meal on Wednesday the 29th November which is a public holiday. Does anyone know if the restaurants put on this special meal? Is there a Food Festival on that week providing food stalls open to the public? I can only find one tour for $168 pp for the church service and a meal which I think is too expensive. Any info would be much appreciated. ,Cheryl H,Norfolk Island,Australia
Hi fellow travelers    Just spent an amazing week in Brisbane Australia and wanted to share some key insights to make your visit as enjoyable as mine!    Immigration    ‚Ä¢ Pretty smooth process. Tip: Keep a note on your phone about items to declare. It‚Äôs really appreciated by the staff.    Food Recommendations    ‚Ä¢ Felon‚Äôs The Hotel Transatlantic: Great dining experiences.  ‚Ä¢ Indian restaurants in West End: Absolutely a must-try.  ‚Ä¢ Harris Farm: Fresh and delicious choices.    Accommodation    ‚Ä¢ Stayed at Selina in CBD. Fantastic location with free drinks every evening and a fabulous attached restaurant.    What To Do    ‚Ä¢ West End: A treasure trove of spots to explore.  ‚Ä¢ Farmers market in CBD on Wednesday afternoons.  ‚Ä¢ Australia Zoo: Witness Steve Irwin‚Äôs son feed crocs! Pro tip: Catch a train and shuttle from central station for an easy trip. Best to arrive by 11 am for the 1:15 pm croc show.  ‚Ä¢ Pine Koala Sanctuary: A highlight. To hold a koala arrive at 9 am to book in person.    Food Hacks    ‚Ä¢ Delicious mangoes especially the Kensington variety.  ‚Ä¢ Subway offers a filling and budget-friendly breakfast.    Transport Tips    ‚Ä¢ Go cards for public transport are not available online for foreigners. You can buy them at certain locations. The drivers are understanding if you‚Äôre without one occasionally.    Missed Out    ‚Ä¢ Unfortunately didn‚Äôt visit the free botanical gardens or experience the free city tour bus. Next time!    Hope these tips help. Brisbane is a friendly and vibrant city with so much to offer! ,minkathebest,,San Francisco...
Hi there looking for some advice on driving v. flying and if driving what routes:  1.Staying in Melbourne from Jan 20-24 (Australian open! Tickets already purchased but any other advice is welcome!)  2. Only set next date is Jan 30 (Opera House Tickets) and Flight out on Jan 31.    Current plan was to leave Melbourne Jan 24 and spend two days driving to Sydney going either a more mountainous route or coastal (Looking for all advice for routes!) Am I better off saving those two days flying directly into Sydney and taking day trips from there?    I'm a florist so bonus points if anyone has any recommendations for flower farms along the journey that are worth stopping at and have any sort of open to the public space. Thank you!! ,Carrie H,Melbourne,

Dear Australia Experts  Would greatly appreciate feedback on proposed itinerary below. We are a couple in our late 50s from Los Angeles in good health and like an active and dynamic sightseeing trip. Planned for 3 weeks (usually our maximum travel time before we get burned out!) but can do a few days longer if suggested. We are targeting March 2023 unless an expert says this is not a good idea. We visited New Zealand in March 2020 and had generally good weather. We like being in nature (short walks/easy hikes cycling kayaking swimming snorkeling) as well as city sightseeing/touring (museums shopping restaurants wineries).    I'm struggling a little bit with the Northern Territory days. Seems there are no accommodations in/near Helen Gorge unless someone can offer some lodging ideas. But we can drive down to Kings Canyon and stay a night if that makes sense. Or we can skip Kings Canyon and just drive directly from Alice Springs to Uluru on Day 12.    I also really wanted to see the Whitsundays...if anyone has a suggestion on how to include this area that would be great!    Looking forward to any and all suggestions!  Many Thanks Lisa    Day 1: Fly LAX to Sydney  Day 2: Arrive Sydney  Day 3: Sydney Harbour Circular Quay Sydney Opera House Pylon Lookout The Rocks Distric  Day 4: Coastal Walk (Recommended Coogee to Bondi Swim Bronte Baths ferry to Manly Beach in afternoon)  Day 5: Blue Mountains (go with organized tour)  Day 6: Fly to Cairns (3 hrs) Explore Cairns and Cycle Cairns Esplande in afternoon  Day 7: Day Trip to Green Island and Great Barrier Reef  Day 8: Skyrail & Kuranda Scenic Railway  Day 9: Take guided tour to Daintree (Active Tropics Explorer): Mossman Gorge Daintree River Cruise Cape Tribulation Marrdja Botanical Walk Mount Alexandria Lookout (10 hrs)  Day 10: Fly Cairns to Alice Springs (6 hrs); pick up 4-wheel drive vehicle  Day 11: Drive West Mac Donnell Ranges to Standley Chasm Ellery Creek Big Hole Ochre Pits Ormiston Gorge (Ghost Gum Lookout Trail) Glen Helen Gorge (back to Alice Springs late afternoon‚Ä¶or drive Red Centre Way to Kings Canyon?)

Hi we are on our way to 1770 for a few days from today. I think we will miss the cyclone but aware it will have made the sea rough. We were wondering about a day trip to lady musgrave island?  We are headed to great Keppel island after 1770 and Agnes Water so just wondering how similar and experience they are? As a family of 4 trips add up. Will the cyclone hsve made the waters very choppy therefore less to see? Interested in the opinions of you guys who know the areas well.  Thanks so much. ,Megan W,Gold Coast,"Northwich, United..."
Can I apply for Medicare before arriving in Australia? I have an address out there already and would ideally like to go to a GP the moment I land in the Gold Coast (I have MS and can only bring 3 months worth of medication so I need more as I plan to be out for a year).

We have 7 days in mid-February between our stay in Sydney and our stay in Melbourne. How should we spend it?    We thought of just driving down the coast to Melbourne but we're tempted by Great Ocean Road and Kangaroo island.

I booked myself on one of the snorkeling trips that the resort I was staying at recommended.    First of all it was a lot of money and especially converting from the currency that I have. I thought it would be a nice boat trip from the description.    Reality was different. I was alone which made it worse. Got on the boat which was jammed packed with people. I could barely find a seat. Food was really not good for what you are paying. A lot of people around when snorkeling.    The good side was the snorkeling its self. I haven't seen corals like that before. The dive instructors and snorkeling instructors were good.    It's a pity though you have to go through one of these companies to see the reefs. ,Penny B,Great Barrier Reef,"Johannesburg, South..."

My wife and I (visitors from the US) will be visiting Melbourne for the Australian Open in January and are planning on driving the GOR leaving Melbourne on Saturday January 20th and will be spending the night in Apollo Bay. We plan on leaving Melbourne around 8am (cannot do much earlier as the auto rental will not yet be open). We can only spend one night and cannot do two (we also cannot change the date). We want to see as much as possible without being overwhelmed. Of course we want to see the 12 Apostles and I have also heard The Grotto Gibson‚Äôs steps and Loch Ard Gorge. Also open to other suggestions. What is the best plan of attack? We will have two full days and we just need to be back to the Melbourne airport by 9pm Sunday to return our rental car. I know the 12 Apostles are beyond Apollo Bay but not sure of the locations of the other landmarks. Should we drive out to the 12 Apostles on our first day then drive back to AB or should we drive to AB spend the night and drive to the 12 Apostles the next day. Looking for suggestions for the best itinerary to make the most of our 2 days. Thanks. ,TMFConcord,Melbourne,Concord...
Hey all!    Have just been chatting to the husband and floated an idea with him I was a little bit reluctant to put forward. But he has supported the idea.    I‚Äôd like to take my eldest E on a bit of a mother-son road trip. Thing is he starts ‚Äòbig school‚Äô next year and I‚Äôd love to do something special with him. I‚Äôd love a family holiday but it‚Äôs just not going to work out with leave etc and while I don‚Äôt want everyone else to miss out (which is why I was reluctant to float the idea) I also would love to have one last hurrah with my ‚Äòbaby‚Äô.    Because everyone else will miss out I‚Äôd like to keep it pretty budget (at least accom wise). We will mostly want to get out and have some quality time together and it will be more about him then me. I want it to be special because I know our time together is going to be a lot more limited now he‚Äôs at school five days a week and the other two will still get some of the weekdays at home with me.    Probably aim for the start of our ‚ÄòHeat Week‚Äô and go from the Friday to Wednesday (so five nights) to coincide with the other two‚Äôs day care as hubby will still be working (poor thing).    I was thinking starting or ending in Newcastle to spend some time with my sister and maybe some time in Port Stephens because he‚Äôd love some of the activities (camel rides dolphin watching etc) but open to suggestions. We could also potentially move around a bit/go anywhere else. Honestly open!    He likes swimming (quieter ‚Äòbay‚Äô type beaches would be better for him at this stage or great pools!) adventures exploring babycinos slides‚Ä¶ ,Shansicles,,"Narrabri, Australia"
Hi - my family of 4 (with two kids 4.5Y and 2Y) will be visiting Blue mountains in April 2024. We're looking to take it slow and spend at least two nights in the Wentworth falls <> Katoomba area doing hikes and just soaking it in.    Which town would you recommend we stay in (Katoomba? Leura?

I'll be in Australia between mid-February and mid-March. I'm going with my wife and a 4 and a half month old baby.    We've already been to Australia and we've been to Fraser Island the Whitsundays and Great Barrier Reef. I think that with the baby these will perhaps be places to exclude.    Our idea will be to arrive in Sydney and do a 2 week road trip to the Sunshine Coast and then fly to Tasmania and visit before going to Adelaide Kangaroo Island and a road trip from Adelaide to Melbourne. Is it possible to do it this way? Do you suggest doing something different?  How many days do you recommend for Tasmania? And for the Adelaide-Melbourne roadtrip?

Hello all    I am seeking recommendations for an 8-year-old kid to go in Tasmania. We will go to Cradle Mountain (Dove lake area) Hobart and Launceston (e.g. Hollybank Treetops Adventure Park Penn royal adventures Cataract Gorge Reserve).  For other parts of TAS it depends on whether there are sights worth visiting. We have only few days and yet TAS is so big so there must be some trade-offs. Here is what I thought and would like your suggestions.    1. Maria Island (one day tour) (to feel surrounded by wombats)  2. Seahorse museum and platypus house in Beauty Point (unique to see in Tas?)  3. Don river railway near Davonport (Is this worth going if we had already visited Puffin Billy steam train and the Workshop railways museum near Brisbane?)  4. Tasmazia & The Village Of Lower Crackpot (not sure if this one if worth going though...Is it small and man-made? We are not fans of photo takings...  5. Bay of Fires? (better for adults to appreciate view?)  6. Winglass BAy (better for adults to appreciate view?)    Appreciate your sharing of MUST GOs for kids of similar ages. ,Chloe W,Tasmania,
Hi there    I previously entered Australia in 2013 on a Working Holiday Visa and completed my 3 months farm work to obtain the second WHV.    I completed my second year WHV in 2015 and loved every second of it!    After many years I'm 33 and have a change in circumstances. I've looked into the third year visa changes upcoming in July 2024 and was hopeful of some clarification as things currently look positive!    From my understanding on July 1st I will be able to apply for a third year WHV regardless of when my first two were and if farm work was completed in either year one or two. I read it as I'm under 35 have the correct passport etc - my third year extension will be granted?    I only slightly skeptical as my first two visas were such a long time ago and I can't find any information if this will impact.    Can anyone please advise if my logic/thinking is correct?!    Thanks in advance  Sam ,Sam P,,"Bristol, United..."

Hey all!    Was hoping for recommendations on the best place to go to see snow (bucket list item for my Mum) from Melbourne in August without a car. I've done some research here and on Google and most people recommend Lake Mountain or Mt Donna Buang but they don't really seem accessible without a car. The coach service from Melb to LM looks like it's ceasing in December 2023 and there aren't any to MDB.    So that leaves Mt Baw Baw and Mt Buller - I read that Mt Baw Baw can be a little more unpredictable with snow and I can only seem to find a day trip bus service there? We're looking at staying for two nights and really just want to enjoy the snow maybe got on a snow walk build a snowman tobaggon etc.    I've been to Mt Buller before 15 odd years ago and really enjoyed the vibe of the village so I'm leaning towards that just because it seems 'easier' with more options and bus services (even though it'll be busier and more expensive) but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something with the other options? Are there bus services I'm not seeing that anybody has taken or is aware about?    My Mum is 60 so we're a little hesitant to try skiing - obviously if we decide to downhill ski we will end up at Mt Buller but it's probably unlikely at this point.    Thanks in advance! ,Tabetha,Mount Buller,"Perth, Australia"

Thanks for everyone's previous inputs. Here is my draft kid-friendly itinerary for next February. I am seeking feedback. My partner does not like long driving so I would appreciate it if you have suggestions for better overnight stops.    (first few days in Hobart as business trips)    Day 1: Pick up rental car at 2 pm drive to Orford for a night  (no accommodation found in Triabunna at this moment so stay at Orford)    Day 2: Start 9 am East Coast Cruise one-day tour at Maria Island. After the tour finishes at 5 pm drive to BIG4 Iluka on Freycinet Holiday Park for an overnight stay  (will this drive be tiring and challenging or shall we stay somewhere closer to Triabunna?)  Plan B: If the weather is bad at Maria Island for the cruise will just go to Freycinet directly today.    Day 3: Freycinet (Honeymoon Bay Cape Tourville) Stay overnight at Saint Helens    Day 4: Bay of Fires in the morning (debate if to join the ‚ÄúBay of Fires Eco tour‚Äù for a 2-hour ride. Does Anyone know about it?)  Drive to Deloraine for an overnight stay (Is there any other better overnight stop between Bay of Fires and Cradle Mountain? I tend to avoid A3 after seeing some posts about its winding condition though.)    Day 5: Tasmazia & The Village Of Lower Crackpot Cradle Mountains short walk stay overnight at Cradle Mountains    Day 6: Beauty Point (seahorse museum Platypus house and then to Launceston stay overnight Launceston    Day 7: Launceston (need to return car at noon) Penn Royal Adventures Cataract Gorge Stay Overnight Launceston    Day 8: free morning until flight in the afternoon (any suggestion?)

We have tickets to see the fireworks from Dudley Page Reserve. It fit our budget and our needs Getting something ticketed was essential but there are 6 of us and we didn't want to blow the whole trip budget on something like a cruise. Especially when the kids just want to be able to see a few fireworks over the bridge. A picture of sunset at Dudley Page showed up on my Instagram and I thought why not NYE? We can see the skyline but probably won't hear the boom. Perfect! (the youngest is on the spectrum and loves the lights of fireworks but not the sounds of them going off)    What are some good options of things to do beforehand? Is Bondi a complete zoo on New Years Eve? Would the Foreshore Walk be a better option? Where's a good spot nearby to pick up picnic essentials and snacks? ,Mark W,Sydney,

Hello  I am a Greek citizen and recently I applied for the eVisitor Visa and it was rejected based on the following  Based on the information available at time of assessment I have not sighted any evidence in support of the applicants application to confirm that they meet the genuine visitor criteria including evidence of employment passport and sufficient funds.  Personally I have no intention in overstaying my visa in Australia.  I could apply again and provide all the information but the process seems lengthy and bureaucratic.    Regardless I opted for the ETA and it was granted to me instantly.    Do you believe that the rejection will cause me any problems when I arrive in Australia.

Hi folks we live in the UK our daughter who lives in Perth is having her 1st child in May 2024. My wife would obviously like to be there to help and support her. We would probably look to stay for 3 months. As I side issue as a holiday we have yet to try a cruise. We are thinking that maybe we could fly to somewhere Singapore ?? and take a 2/3 week cruise to Perth. Following our stay in Perth we would then re-locate to see out other daughter in Sydney for say a couple of weeks then home. So basically fly from UK cruise to Perth fly to Sydney then fly home. All help and recommendations gratefully accepted !! Regards Eddie ,steady_eddie_11,Perth,From Up North
hi last week i applied online for evisitor 651 tourist visa - this will be my fourth one. i have always received within a few minutes without any probs but not this time - all it says is that its been received. i did my sons at same time and his came through in seconds. however when rechecking i notice that in the section 'do you have a previous grant notification number' i have put the one from 2019 and not the one from last year by mistake . is this likely to have caused a prob? shall i send most recent one to them in notification of incorrect answers? could this delay even further ? do i cancel and restart or perhaps do ETA via app? i know its only a week but im panicking as never had a problem before ........im a worrier lol üò¢ ,Alison R,,"Sheffield, England..."

Hello we will be in Perth over new years with two young children. I have read that Elizabeth Quay is the place to be and is good for kids?  What is open on New Year‚Äôs Day? Is there much open? We are staying in the city.  We‚Äôre planning on going to Rottnest but also have a few days to fill up if anyone has any suggestions? Once we get to the city we won‚Äôt have access to a car.  Thank you ,Swimmer5000,Western Australia,"London, United..."
Many thanks for all your help in planning this trip! We will be spending December 30 in Port Arthur driving to Hobart later that day. I had hoped to stay overnight in Port Arthur but the Hobart hotel has a minimum stay over New Year's.  Would you recommend grabbing a dinner in Port Arthur before heading to Hobart? Or someplace between Port Arthur and Hobart? I'm guessing that Hobart will be packed.  Thanks for your help!! ,Patagonia2,Hobart,"New York City, New..."

Hi all - following such helpful advice here am now going to do Kimberely cruise Broome to Darwin in May/June 2025 probably with Prince Reef or Coral etc. I love self drive and think would enjoy a good 10-14 days doing so after the cruise. We have driven in many challenging countries but as now in our 70s not too keen on much risk taking any more! Your suggestions would be appreciated as don't really want to repeat the cruise itinerary but keen to stay in the Kimberley area. Realise can take an overland tour but we do prefer to be self sufficient unless it's definitely not advisable. Your help really much appreciated. ,Leighites,Kimberley Region,Leigh-on Sea...
Hi we‚Äôre planning a road trip next March. We hoped to go to the Jenolan Caves and stay a night there. Hubby emailed to ask about accommodation there and was told they will be closed due to roads being fixed.  Will the caves be closed as well? If not is there somewhere close to stay a night?  Thanks. ,aussiesharon12,New South Wales,melbourne
Can anyone make any suggestions for a few fun local casual restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne? CBD locations preferred!    Thank you. ,jrlaw10,,
This is not a question about where to best view fireworks - we spent the money on harbor view hotel rooms so we‚Äôve got that covered!    Rather I‚Äôm curious if there are any activities within walking distance of CBD/Potts Point that we can do in the morning before fireworks. I realize we would likely need to walk away from the harbor because the harbor will be full of people waiting for fireworks viewing. Happy to do my own googling if you have suggestions you‚Äôre not sure are open for the holiday but that you think might fit the bill.    Also - do you know how easy it is to get food on NYE in the city? Nothing fancy required. Restaurant or street vendor will do.    (Also - thank you to anyone who provided input on a post in early 2023 about my hotel issues‚Ä¶got everything solved and the hotel is honoring the original price they granted us! After all the madness I forgot to follow up!). ,Becky 25,Sydney,"Centennial, Colorado"

Checked in the Mandalay Luxury apartments. They are clean and a great location. The big pool was also huge and very warm. We got an amazing price for a two bedroom apartment. Front desk staff was very helpful. First full day was Sunday and there was a market in town. We got breakfast at Fresq (delicious) and walked over to the market. My daughter and I could have spent hours there but we wanted to get to the Daintree. We bought a cute dress earrings postcards and fresh watermelon juice. We met the boys and took our time strolling to our car. Drove to Mossman. We took the shuttle and did the short walk (lots of people but we weren't up for the longer walk) It was gorgeous but said no swimming that day. It was also cool out. Kept driving to Daintree ice cream. Nice place to stop and delicious local flavors. Pulled over as we went kept driving to see a cassowary in the wild! Drove to the Madja boardwalk and enjoyed the walk. So many amazing ferns and plants. We didn‚Äôt do a guided trip because we like to go at our own speed. In this case I kind of wish we had a guide to point things out but we still enjoyed it and read all the signs. Drove back and stopped at the playground in Mossman for my kids to run around. Got home and went to the Surfy for dinner. Next day we went out on Wavelength to the outer reef. Amazing day! The crew is great. Really clean boat with tons of space. I highly recommend them. They were great with the kids and just gave everyone time to enjoy the underwater world. Got home exhausted but went to Rattle n Hum for dinner and then grabbed ice cream. Next day was our day to do nothing. Took it easy and walked to breakfast at the Little Larder. We love all the poached eggs with toast. Spent some time in the local grocery store buying Jumpers Tastey Toobs Violet crumbles and chickadees. This is one of our favorite things to do when we travel‚Ä¶try all the local snacks. We loved them all! Did a little more shopping and I sent the kids back with my husband to swim at the hotel pool while I got a massage at Port Douglas Thai Massage on grant street. It was just what I needed and very reasonably priced. I should note given the current exchange rate with the US we feel like everything is reasonably priced. We all swam for a bit after and went to Chillys for the cane toad racing. It was fun but next time I wouldn‚Äôt get there early. There wasn‚Äôt really a need for a seat. We ate dinner there (good pizza and probably the best salad I‚Äôve had so far). We also could see bats from the restaurant which we thought was very cool. Next day we booked the Sailaway full day low isles day. We wanted to spend two days on the reef and this sounded like a good way to see a different part. My kids were tired so i stayed on the low isle with the younger one and then did the glass bottom boat with the older one. We had perfect weather but we were all tired. After we went to Viet Pho for dinner. It hit the spot. By the time we left at 6:30 there was a wait. Walked home and went to bed. Today we are on to Sydney. I think we could have spent one less day in PD but it was nice to have a down day. PD was a nice resort town but if someone is expecting upscale like Wailea or Princeville then its a bit different. I was also surprised by how little local fish is on menus. Maybe because fishing is restricted but I had hoped for more grilled fish simply prepared. We did love all the fresh fruit in the area and the GBR was spectacular. ,CalBear_02,Port Douglas,"San Francsico, CA"
Hi I wanted to ask people who live or spend time in PD or have been there in July if it is common for people to swim at the beach. I know it won't be packed with swimmers but are there any at all or is it just too cold?  Thanks in advance for any answers. ,Tash P,Port Douglas,"Melbourne, Australia"
We are in Noosa in late January. We would like to do a day trip to K'Gari. There are trips from Rainbow Beach but I wonder if any trips start from Noosa. Any suggestions welcome.

Thank you. ,harrowman55,Noosa,"London, United..."
We just returned from our trip to Australia and New Zealand which included a couple of days in Port Douglas and snorkeling tour booked with Quicksilver. I wanted to share our experience with this tour so that other are better prepared.    We booked this well in advance and chose to add the introductory snorkeling tour.    First the good things about the tour and Quicksilver. All the logistics at the port went smoothly. Cruise to the reef on the big catamaran was smooth and snorkeling equipment provided on the pontoon at the reef was fine.    Upon checking in with the guided snorkeling tour leader on the boat we were advised that if we are not comfortable with swimming for 45 minutes with the group we should perhaps not do this tour and they will refund it if we choose not to do it. None of us are strong swimmers so we were discussing this. At this time they suggested that perhaps the Ocean Walk helmet dive might suit us better since it involves no swimming.    So we talked to the person handling the Ocean Walk. We had no idea what it was. Person responsible explained that it was a pressurized helmet dive where in you dive and walk to the reef on a platform under water and will be guided by experienced scuba divers. We are assured that this would not interfere with any other activities that we want to at the reef. So we opted for this very expensive dive and opted out of guided snorkeling tour. This turned out to be a big mistake!    After a while we were give a time slot of 1pm for the dive. We were told to be at the dive platform 10 minutes before the slot and warned NOT to go any semi-sub tours (free) that start after 12.30pm.    The boat arrived at the pontoon a little after 12.00 and Quicksilver put out a pretty good lunch spread. We had a 1pm slot for the dive so we decided to eat lunch first which took 15-20 min. Since we were told we shouldn't get on the semi-sub tour after 12.30 and it would take too long to put snorkeling gear on and snorkel for a bit on our own we just hung around and decided to do the tour of the Underwater Observatory.    Underwater Observatory was the first let down. You go down the steps for may be 1 or 2 meters and there is a windowed chamber under the water that is a few meters long. There was no one there and that should've been a tip off that this is waste of time. We did not see anything through the windows other than the reef in the distance and the red fish they feed so that they hang around. Was very disappointed but the helmet dive should be fun right?    Next was helmet diving which we were very exited about. We put on the heavy gear and was lead down a stair case in to the water. This is where the scam unfolded. This wasn't any kind of Ocean Walk! You just stay on a platform under water (probably 3-4 meters below) holding on to a rail facing the reef. The guide with scuba gear will then perform some tricks for you such as feeding the same red fish that appear to hang around because they are used to the feeding and the guide blowing bubbles at you! You don't see any other marine life of the reef. They also take some pictures and video that they later try to sell!. That is it! So we paid as much as the actual cruise for this stupid trick and wasted all our time! It was 1.30pm by the time we got out and returned the gear.    We were told that we had till 2.00pm to return to the boat to leave. At this point we haven't done any meaningful reef activity and we only have a few minutes. There is a semi-sub tour at 1.40 and that was the last one. So we had to choose between doing some snorkeling on our own or do the sub tour and not do any snorkeling! We didn't travel half around the world to not snorkel on the GBR at all so we chose to do that. Our friends that were with us only did a few minutes of snorkeling and got on the last trip.    Snorkeling on the reef by ourselves was amazing. As we venture out on to the reef we were treated to tons of marine life and the beautiful reef itself. It would've been wonderful to spend more time doing that as opposed to wasting time with the Ocean Walk scam!!    Then our friends returned from the sub-tour and told/showed the magnificent views of the bustling reef they saw from the sub. We were mad that we missed that (free) tour because of the stupid helmet dive.    We are very disappointed that we spent thousands of dollars and days/hours of our time to get to GBR only to be scammed by the stupid helmet dive. I would've gladly paid more for the actual cruise instead of this scam.    Buyer beware and know what you are getting in to. If I were to do this again (which probably won't happen in my lifetime) I would skip lunch (it was good but takes time) and would stick with the guided tour. Keep in mind you only have about 2 - 2.5 hours at the reef and spend it wisely! ,SaratVemuri,Cairns Region,"Alpharetta, Georgia"

Hello everyone I am highly interested in jenolan caves. I will arrive at Sydney in the beginning of September 2024. In my group there will be couple seniors over 75. My mom (over 75) does not have issue on daily walking but she might might feel painful or tired on joints if she walk over 2 hours consecutively. In addition they don‚Äôt know how to swim. There will be also a 4 year old kid in my group. Could we still join a jenolan caves tour with your guide? Thanks in advance. ,Magkoo,Sydney,"Bellevue, Washington"

We are heading over mid January super excited.  1. Is it common to have to put down a deposit to make a restaurant reservation? What if you do then would like to cancel? I really can't seem to find what the rules are. I get the feeling making a few reservations in Port D is recommended.  2. What to wear on a Daintree/Cape Tribulation tour in the summer (we are booked already). Is it ok to wear TEVA like sandals or it is recommended to closed toe shoes like a sneaker? It is ok to wear short or are long pants recommended?  3. Anyone been here and if so did you spend a full day exploring? https://www.wildlifehabitat.com.au    Thank you! ,Christie M,Port Douglas,"Houston, Texas"
Hello    I am travelling to Melbourne and have already made the flight bookings. I will reach Melbourne on 24th Dec night and have 3 days to explore Melobourne and nearby attractions.    I was hoping to do trip as follows:    25th Dec - Phillip island tour with Penguin Parade  26th Dec- Great Ocean Road  27th Dec- Local attractions like MCG Hot spings yarra river cruise skydeck etc    I see that that although the penguin viewing is open on 25th Dec but none of the tours are operating on that day. Is there any tour that operates on 24th Dec?    I am a little skeptical to drive at night while returning back from Philip island due to no driving experience in Australia. So please let me know if there is any tour operator that could take 2 of us on 24th Dec. Thanks ,Shreyans B,Victoria,
We are planning to visit either one of these 2 parks mid of December.  Moonlit Sanctuary (Mornington Peninsula) VS Healesville Sanctuary (Yarra Valley)?    May I know which one is more suitable for families?  We are 2 adults + 3 kids (age 14yo 11yo and 8yo)?    Our preference should be close encounters or maybe some animal feeding like being able to feed the kangaroo or pet a rabbit for instance.

Hi  We will be in Australia next month and spend two nights in Lorne. From Lorne we plan to go to phillip island for one night and spend one night at surf beach. Assuming we leave early from Lorne (630-7am or so) would it be better to avoid traffic and take the ferry? Also if we take the 9am ferry do you suggest getting tickets in advance or is showing up 30 min in advance adequate? or just go take the roads through melbourne? plan to go to moonlit sanctuary for a few hours before going to our airbnb at Surf beach and rest before the penguins in the evening. ,clelbongSalem_Or,Melbourne,"Portland, Oregon"

Hi everyone    Many thanks for your detailed suggestions and trip reports in TripAdvisor. It helped us (my husband and I) to have an amazing two week vacation in Australia.    I am sharing the trip report in brief here if it helps any. If anyone requires further clarity of any day/activity please ask!    Broadly we spent 14 days in Australia and had three internal flights. SYD- MEL MEL- CNS CNS - SYD. We spent 3 days in Sydney 6 days in Melbourne 3 days in Cairns and ended with 2 days in Sydney again. Detailed report below:    First three days in Sydney:  Stay: We stayed in Megaboom City Hotel which was in a prime location for our interests and close to public transportation. Though the room felt small on first look the room and its furnishing was designed with attention to detail which made our stay very comfortable. Location and access to tram made the three days better.    Also there was a cafe right across the hotel where people on their way to offices were getting coffee and breakfast. We had our first coffee here everyday and enjoyed it.    Food: We found food to be quite expensive not just in Sydney but in most places in Australia.  In Sydney we ate in  1) Betty burgers 100m from the hotel where the burgers were quite tasty and filling for their prices.  2) Macchiato Pizza in Sydney CBD which had good ambience and cheesecake and was slightly expensive.  3) Beach cafe on coogee bondi beach walk  4) waston bay pub (expensive - meant for a relaxed lunch)  5) noodles from a shop in china town (I would not eat here again - the place felt unhygenic and the ambience took away the vacation vibe)  6) toast from cafe opposite Megaboom city hotel  7) picnic lunch from coles for blue mountain    Activities in brief:  Day 1: Taronga Zoo Harbor bridge walk (not climb) little walk in rocks  Day 2: Coogee to Bondi beach walk Sydney aquarium walking tour of Rocks  Day 3: Blue mountains (best part of Sydney travels)    Activities in detail:  Day 1: We landed in Sydney at 10:30 AM. Post purchasing SIM (Optus - where the majority of crowd was buying from; could not find telstra dedicated store) and Opal card (just before the gates to enter the train platform) we reached our hotel around 1 PM. We found the airport transportation to be costly (~36 AUD for 2 people) and were surprised to see that we could have hired a cab on Uber for few more dollars and saved us the 500 m walk from train station to hotel.    Post quick lunch at Betty's burgers we took the tram from QVB to Circular Quay and a ferry from there to Taronga Zoo. We found the ferry to be convenient cutting the requirement to travel on long winded roads and inherent traffic. Taronga Zoo was one of the best things we did in Australia. With peacocks walking around leisurely and tigers playfully falling on each other and with a lion staring into my eyes for few minutes and running towards me as if the glass seperation doesn't exist between us (shivering as a right this) and happiest looking giraffees and the views of harbour bridge and opera behind them... I can go on and on about what makes the taronga zoo special. We did Sydney Acquarium the next day and it was no way closer to Taronga Zoo. Tip for Taronga Zoo: After getting down from Ferry take the bus to get to the upper level of Zoo. Makes it easier to walk downhill in the zoo than uphill - tip taken from tripadvisor thank you folks!)    Post Taronga Zoo we took the ferry back to Circular Quay. Realizing that the ferry was next headed to Milsons point we stayed back in the ferry and got down at Milsons point. Enjoyed the walk from Milsons point to the lift to harbour bridge. We walked next to a neighborhood which had trees with lavender flowers and cafes/churches etc. The walk on the bridge from milsons point towards circular quay was eventful - with light drizzle and the lights on the bridge getting on midway into the bridge. The lamps on the bridge were looking majestic. We enjoyed the views from the bridge and the evening breeze. We used the lift near rocks to get down and walked from there to circular quay tram enjoying the outdoor dining views and in some cases live music.    Day 2: We planned to reach coogee beach for sunrise (5:45 AM) and we rather reached it by 7 AM post having our first coffee from the cafe across the hotel. Inspite of reaching late the walk from Coogee to Tamarama beach was almost secluded except for locals jogging and was the most magical part of the beach walk. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the freshness of the air and views cleanliness of the pathways and were in amazing energy till we reached Tamarama beach where our stomachs started growling sun started making his presence felt and the tourists were being touristy. We had a quick breakfast at Tamarama beach cafe and relaxedly explored the sculptures by the sea with a cold beverage in hand. For people with very little exposure to arts I must say that exploring 100+ sculptures placed between Tamarama beach and Bondi beach with interpretation to each sculpture available to buy in print or for free available on their app was an enriching experience. We were amazed with the clarity and the ease with which few sculptures were expressing very complex thoughts.    Post a quick look at bondi beach (and people surfing in it) we took a bus to watson bay for lunch. The lunch was okay (with us being vegetarians the options were minimal). The saving point was the ferry from watson bay to circular quay which definitely was a very convenient way to travel vs taking a bus.    Sidney Acquarium was uneventful except for Dugong Pig active penguins and nesting penguins.    We booked a walking tour for rocks however found it not meeting to our requirements and strolled around rocks/china town on our own for the rest of the evening.    Day 3 (Best day of the trip):  After a coffee and avocado toast from the cafe across the hotel we boarded the train to katoomba from Sydney Central. The folks in the station (I think employees of railways) were quite helpful with few questions we had. We had a relaxing two hour travel to Katoomba with folks around us in deep discussions about their day to day lives.    After we reached katoomba while most that got down immediately took a bus to reach the information center we decided to take a walk around and looked for coles for picnic lunch. This is where discovered the fresh orange juice machine of coles for the first time (and looked for it everywhere we went to in Australia). The 1L of fresh and infinitely refreshing orange juice was easily worth the $6. We quickly bought some food for lunch and headed back to bus stop. Surprisingly we waited for ~30-45 minutes to catch the bus (it was supposed to be every 20 minutes as per information board at bus stop). We were surprised to see few homeless people on the roads and had deep discussions on it while waiting for the bus.    We reached the information center where the folks were resourceful and very helpful. Though I had few researched walks in mind we decided to walk to Katoomba cascades (which was one hour return). This walk was pleasant with views of three sisters. However this walk was slightly crowded and sometimes noisy. After reaching cascades I felt this cannot be the falls and looked around/asked around for falls. Most people were not aware of any other falls. I came across an old information board which stated that falls were further walk down. After much convincing we decided to walk further and look for falls. Within few 100ms of walking we could catch a glimpse of the falls. We looked across and saw that there were people way ahead of us and their spot would provide us complete view to the falls. We walked for next 30 minutes and reached this spot. It gave us the complete view of majestic Katoomba falls.    Post this we relaxed on near by benches for a while and enjoyed some snacks we bought from Coles. We were surprised to see that the walk ended and we had energy in us to explore further. We found a pathway with caution as incomplete trail and we saw two people entering this pathway. We decided to try it out and ventured to what would be the best thing about our day in blue mountains. The trail is incomplete compared to the boardwalks in rest of bluemountain however we found it to be complete in the sense of a trail in a forest. We later discovered that this was Furber steps and this part of blue mountains was the most original part of the day for us. There were barely any people and we spent amazing two hours (climb down and climb up) in this secluded and beautiful place. The climb back did test our stamina but it was totally worth the experience.    We walked to scenic world car park to take the bus to train station. Reached the station bus stop and had a beer each at a very pretty bar right next to the bus stop. Took the train back to Sydney and reached in two hours.

Good day so I am going to land in Perth around 1PM but then I have a whole day in Perth and need to be back to the airport because I am staying the night at the Perth airport sleeping pod. With that said I would like to get out of the airport and do things a little bit before heading back to the airport. I have been to Perth before but I am looking to see if there's anything else easy to reach that maybe worth going to besides the City Center. Is there a beach that I can go to  perhaps via public transportation? ,travelbie,Perth,New Orleans...

I am looking for suggestions on towns to stay overnight for this trip. We want to see the penguins visit the hot springs and enjoy coastal towns and walks. Please suggest other places to visit for families with older children.      Last year we did the GOR with a night in Geelong a night in Apollo Bay and a night in Warrnambool this was a good pace for us. We also have 4 nights in Melbourne as part of this trip so am looking to spend the full 6 days out of the city.    Thank you ,Jayne C,Victoria,"Perth, Australia"
I am transiting through Melbourne airport by Quantas. Have valid visa.    Can the luggage be through checked in to my destination or does Australia have any rule which requires claiming luggage passing through customs environmental clearance and checking in again? Thanks ,Pacific Wanderer,,
My husband and I were hoping to rent bikes and ride the Capital City Trail while we're in Melbourne next month. But I've read that there are multiple closures and detours along the trail without clear detour signs so that someone unfamiliar with the area (like us) would get lost. Is this still the case? If so will it be any better in January? ,flojo93,Melbourne,"Brooklyn, New York"

Hi I am flying from Canada through Brisbane on my way to Perth in early December. I got an insane deal in business class coming through Brisbane vs Sydney but I have a full day layover from 8 am to 6 pm.

Any suggestions or thoughts on pros and cons of this?  Thanks! ,Lisawinnipeg,Brisbane,"Winnipeg, Canada"

Would like to find a good website to research this area. We are 70 + years so hiking is not an option but leisurely walks certainly are within our capabilities. ( 2 -4 Km ) One place already identified is Wallaman falls . So is it a short walk or a hike ?

Is it true that I will be able to use my card to pay for almost everything including taxis and convenience stores like 7-Eleven? I'm arriving next week for my first visit to Oz.

Dear all    May I seek everyone's advice please? We are 2A1C 11 years old driving to GoldCoast on 22/11.    Realized that we are running into the schoolies crowd => oversight :(((    Our tentative plan is to spend a week as followed :  23/11 : Sea world  24/11 : Paradise Country  Dinner + show : Australian outbreak  25/11 (sat) : Weekend markets  SURFER Paradise - Q1 observatory shopping  26/11 : Cummin Wildlife Sanctuary  27/11 : Movie world  28/11: Half day ... either go beach or shopping..then drive to Brisbane city after lunch.      We are flexible as we have not bought the tickets.    Read online (based on past years and pre-covid times) Schoolies period : to avoid Surfer Paradise Pacific Fair shopping centre and Harbour Town. Still valid this year?    Questions :  1) in this case should we stay in Broadwater or Burleigh Heads or other place? We hope to be near eating shopping places preferably near beach. Looking at apartment with cooking and washing machine :) Initial plan was surfer paradise but now have to give a miss. Budget 300+/-    2) Will the theme parks be crowded? Someone recommends it's safe if we enter before 10am We are unlikely to take adventure rides. Theme parks visit mainly for our kid! OR maybe we just do one park for experience.    3) Cummin wildlife VS  David Fleay Wildlife Park VS  Lone pine koala sanctuary (in Brisbane) VS  paradise country    We wonder if these are overlapped. We have watched sheep shearing in previous Perth farm-stay trip.    If yes probably we can change to a trip day to O'Reilly's Rainforest. Hope to hear your thoughts please :)    4) weekend market : any recommendations for 25/11? Is parking available on site?    5) Lego bricks toy - in term of collection/variety: should we buy in GC or Brisbane city?      Million million thanks! ,radiance123,Brisbane,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi I am a British Citizen and applied for a eVisitor Visa and it got refused after 5 days saying ‚ÄúBased on the information available at time of assessment I have not sighted any evidence in support of the applicants application to confirm that they meet the genuine visitor criteria including evidence of employment passport and sufficient funds.‚Äù    I am really confused. The eVisitor Visa does not have any questions about funds or require to submit evidence of employment. It literally has no facility for attaching any documents. It doesn‚Äôt even ask how much money I have or where I am employed.    So how can my Visa be refused on these grounds? I called the British High Comission and the Global Processing helpline in Australia and they said they cannot provide any information or discuss any results of an application.    What can I do? Has anyone been in this situation? I am due to fly in a week. ,Londoner5869,,"London, England..."

Hello! We want to stay in Melbourne for 1 week in April. Looking at AirBnb and having a hard time deciding which neighborhood would be the best for an apartment rental. Many websites suggest first time visitors stay in the CBD but maybe that is only for people staying a night or two in a hotel. We don't want to be in an office area that empties out at night but also don't want to be too far from the all the things that I'm sure we'll want to see. Besides general touristing we like to run and cycle eat & drink (though too old for bars and a night scene) beaches and walk or use public transportation to get around. Seems like South Yarra Southlands and Fitzroy might be what we're looking for. Also see mentions of Docklands and not sure if that would be another good spot. Would love your opinion. Thanks! ,HKCunli,Melbourne,"Atlanta, Georgia"

As a Perth resident I thought I would issue a warning regarding some extortionate markups in our local restaurants.    We all know that restaurants mark up their wine and this is where some of their profit comes from. However a 100% plus markup in my view is unacceptable. I will not give my custom where the markup us more than 60%. Easy to check just look at the wine list and then google the same wine. Winery restaurants are usually good value but not all! ,rwlid,Perth,"Perth, Australia"

Hello beautiful people can you advise on the below?    I‚Äôm a 45-year-old female traveling solo and planning to spend 3 weeks in Oz maybe 4. I‚Äôll be going April-May and might have 13 hours of jet lag upon arrival ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know yet.    I‚Äôd like to visit the below cities and areas but it might be too many places and some might need to go lest the trip will feel rushed; add that to my potential grogginess the first few days due to jet lag and it doesn‚Äôt bode for a happy experience. But I might be wrong ‚Äìyou‚Äôll know better than me. If the below isn‚Äôt doable in 3 weeks but is in 4 please tell me.    If it helps determine what to keep and what do drop my likes are beaches outdoors art culture history food geopolitics learning about different cultures and interacting with locals. If I need to choose beautiful beaches will take priority over beautiful mountains and lakes. I‚Äôll be coming from Argentina which has plenty of great mountains lakes and forests.    So based on the below list can you suggest your optimal itineraries based on lowest travel time between cities or regions and indicate how many days you‚Äôd spend at each location? As before feel free to remove some if you feel it‚Äôs too cramped and I could do without based on my likes and priorities. I probably won‚Äôt be renting a car. I feel a tad apprehensive of driving by myself on the left side of the road a new experience for me.    If you think I should add other places to the list please add them to your itineraries and drop whatever will have to go. Thanks so much!

We had planned to pre-book AirTrain but just discovered that there is an interruption on the date we will arrive. Looking at the next inexpensive option which seems to be the Shared Shuttle  Con X ion. Do we need to pre-book or can you just walk up to the Con X Ion kiosk at the airport and book it then?

I‚Äôm in the early stages of planning a short trip of about 8 ‚Äì 9 nights to Tas just after Easter next year.    A key focus of the trip will be to spend 3 - 4 nights in Hobart namely Friday Saturday Sunday and maybe Monday night. This will enable us to visit Salamanca Market on Saturday morning and then catch a ferry to Mona in the afternoon.    I have short listed to hotels which appear to be within walking distance to Salamanca place and the Hobart waterfront which offer free parking which will be handy as we will be taking our own vehicle over to Tas on the SPOT.    The hotels I‚Äôm looking at are St Ives apartments in Battery Point and the RACV Hotel in Collins St.    I‚Äôm leaning towards the St Ives Apartments which seems to be the cheaper of the two even though I am entitled to a discount at the RACV Hotel. I would appreciate any input on the pros and cons of both hotels and whether there are any other options nearby. TIAü§†    As a late add there will be two possibly three of us travelling. ,Famrick,Tasmania,Geelong...
I applied for 6 eVisitor visa through ImmiAccount over a week ago. Three were granted instantaneously but 3 are still marked as 'received'. I have not been asked for any further documentation. All I supplied was a photo of our passports.  The current processing wait time is supposedly 24 hours max. I called their helpline in Canberra this morning to be advised just to wait.  This seems a bit risky to me..  Does anyone know if it's possible to apply for an ETA visa now even though I have the eVisitor applications still pending? ,macroneycarol,,

Hi  We are coming in to Cairns on 20th December and have our GBR tour booked for 22nd. We are flying out of Cairns to Sydney on 23rd at 6:30pm.

Hi all I posted a few months ago and a couple of years ago (before we had to cancel due to covid). I have had to tweak the itinerary alittle as it will be at a much slower pace now we have an infant (5 months when she arrives in Sydney). I have visited Sydney before but it was around 14 years ago now.    I booked hotels on free cancellation and originally booked the Capella and the Intercontinental (on points). I think after a few emails discussing our reservation we are going to stick with the Intercontinental.    We will land in Sydney at around 19:00 on Jan 22 (coming from the UK). I have had a look at transport options and it appears using the airport link would be absolutely fine. I understand I won‚Äôt need an opal card and me and the wife can just use a separate bank card to tap in/tap out.    It looks like the Intercontinental is very close to Circular Quay station and will be a good base for 4 nights. Having read the reviews on the breakfast at the hotel and read about the superb places to eat for breakfast we will be venturing out to eat breakfast each morning.    So far I have these ideas:  Day 1 - Botanic gardens opera house tour Harbour bridge pylon lookout and museum. Walk over to Luna Park Sea life aquarium    Day 2 - Do the coastal walk from Coogee to Bondi. I see you can get a tram to Randwick from Circular Quay. Would I be better off just getting the bus to Coggee? Am I right in saying that although there are some steps a stroller is okay on the route?  I see you can then get the bus to Watsons Bay on the Bus from Bondi then catch the ferry back. I will have to play that by ear on the day and see if that is too much or not.  Day 3 - ferry across to Manly.    All 3 days can be subject to change and can be moved around depending on weather. That‚Äôs my general plan though.    On the Friday morning we will have a few hours before catching a Domestic flight up to Brisbane to then go to Noosa.    My wife mentioned the Olympic park (I did visit it years ago) but maybe someone can recommend if it‚Äôs worth it or not now. Our thoughts on the zoo were that we were going to Australia Zoo in Queensland instead but again thoughts and opinions are very much appreciated.    Many thanks  Rich ,Richard K,Sydney,

I'll be in Victoria and Tasmania for about 3 weeks starting in mid-January. I have my visa already :) I'm a solo traveler -- 55 year old woman. Adventurous outdoorsy very experienced hiker/backpacker flexible in accommodations -- I'm happy with anything from camping to luxury but enjoy places with an outdoor element more than a luxury hotel in a city. :) The irony is that I'm arriving in Australia via a cruise ship from NZ largely so I could see all 3 main NZ sounds.    I will spend the 3ish weeks around Melbourne/Tasmania then meet up with friends in Sydney for a week and will return to NZ after that for a guided 3-week hiking trip in the interior of NZ.    I'd love some Victoria/Tasmania itinerary advice: Thank you in advance!    Here's my current plan:    Saturday 13 Jan (8 hour port call): Explore Melbourne via free self-guided walking tours as posted in other threads. Hope to go to National Gallery but I wonder if the Melbourne museum might be a better place to start my time in Australia. Lunch in Chinatown or Queen Victoria Market.    Jan 16: Disembark in Sydney. Fly to Melbourne hire car for a week drive to Yarra Valley.    2 nights Yarra Valley at a B&B with a 5 acre preserve. Will have one afternoon then one full day plus another morning to explore the area. I know I'll need to decompress after the cruise and this seems like an ideal place to do that. Drive to Hall's Gap (4-5 hours) leaving around noon on checkout day.    2 nights Hall's Gap (Th/Fr nights)-- gives me one full day and one half day to hike at Grampians. Pinnacle Venus Baths Mackenzie Falls Balconies are all under consideration.Anything else you recommend? Leave around 1 PM toward Port Campbell via great ocean road. GPS has me getting on GOR after Peterborough. Hope to see sunset at 12 apostles.    1 night(Saturday) Port Campbell. Then hike Cape Otway area and stop a lot for sights on GOR.  1 night (Sunday) Apollo Bay or Lorne -- Hike some of Great Ocean Walk near Apollo Bay in morning then drive car with stops along GOR to MEL and return it. Travel to rental airbnb in Melbourne that evening    6 nights/5 full days at airbnb in CBD Melbourne. Hope to see Australian Open one day one day (Friday) I'll enjoy celebrating Australia Day/public holiday and I want to do a tour to penguin parade. Two other days for independent exploration/museums/skydeck/river tour.    Fly to Hobart Tasmania.  2 nights Hobart Hotel -- hope to do a day tour to Maria Island or Port Arthur on a full day in Hobart.  4 nights -- 5-day Guided tour of Tasmania (Gordon River or Rainforest Mt Field NP Cradle Mt Bay of Fire Wineglass Bay)  1 night Hobart Hotel then fly to Sydney to meet American friends for a week before heading back to NZ.    I'm exhausted after seeing this typed out. Should I cut something/extend something/add something? I wanted to go to Kangaroo Island but it doesn't seem to fit esp. since I'd have to fly there and back. I only have one full day on GOR plus a few hours one afternoon and a half day/partial day from Apollo Bay to MEL.    Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. This is a bucket-list trip for me and I can't wait.    Note: I'll come back another time to explore Cairns the GBR Uluru and the North and West Coasts. January didn't seem like the right time for those. ,intrepidtraveler,Melbourne,"Longmont, Colorado"
Hello this will be a part of the larger itinerary (~ 20 days) covering parts of Australia. For clarity I will be visiting Sydney Cairns Uluru and final stop will be Melbourne for 2 days and then on a trip of the GOR for 3 nights (as wisely suggested in an earlier post) Party of 5 (35M 33 F 2F 65M 60F) will be self driving.    I have done some reading and my potential itinerary will be:  Day 1 (1 Apr): Drive from Melbourne stay at Apollo Bay and visit on the way: Torquay Erskine Falls Bells beach Split Point ligthouse Kennett river koala walk (not necessarily in that order)    Day 2 (2 Apr): Apollo Bay stay at Port Campbell: visit on the way: Cape Otway lightstation Gibson Steps London Bridge 12 Apostles (again not necessarily in that order)    Day 3 (3 Apr): I want to go to the Grampians and visit Halls Gap and would request suggestions of what to look at on this day. I can get accomodation there. We would not be doing a lot of hiking (nothing more than 2 miles round)    Day 4 (4 Apr): I have a flight back at 3 PM from Melbourne Airport.    I know this is a very touristy itinerary and I would really appreciate pointers on niche things to do. Is skydiving possible / recommended anywhere here? ,Chinmay D,Victoria,"Pune, India"

The odyssey to the dreamland finally came to fruition on Nov 7th when I boarded a flight to Doha and continued to Melbourne. On the flight to Melbourne I sat next to this oversized man and his son (also oversized). When we took off from the tarmac the man fell asleep and the cacophony of his snore drew attention. Right then I knew the 13-hour flight to Melbourne would feel like 13 days. Half of his right arm and shoulder were on my chest and he had these seemingly synchronized jolts that would kick in every few seconds where he would throw an elbow to my ribcage. While awake we had the chance to talk. He was a Coptic Christian from Syria living in Melbourne and I genuinely enjoyed chatting with him but his sleeping situation was unbearable. The flight attendant noticed the circumstance I was dealing with and offered to move me to a middle seat somewhere. Still I always ask for an aisle seat so I put up with the misery and remained awake for the entire flight (his loud snores still ringing in my ears). During breakfast time I told him how lucky he was for sleeping well on a flight. He told me once before he fell asleep while standing at a bus stop and missed the bus (we both laughed hard). So far so good until we landed in Melbourne and I passed the immigration and commenced toward the baggage claim. The Carousel for my flight was full of luggage and more was coming onto it.  I waited a long while until the conveyor belt stopped and I realized I had no luggage. I reported to the baggage counter in the arrival area and they asked me a list of questions filed a claim and mentioned I would hear from the airline within 48 hours. I caught the Skybus service to CBD and a short tram ride to the hotel. The reception staff at the hotel were exceptionally sensitive to my situation and provided me with a toothbrush and a pair of slippers. It was 9:30 p.m. I went out for dinner and when I returned to the room the reality started to sink in. I had no bedtime clothing nothing to shave with in the morning and no clean clothes to wear the next day. In the morning I rushed to a shopping center across the street from the hotel and bought a few necessities for a few days. I returned to my room showered shaved wore fresh clean clothes and headed for breakfast.  After breakfast I purchased a Vodafone SIM card and went to the airport to speak with the airline's luggage department. They said they found my luggage and it would arrive tomorrow (Nov 10th) at 18:30. I felt ecstatic and returned to Melbourne to pursue my itinerary. Alas there was no luggage the next day Nov 10th (false claim). I went back to the airport on Nov 11th and the airline mentioned that according to our system they loaded your luggage onto the plane to Melbourne but we couldn't find it so they needed more time. The entire time the weather was very cataclysmic. One morning the temperature reached 90 F; the subsequent day it was in the low 60s F. During the last trip to the airport I got the chills from the cold for not having warm clothing and by the next day Nov 12th I had the coughs and fever. I stopped at the pharmacy purchased some over-the-counter cough and fever suppressants and rested in my room all day. That evening an airline agent from the Melbourne team called and mentioned my luggage was no longer traceable and asked me to file an online claim. She said the airline policy is to compensate missing bags up to USD 150 (not very promising). I purchased a prepaid credit card before my trip to Australia but never budgeted enough to replace my luggage and personal belongings. At the same time I had packed enough daily medication in my knapsack to last me for a few days and the remaining medications were in the missing luggage. It was a hopeless situation: missing luggage fever cold lack of daily medication and an upcoming flight to Sydney the next day (NOV 13th) brought me an unprecedented level of anxiety. The next morning I dragged myself out of bed to shop for a few clothing items and a carry-on luggage before heading to the Avalon Airport. Upon arrival in Sydney I felt physically and emotionally run down and decided to catch a taxi to my hotel. I wanted this holiday to come to an end yesterday. Once nestled in the back of the cab I received a phone call from the airline team in Melbourne. They said a suitcase in San Francisco resembled the description I had given about my missing luggage so they emailed me the photo and indeed it was my lost bag. Long story short the airline managed to transfer the suitcase from San Francisco and deliver it to me at the hotel in Sydney in the early hours of Nov 16th.  I executed about 40% of my itinerary in Melbourne and Sydney before returning home on Nov 19th. Both cities are lovely and the people are exceptional (friendly helpful and kind). I am still recovering from the cold and planning another trip to Australia with my mother in February 2024 so wish me luck :-) ,hrh747,Sydney,"Tehran, Iran"

We‚Äôll be in Sydney mid March 2024. Next stop will be Albury to meet friends. We like trains but the reviews of the NSW Trainlink for this route have discouraging reviews for service and equipment. It is not clear if Albury is one of the stations that had a checked luggage depot. We understand many only post unfavorable reviews so additional information would be helpful. The other option is Quanta‚Äôs from Sydney to Albury with only one plane a day arriving late evening. In addition one of us has limited ability for walking long distances. ,Jeff,Sydney,"Denver, Colorado"

We will be traveling around Australia from mid-December through the end of April next year.    Our trip thus far includes a cruise circumnavigating Australia; the Indian Pacific and The Ghan train journeys; an RV trip along the southern coast from Melbourne to Perth; a drive north from Sydney to Cairns; an expedition cruise in the Kimberleys; and several days in Uluru. These bits and pieces are all planned out.    Before we head home on 1 May we have three days at the end of April that are not planned out ex-Sydney. I am looking for suggestions on where to go to just relax for a couple of days before the long flight back to the USA.    Ideally we'd like to drive not much more than 3 hours ... perhaps south or inland from Sydney since we'll be doing the drive up to Cairns earlier in our trip. Beautiful scenery with a few easy things to do in the vicinity would be great. Not into shopping.    I'll keep looking myself but any suggestions would be welcome. Thanks in advance. ,eenusa,New South Wales,Colorado
Pulled the trigger and am visiting Sydney for Christmas and NYE with a mate of mine who‚Äôs never been to Australia. Originally when I was going solo I was just planning on staying in Sydney since I‚Äôve been to other spots in Australia like Gold Coast Cairns Uluru Tasmania and Melbourne. Now with him coming for the first time I worry that if we stay in Sydney he won‚Äôt have the advantage of seeing other parts - as a first timer would you feel shortchanged coming all this way from the US and staying in Sydney? I think he‚Äôs okay - maybe I‚Äôm just projecting onto him. I have no doubt we‚Äôll be able to fill 10 full days over Christmas and New Years staying in the greater Sydney area. I had toyed with squeezing Brisbane in (but wonder if it‚Äôs too similiar to Sydney) and a friend recommended Noosa which looks amazing. But in the end it‚Äôs holidays I know places will be packed and lodging is expensive. I did find a reasonable booking in Noosa but with the extra flying time and cost of flights are we better off staying in Sydney.    I‚Äôve done tons in Sydney and if I stayed the whole time there I‚Äôd consider day trips or overnights to places outside I‚Äôve never done (the only place I‚Äôve done outside the Sydney area was Blue Mountains):    - Royal National Park  - Grand Pacific Drive including the Illawarra Coast and Southern Highlands - maybe stay overnight in Kiama or even down to Jervis Bay (would it be best to combine the above two in one overnight trip if we plan on leaving early one day and coming back late the next night?)  - Ku-ring Gai NP (I think this is the one that was on my list north of Sydney but I may have this wrong)    Which one of these are fine for day trips and which ones should I stay overnight? Maybe I combine all the south of Sydney attractions and just rent a car and go for a couple of days.    While in Sydney we‚Äôll do the obligatory Bondi my favorite Manly Sydney Harbor Toranga Zoo etc. And of course do various coastal hikes treks beaches. beaches. The one thing is where is it best to go somewhere to see koalas and kangaroos outside of Toranga Zoo?    Thanks ,CSquaredC2,Sydney,San Francisco...

Hello    I know this doesn't directly apply to Australia but I'm flying out there next week. Can I get by with Medical Only Travel Insurance? Usually when I travel I buy plans that cover trip cancelation/interruption but my Flight and Hotels are cancelable anyways. The Medical Only plans are much cheaper and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of money buying the full plans. ,Steve P,,"Green Bay, Wisconsin"
Hello all forgive me in advance this will be a bit long but I feel this is the way to go in TA forums and I have always been richly awarded with maximum information from the community the more I share. So: we will be a group of 5 (35M 33F 2F 65M and 60F) travelling to Australia in late March - early April: tentatively 18/19 March - 5 April. This is me my spouse daughter and parents. All of us are healthy and enjoy travelling. Parents primarily eat vegetarian food. Collectively we like nature more as compared to cities.    I have made a tentative itinerary which still needs finishing touches but I would like to get the community's advise before I really set it in stone. Following is what I have planned:    Day 1: Land in Sydney transport to hotel (have not booked looking at places in CBD as per forum's advise)  Day 2: Sydney: Day tour in the city Opera House Harbour bridge cicular quay walk from Bondi beach to Coogee beach  Day 3: Day trip to Blue mountains by rail. I would have only one day here so would it be better to rent a car for the day or go by rail?  Day 4: Visit the Taronga zoo some shopping  Day 5: Travel to Ayers rock rent a car  Day 6: Do the sunrise walking tour of Uluru maybe the night dining experience? Would like advise here  Day 7: Hot air balloon ride over Uluru and then fly to Melbourne  Day 8 & 9: City attractions in and around Melbourne  Day 10 & 11: Drive the GOR overnight stay at a suitable place (yet to decide)  Day 12: Travel to Cairns  Day 13: Spend a full day at the GBR helicopter ride if feasible snorkelling boat ride  Day 14: Drive to and spend time at Daintree National forest  Day 15: Drive to Cape tribulation fly to Hobart  Day 16 & 17: Road trip in Hobart (Yet to finalize places but have read quite a bit about it)  Day 18: Fly back to Melbourne  Day 19: Fly out    Some questions I have:  1. Regarding car rentals in Cairns and Melbourne does it make sense to rent cars for the entire duration or only when really needed to like the GOR (Melbourne) and Daintree + Cape tribulation (Cairns)  2. Is it possible to do Daintree and Cape Tribulation in a day? We are not very big on hikes so maybe a small one and then stop for views / experiences is what we would prefer especially with a 2 year old in tow.  3. We are keen on interacting with kangaroos and koalas and either the zoo in Sydney or during the GOR drive is when it will be possible is what I have gathered. Any better options which can be clubbed with this?  4. Is it worth carrying a stroller with the child she is already pretty independent with walking etc. How stroller friendly would the areas be where we are travelling?  5. The order of visiting places is based on optimizing flight costs as and when possible.  6. Is this above itinerary really doable or am I in over my head? ,Chinmay D,,"Pune, India"
Hi TripAdvisor!    Tomorrow is my last full day in Sydney before I head back home (Portland Oregon USA). My flight is 12 pm on Tuesday 26/11.    My plan tomorrow is a harbor bridge tour from 17:00 - 18:00 and before that I am free most of the day.    So far I have done an Opera House Tour (and saw a play) went to the museum of NSW went to Featherdale Zoo and Blue Mountains (which was so beautiful) and probably some other things I‚Äôm missing.    Unless you think I could fit Taronga and Manly together tomorrow I think I would only have time for 1 (unless I could wake up super early for the airport and go super early to one of them?).    Any advice on which one to choose? Taronga would be nice to maybe see a platypus and I heard the view is amazing and similar for Manly. ,Blaire P,,"Portland, Oregon"

I‚Äôm helping a friend plan a last minute trip and would appreciate some pointers to assist her.    Thoughts so far-    Arrives Adelaide Christmas Day and probably wants to stay a week or so. Stay perhaps CBD for a few days. Ideally hotel with pool. Thoughts?    Then shift somewhere- maybe Victor Harbour? Beach side somewhere? Somewhere out of city. Imagine issue might be as per WA popular beach areas could already be booked up    Solo traveller in her 40s - not big budget ( less than $200 per night) She‚Äôs just wanting a change of scene from Perth and never been to SA. Maybe hire a car for some of the time. Not interested in wineries.    Many thanks for any ideas. ,JeanPerth,South Australia,"Albany, Australia"

We are travelling to Australia in February 2024. We land on the 6th Feb and on the 8th we embark on a cruise to New Caledonia for 8 days. My question is when filling out the Incoming Passenger card do I just put 2 days for the length of time in Australia? We will be returning to Australia and staying for 2 months so I assume we will be given another IPC to complete. I know it seems obvious but I want to get it right.

Hi  Thanks to you all who advised to my initial question on the itinerary I am kind of finalizing the itinerary. I am starting a new thread just for the Melbourne part just to not overload my initial question. Here is what I have so far    Day 1: Arrive from US - flight lands at 9;30am. Booked an accommodation in CBD. Relax and City sight seeing - Flinders station Federation Square Skydeck Southbank Promenade.. (Want to see main landmarks to get an idea of the city)    Day 2: Start from Melbourne CBD and drive to Philip Island. I have booked the penguin parade- Ranger tour for the night. Overnight stay at Cowes. Would you advise doing Moonlit sanctuary or Healsville sanctuary on the way to see native animals?    Day 3: Drive to the ferry at Sorrento and cross the bay to Queenscliff.  Do I have to prebook these ferry?    Points to stop: Torquay Front Beach Cape Patton lookout Airey's inlet Kennett River Apollo Bay Mait's rest rainforest walk Over night in Great Otway/Apollo Bay. (I keep reading that you can see koalas in Great Otway. How and where can we see them? Is there like an overnight tour or something where we can view them? As you can see we are crazy about seeing kangaroos and koalas :) )    Day 4: Great Otway Light Station Great Otway Park 12 Apostles Razorback Island Archway Loch Ard Gorge. Drive Inland route to Melbourne aiport - Flight at 7:45pm.    I understand we may have to cut some of these if we are tired/jetlagged etc.. If so which ones would you recommed to cut? Anything that is not in there that should be added? I dont think we have time to do Halls Gap as we do not want to leave the same day we land in Melburne after a 17 hr flight..    Thanks again for all your time and advise. Truly appreciate it!    Cheers! ,HelloWorldTraveler1,Melbourne,San Francisco...

Hi all I have posted on the Sydney forum and just trying to get ideas and make sure our plans are okay. I have visited Noosa around 13 years ago but I read it as changed considerably since then. We had originally booked to stay in Noosa in 2020 but was cancelled. We will have to change our plans a little to accommodate the little one.    We are from the UK. There are 3 of us myself my wife and a 5 month infant. We are flying from Sydney where we will have had 4 nights and land in Brisbane at around 15:00 Friday Jan 26th. We are flexible on everything else so just want to make sure we are on the right lines with our 3 night stay. We have hiring a car with Avis from the Airport (free cancellation) and then dropping it back off on the Monday at around 14:00. We will then take the airport train into the city for 2 nights in Brisbane before then flying to Fiji.    For our stay in Noosa I booked Sofitel on free cancellation. It looks to have solid reviews (apart from the odd one star). I believe the hotel as parking for a fee. We were thinking possibly going to the zoo but as we won‚Äôt have too long we do want to ‚Äúchill‚Äù somewhat. I know there are walks we could do and I will go through my original plans but was just looking for insight and opinions etc.    P.s I do hope Noosa is fantastic as it was when I visited before. ,Richard K,Noosa,
I just wanted to give a little trip report in case it helps anyone else in their planning. This may seem weird but I actually never had to ask any questions on this forum as I planned my trip! I read a few trip reports but you regular posters gave me almost all of the helpful information I needed through answering other people‚Äôs questions. So thank you so much for all the great advice!!    Including our travel days we were gone May 29-June 6. We had 6 full days/6 nights in Sydney. My travel party included myself (45 year old mom) and two of my kids 17 year old daughter and 14 year old son. We are all in good shape and generally adventurous people. My kids are a little bit more chill than me preferring more downtime on vacation but I think we balance out well. I was not originally looking to come to Australia (at least not yet!) but I couldn‚Äôt pass up an amazing flight deal I got back in February. Lucky for her my daughter‚Äôs been dreaming of coming to Australia I just didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be able to come so soon. Spoiler alert‚Ä¶she can‚Äôt wait to come back!!    I‚Äôll put the rest in the next post‚Ä¶ ,Erin F,Sydney,"Frisco, Texas"

Hello. We are a couple in our late fifties and plan to spend 10 full days in Melbourne as a base after visiting Sydney. We will be staying in CBD.  Can you suggest  1. Best way to get to CBD Melbourne from the Tullamarine airport?  2. Cheapest mobile/data service providers  3. Places to visit - which we can do in a leisurely way nothing hectic  4. Are the Hop On Hop Off buses good? Is there more than one operator? If so which is the better one?  5. Any unmissable day trips that we should do? We would like to stay in Melbourne and do day trips to nearby places  6. Best and most reasonable shopping markets for souvenirs  7. Does it make sense to pre-book these experiences (day trips HoHo buses Opera etc or should we come there and buy?) ,Fortyexcel,Melbourne,"Goa, India"
My wife and I will be going to AO next year and it is our first time going there and I am excited they are starting as the first ever Sunday opening match so therefore we have an extra day since when we arrive in the morning we intended to relax but now we will go straight to the AO and make most of our trip      I have some questions and hope you can assist for our planning since it is our first ever AO seeing live    1) Could we possibly buy the ground pass on the day? I assume it will be not be sold out like RLA MCA John Caine etc?  2) I just missed out the AO happy hour a few days ago where it was starting from $29. If we are there during the AO period is there any chance that they will also discount for RLA MCA John Caine etc? If so I probably will leave it till then plus I don;t know what matches will be played until a couple of days prior anyways  3) If we buy on either MCA Join Caine RLA matches do I understand that it is ONLY for that arena and not for other courts? Or it includes other courts (and therefore I do not really need to get the ground pass?)  4) Given we don;t know what matches will be played can we choose to upgrade 1-2 days prior once the matches/players schedules are released?  5) As for ground pass do they have any practice match court that we can also see?  6) Like said as it is our first time going there watching live should we watch any courts for ground pass from court 4 to 17 etc do we need to line up early at the start of the match? Or usually there will be seats/stand available especially plenty of action and plenty of courts to watch in the first few days/first few rounds and we can enter/leave anytime we want?  7) Our domestic flight back home is around 9pm so what is the latest time we have to leave from AO provided we want to make it to the most of the day. 5pm? 6pm? We intend to take by public transport    Thank you in advance ,Mike,Melbourne,"Sydney, Australia"

Anything I should add/skip?  2. I am confused if I should do Barossa valley/Adelaide hills in Adelaide and reduce a day from Sydney. Or add Hunter valley in Sydney.

Latitude have increased security recently so that online purchases require an additional security code via Mastercard. But that code can only be sent to an Australian mobile number. There is no in-app authentication option.    So unless you pay for international roaming fees there is no way to use the card online while overseas. This is 2023; a large proportion of purchasing activity takes place online. While overseas I could not link the card to a taxi app buy show tickets pay for tours...    This after their support first told me that there should be an alternative authentication option then told me that I would be able to change the registered number to my in-country number as a last resort (which takes 24 hours) neither of which are true. Their last risible suggestion after lodging a complaint was to have the codes sent to a friend or family member in Australia. So their best idea is to actually compromise my card's security further by sending the code to a third party (which is probably contrary to the T&Cs) than having no code at all! Never mind expecting that person to be on call 24/7 to service my account regardless of the time difference.    The app and website also have no secure mail option so you have to phone them (even from overseas) to deal with any issues and jump through the authentication hoops. I have not yet across more than half a dozen calls spoken with a support person with good English. ,AL,,

The location is extremely important. Where would you suggest? We understand that it‚Äôs not inexpensive. Thanks! ,Ellen L,Sydney,Royersford...
Wife and I will be visiting NSW Australia for 3 weeks starting 30-Oct. We land in Sydney and rent a car stay in Sydney for the first 4 nights. To acclimate and visit attractions such as maybe The Australian Museum Sydney Wildlife World Powerhouse Museum Luna Park Taronga Zoo Royal Botanic Garden etc... Then we drive to Old Bar to visit friends for 3 nights. Not sure what activities to do in that area. We will still have 2 weeks left to tour NSW and open to suggestions. Budget is preferably well under 100AUD / night for hotels. We like scenic areas mountains as well as beaches. Australia has many beautiful national parks maybe we can find nearby hotels where scenic hiking is not far off? But our rental car will have sealed road and snow line restrictions which may limit our options. We also like interesting places such as museums gardens etc. Maybe Puffing Billy (train)? Considering maybe visiting Nimben for a day or night though not sure what activities we can do there; though scenic(?) Nimbin Rocks might be a good excursion. We also like doing yoga so any interesting yoga studios or retreats could be an option. We end up with 1 (or more) nights in Sydney again before flying onward to Singapore. Any / all suggestions / comments welcome :-) ,JoeBo_2000,New South Wales,Los Angeles...
Hi  We arrive into Sydney on 26th December I assume UBERs will be on surge pricing on this date?  Does anyone know roughly what the cost would be? We are staying at Ibis Styles Sydney Central. ,Rubber_Duckie89,Sydney,"Godalming, United..."

Friends of mine are staying in Brisbane on NYE. They are looking at hotels in the CBD with a view to having the easiest/shortest walking access to Southbank. Presumably to enjoy the fireworks at 8.30pm. They will have a child with them. Where are the best pedestrian access points to Southbank from the other side of the river? Many Thanks :) ,Beach8um,Brisbane,Dingo Beach...
Hello    We were planning to wine taste in Yarra Valley in January however we would like to ship wine back to the USA rather than continue to travel with it. Are there postal options for this? If so can you recommend a company?    Also we would like recommendations for wineries to visit ,n d,Melbourne,"Folsom, California"
FYI BE FOR-WARNED Uber‚Äôs quoted rate from Sydney Domestic Airport into the CBD is NOT reliable. I was quoted an upfront price of $37.82 but was charged $51.82 for alleged tolls however the Uber app chose the route the driver took so it should have known the correct cost or at a minimum warned of the potential increases at the time of booking. This is my LAST TIME using Uber in Australia. If their pricing is not reliable then they can‚Äôt be trusted. ,Brian S,Sydney,"Arlington, Virginia"
We are going to spend 10 nights in February  2023 in Blue Mountains. Leaving and returning to Sydney.    Wife uses a mobility scooter that comes apart and stores in a regular sized trunk. (Boot?)    Plan on renting car in Sydney. What is best place to rent a car to avoid city traffic on way out?    Could do train trip and rent a car there. Mobility scooter and luggage would require a bit of time/effort.    Could stay in one spot or move a bit. Could drive out of area if nice spots would require. Could do loop back to Sydney.      Primary objective is to see Wildlife. What kind and best places?        First stop is Katoomba. After that?    Thanks. ,Dennis L,Blue Mountains,St. Augustine...

Come on Adelaide Airport you need to do better. We were in Adelaide last week end and on the way homeon Monday morning I was hoping for a bite of breakfast. I am Coeliac and used to really limited choices and I have really low expections but you guys can do better than this. I scanned the entire food court a couple of places offer eggs and bacon mostly with the prefix: we can't guarantee and not responsible... seriously people you can do better than that. It is not that difficult... I don't want a crappy slice of plastic wrapped days old banana bread. Maybe a sml bowl of gf granola some fruit a gf toasty( yep gf bread is a thing) I don't mind being slugged with exorbinant prices either we all used to that in airports. Take a leaf out of Earls in Tullamarine... if they can do it at least one of the sandwich bars at Adel airport can. ,Lee M,Adelaide,Carlton

Hi guys I'm arriving in Perth at the start of January and I will be doing some backpacking.  I will be in western Australia for 2-3 months before going over to the east coast.  I had originally planned to travel north of Perth and spend most of my time around Exmouth coral bay etc but after seeing how hot it can be during January/February I'm considering going south of Perth and going along the south coast.  Which route is best for a solo backpacker? Is north or south of Perth easier to get jobs accommodation more to see?  I'm not a big city guy I want to explore Perth but I'm more interested in natural Beauty nice beaches and friendly towns.  Can anyone advise me on what would be the best option for me and how long would I need to see around Perth before moving north/south  Thank you ,Nathan Hutchinson,Western Australia,
Hi everyone. I will be travelling to Perth in early May next year. I have a rough itinerary in mind but would like to seek help to see if it is doable with a baby.

I‚Äôm going to Australia for the first time in Feb for an event (I‚Äôm based in HK). I‚Äôll be in Sydney for 6 nights and I‚Äôm taking my two kids aged 4&6 and my mother who is thankfully a seasoned traveler and fairly fit.    We‚Äôll do the Blue Mountains Taronga Manly etc but we‚Äôve deciding to extend our trip by a week. We‚Äôre looking at a few options we would like a cultural aspect/nature and perhaps beach. Most of all it has to be kiddy friendly which rules out all the exclusive lodges and islands I like!    Our decision is do we do a) 7 days and fly to North Island NZ and explore by camper or car. We can do the Coromandel catch up with family out there Hobbiton etc    Or b) stay in Australia so far we like the look of Daintree rainforest Lord Howe Island and Hayman island as a possibility. We don‚Äôt want to do another city!    Any experiences with the above destinations in Feb and activities that kids will like. I hear getting around Oz the flights can be patchy.    I‚Äôm useless at making decisions so any thoughts on this is appreciated! ,Katie M,,
Hi all  Have seen some posts already regarding the road trip from Melbourne to Mildura but they are a bit dated. We're from the UK and planning our trip in November. Is there any reason to be concerned about the isolation on this route? Will my better half be cursing if I persuade him to drive this far in one day? I would also like to stop off in Ballarat for a couple of hours before carrying on to Mildura so I'm guessing it could be early/late evening before we arrive. ,702Lazybee,Mildura,Peterborough...

Hi  I am planning a solo trip to Sydney.  1- Are documents under the Top questions about Sydney current?  2- Is the max adult fare of $15 per day (Sunday $2.50) or $60 per week (Mon-Sunday) still the cap?  3- In the Opal card document the section about the disadvantages of using an Opal card has the following clause:    Hi  I am planning a solo trip to Sydney.  1- Are documents under the Top questions about Sydney current?  2- Is the max adult fare of $15 per day (Sunday $2.50) or $60 per week (Mon-Sunday) still the cap?  3- In the Opal card document the section about the disadvantages of using an Opal card has the following clause:    Weekly benefits only follow a Monday-Sunday travel week meaning maximum fare for seven days encompassing a weekend could be somewhat higher than $60 for example if ferry or long distance train transport was used extensively. (In a contrived absolute worst case; $15 Thu-Sat $2.50 Sun $15 Mon-Wed or $92.50 total.)    If in a contrived absolute worst case one travel cost is $92.50 but the mandate on the weekly cap is $60 then the commuter will save $32.50. Why is this a disadvantage (am I missing something)?

Artiving by cruise ship in Penneshaw mid February and want to tour. Wife uses mobile scooter. Renting a car is easiest because It comes apart and I can easily load and unload. Most excursions dont have space for the scooter.    How feasible is it to hop off ship grab a rental and drive around the islland? Seeing wildlife is biggest objective.

Hello    Apologies if this is not the best thread; headed to Hawaii shortly and recently had some gallstones appear on a scan for an unrelated matter.    I‚Äôve never had any symptoms from the stones but the GP has referred me to a specialist just to get it checked out haven‚Äôt had the appointment yet.    My question is - in my travel policy I have declared the pre-existing condition however where it specifically asks ‚Äúare you awaiting any treatment for the condition‚Äù I have selected no. Is this correct?    Of course hoping a claim isn‚Äôt necessary but definitely don‚Äôt want to have a claim declined due to an error here. I am not awaiting any treatment rather an appt with a specialist for a condition that has been diagnosed and just come to light.    Is this considered ‚Äútreatment‚Äù ?    Appreciate any advice. I have contacted the insurer but they‚Äôre yet to get back to me.    Thanks ,Travel_Incredible,Brisbane,Gold Coast...
Is there an easy way to filter or tell if a serviced apartment has A/C in the bedrooms? I am shocked at how many expensive 4 and 5 star rated places in the Gold and Sunshine Coasts don't. Looking to book a holiday over summer and got caught out on this once before.    Short of CSI on the photos or directly contacting the provider there seems no way to tell if Air Conditioned means the whole apartment of just one room? In general the high rise Gold Coast place seem to be fully A/C but the rest is pot luck. ,Luke R,Queensland,"Singapore, Singapore"
We will be in port from 8-5pm on the 6th of December 2023 and have not arranged any excursion or guide.

Hi All - apologies for the rambling post    Myself and wife are travelling into Brisbane arriving morning 27th December and leave from Sydney on the evening of 17th Jan for part honeymoon and part scoping out QLD & NSW prior to a potential relocation in 2024.    I have bits of our trip that I am quite happy with but big gaps in the middle. Would you be able to advise of where and for how long I should fill the gaps?    2 nights - Brisbane - adjust to time zone and scope out Brisbane  Fly to Mackay/Proserpine - pick up hire car  5 nights - Airlie Beach* - New Years eve activities Whitsundays Great Barrier Reef    * It is my wife's 30th on New Years Day so wants to spend New Years Eve somewhere with a good nightlife to bring in the celebrations. Is Airlie Beach the best place to do this?    BIG GAP IN ITINERARY - where should we go between Airlie Beach and Hunter Valley?    2 - 3 nights - Hunter Valley - wine tasting etc  5 - 7 nights - Bondi Manly etc to scope out Sydney as most likely relocation    Apologies for the spattering of details if you need any more info about us to help with recommendations then that would be great.    Thanks in advance for your advice. ,Greg H,Brisbane,"Glasgow, United..."
Good day fellow travelers and travel experts. I posted once earlier asking for advice on where I should stay for 6 nights in Surfer's Paradise and thanks to some of the experts on this forum I was pointed to Broadbeach as a good option. After some initial research I agree that Broadbeach would be a better choice than Surfer's Paradise for me. If I stay there I think that Peppers at Broadbeach would suit me well.    But now I am reconsidering whether I should stay in another area. Hoping that someone will be able to assist and offer recommendations including tips on accommodation.    Some information about me that may assist in providing recommendations. I am a 55 years old + female who will be traveling solo to Brisbane (likely on April 8) after a 3 week work stint in Solomon Islands. Following my Solomon Islands work assignment I will be traveling home to Canada with the flight stopping in Brisbane. I thought that it would be a great opportunity to explore the area as I have never been to Australia before.    I am looking for a place not too far from Brisbane for 6 nights. I won't be renting a car so I will need to find some kind of ground transportation to whatever locale/lodging I decide upon. I am not sure where would be the best place to stay - Sunshine Coast Gold Coast or Brisbane proper. In terms of lodging I would prefer a hotel or resort that is in walking distance to nearby sites restaurants and activities (particularly important since I won't have a car). My accommodation budget is about $500 AUD/night. I also prefer low-rises and lower density areas but I think that most of the options on Broadbeach are high rises. That's okay it's not a deal-breaker.    Things I like to do: dine and sip on wine and cocktails at restaurants/cafes enjoy some beach time snorkel take in a cultural tour enjoy nature (I love being close to water). I'll probably be a tad tired after my work assignment so I would also like to take this time to replenish. I'm not sure if that gives you enough information to provide suggestions but any advice would be greatly appreciated.    Thank you in advance. ,Reau,Queensland,"Ottawa, Canada"

Hi    Trying to do our bucket list before retirement and have 3 weeks in November 2024 pencilled (from 17th).    Original plan was Sydney/Cairn/NZ and thought of incorporating a cruise from Sydney to Cairns etc but I think have now decided on doing it ourselves.    Was going to ask for your help to see if Sydney (5nights) Brisbane (4 nights) (visiting Noosa from here day trip) Surfers Paradise (5 nights) Cairns (5 nights) Sydney (2 nights) sounded an OK itinerary.    On checking my dates I think I have now encountered an hiccup that schoolies may have taken over Surfers Paradise on my dates.    Should I go back to the drawing board could you advise how best to utilise our 3 weeks. We like sight seeing but we‚Äôre also looking to have free days chilling but are really open to advice and suggestions.    We intend to fly in and out of Sydney (not open jaw) and prefer to stay where there is an Hilton - we have been saving points for this bucket list trip.    Many thanks in advance for your help. ,ChrisDoncasterUK,,Doncaster UK
Hello may i know if fishing is okay during summer? A friend went to melbourne before and he said there are so many mosquitoes/flies flying in front of his face.

I'm coming over from the UK next year for my sister's wedding. I'll be flying into Melbourne airport and my plan is to hire a car and drive up to Mildura - I know it's quite a long drive my sister drove us up there when I was over in 2017. I hate flying and will have had 25 hours on a plane the day before so thought hiring a car would be a good option. I'd also like to see the Sea Lake silo art and possibly stop in Bendigo on the way back which i won't be able to do if I fly.    My question is am I OK to use the .au version of rental company sites? The cost with Budget's .au site is far lower than with the UK site despite putting in that I'm hiring from the UK. I know it will include all the insurance I need (I'll be buying a stand alone excess policy as it's far cheaper than taking the rental companies CDW cover - I'm aware I'll have to cover the excess and claim it back in the event of an accident) but I'm just wondering if there's a catch with it being so much cheaper.    Thank you! ,cottyh,,"Liverpool, United..."

Hi! We want to travel along the West Coast of Australia by campervan next year. I have already travelled along the East Coast with a campervan years ago. It was just a very basic campervan with a bed a stove sink and fridge. So no bathroom. At the East Coast that was no problem as there were many public toilets and showers everywhere (especially at the beaches).  But how is the situation regarding public toilets and showers at the West Coast? I'm a little worried about the long distances and fewer towns there. Are there enough campgrounds along the way? Are they affordable? Or would you recommend hiring a more expensive campervan with a toilet and shower? ,Anna,,
Hi    I have 4 nights in Cairns/PD area in late November. Here is what I‚Äôm thinking:    Day 1: Reef Snorkeling Tour with ABC    Day 2: Daintree Rainforest (River Cruise) maybe Mossman    Day 3: Kuranda?    I have a few questions.    1. I‚Äôm planning on staying in Port Douglas. Should I rent a car?    2. Also for the rainforest is it better to book a full day tour or do it self guided?    3. Im a solo traveler and quite scared of going to a rainforest alone. I have a phobia of snakes and some reptiles like lizards. It‚Äôs simply the sight that can freak me out. Is this something I should avoid? I don‚Äôt mind seeing crocodiles on the river cruise weirdly. Same goes for Kuranda activities    4. Any other suggestions on what I could do in the area? ,Blaire P,,"Portland, Oregon"

Hi everyone this part of my journey will be a part of a larger Australia tour for 4 adults and a 2.5 year old toddler in late March / early April. I will be visiting Sydney Melbourne Cairns Uluru and Tasmania not in that order. I have just started planning the trip so I can move around stuff and I will have a larger advise request in the main Australia forum in a couple of days after I zero in on some rough itinerary to the best of my knowledge.    My specific question about Uluru is flights seem to be insanely expensive and not direct especially from Cairns which is what I had originally planned on doing but does not seem possible in late March. Am I missing something or are flights to Uluru really that expensive (600 - 800 AUD per person one way) Any suggestions on how to optimize this?

we are keen hikers and bikers. is this a good itinerary for late january early february.? i feel we need some 3 night stays so we can really explore and do some longer walks (we are happy to walk 20km a day - but not everyday).  Arrive Hobart Airport and pick up rental car  2 nights Tasman Peninsula - Stewarts Bay Lodge  - 2 nights Freycinet National Park Region - Swansea Beach Chalets  - 2 nights Cradle Mountain - Tiny Escapes Cradle Valley  2 nights Corinna Wilderness Village  - 2 nights Strahan Village Village Waterfront  - 2 nights Lake St Clair - Pumphouse  2 nights ibis Styles Hobart  Return rental car to Hobart Airport and depart Tasmania    We are kiwis and have a real concern with snakes and spiders - being keen hikers we enjoy the outdoors and usually only visit oz in winter - but this is a summer trip when snakes are most active. Seriously i dont want to see a snake - is it irrational?    Thank you for any help. ,nzp0ppy,Tasmania,Nelson-Tasman...

I applied for ETA and got rejected. I see that I checked off Yes for criminal conviction by mistake.  I already followed the rejection letter instructions and submitted further information for correction on their immi website. My question is whether I should apply for another ETA visa right away with the correct info checked off.    Travel date is March 31. And yes I am fully aware how idiotic I am.    I also thought of going to the consulate for help on Monday if it helps. I live in Hong Kong.    Any insight would be appreciated. ,Terence F,,"Coquitlam, Canada"
Hi there - we‚Äôre planning another visit to wonderful Oz in May/June 2025 and this region is the focus. We are in our 70s if fit for our ages so not into intense hiking kayaking etc. We‚Äôre also not great sailors as get seasick easily! We have done many International road tours and river/ocean cruises. That said have looked at smaller ship cruises and wondering how buffeted we might be in choppy waters or if maybe there are any coach tours or self drive trips as an alternative? Plan to stay at El Questro somehow too! Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated. Have been researching but feeling uncertain of best way forward.

Hello lovely TripAdvisor helpers  My husband and I and our two girls are traveling (quite last minute) to Sydney arriving morning of Dec. 25 and departing morning of January 9. We have 15 nights. We came to Australia for our honeymoon 21 years ago and spent six weeks exploring your incredible country. Sydney (stayed in both Sydney and Manly Beach) Hamilton Island (beach club - we didn't have kids yet) Port Douglas and GBR Uluru Melbourne and did the great ocean road by rental car Barossa valley. Not to be maudlin but for sake of being transparent and to mention possible mobility issues for my husband -  my husband has been diagnosed with a grade 4 glioblastoma brain tumor back in May (we are 51) and we are looking to do a bucket list trip with our 13 and 15 year old girls. He is hanging in and has been through chemo and radiation this summer but still has some balance issues etc. He's an amazing trooper and wants to show our girls our favorite country but we know it's been many years! Of course the girls want to see Koalas and Kangaroos and the beaches and I had hopes of Uluru etc. but the flight prices are a bit much and we don't have six weeks this time! I remember seeing wombats on HI roaming and held a koala at their zoo - are there still places where our girls can actually touch a tame koala etc. I'm the type that won't even let my kids swim with dolphins in Mexico etc. because I think the way they are caged and treated is abusive so I know this is a hot button topic but I'm wondering if it's considered inhumane to hold a koala in a zoo setting etc. We saw kangaroos I think at the Grant Burge winery in Barossa roaming free (we didn't get near them - only watched them) so am wondering if there are places still like that in the Sydney area or maybe somewhere else? I think the Great Barrier Reef would be an incredible experience for our girls even if my husband can't snorkel (fingers crossed he's normally a great ocean swimmer so depending on the seas and how he feels...) he is hoping for them to experience the reef. We have clearly waited too long to book but for obvious reasons we were waiting for an MRI to tell us he could travel so I have just confirmed flights today. I had hoped for Hamilton Island but reading reviews it doesn't seem to be what it was and may be quite busy and hard to get restaurant reservations etc at this late date. I did also check flights to Port Douglas and it may be an option. Long story short I am wondering if you think a week in Sydney and a week in Port Douglas? Or a 5 5 5 night situation with perhaps Whitsundays or another area I'm not aware of? Is there another Whitsunday Island that is less popular that we could try or might be a better choice? Essentially we like ocean swimming and the girls are strong swimmers we love nature and outdoor activities restaurants aren't as big of a deal (don't need fancy) just able to get a meal preferably with a glass of wine etc. for me but not fast food usually willing to get a rental car if that's a good idea he's even talking about trying harbour bridge but that scares me for him...bottom line Im sorry for being so vague but Im just starting (yes I know - good luck to me) and I'm drowning in memories of wanting to go everywhere. I've been reading forums for days and I'm wondering if Sydney (even if we have to stay slightly out) and Port Douglas would be a combo to balance big city and a smaller region or should I be just staying in Sydney and trying for day trips and perhaps a boat trip out to Whitsundays or maybe a few days out there...I am just trying to start with picking your genius brains. My kids are well-traveled and well-behaved (I know I'm their mother but we have dragged them around with us since they were babies and they've been major troopers and they are SO excited to come to Australia...üòÇüòá) - we've done Europe a few times Mexico Canada etc. (we live in California but I am Canadian they are all American) so can hang with whatever we throw at them but we are not on a huge budget either - we fly on miles and generally try to air bnb if possible but are also willing to consider resorts or hotels where needed...but I know we are in the crazy xmas season so thought I'd ask for advice and then will continue to ask questions I'm sure! Thank you for ANY advice in advance and please ask for clarification as I know I'm rambling on. Thank you and Sorry for the ambiguity! ,JennyNMountainView,,Mountain View...

Hi I have really appreciated all the help I have gotten so far from this forum in helping us decide on our high-level itinerary (for a vacation that was planned last minute). Looking for some recommendations for more of the individual components within the itinerary now.    As a recap we are a couple in our late 30s have no kids and live in the San Francisco Bay area. Here is our high-level itinerary:  Nov 19: We fly into Cairns around 5 pm. Hotel booked at Crystalbrook Flynn.  Nov 20: Snorkeling tour booked with Reef Magic.  Nov 21: Looking to do Wildlife Habitat Port Douglas + Kuranda (or may be Daintree).  Nov 22: We fly into Sydney around 11 am. We will plan to visit Opera House and Harbour Bridge -- photograph them from various angles :). Hotel booked at Four Seasons.  Nov 23: We will rent a car from Circular Quay and drive to Jervis Bay in morning. Hotel booked at Dolphin Shores.  Nov 24: We will drive over to Blue Mountains. Hotel booked at Fairmont Resort.  Nov 25: We will plan to visit Scenic World in the morning (we read on their website that skyway is closed for maintenance and reopens Nov 25th -- that's why doing it this morning). We will then drive back to Sydney. In Sydney we will plan to go to Bondi beach + may be walk over to Coogee beach.  Nov 26: We fly back home around 2 pm    Would appreciate advice and tips for:  (1) how to get from Cairns to Wildlife Habitat and Kuranda and what to do at Kuranda (we would like to experience the rainforest). And if by chance we decide to replace Kuranda with Daintree and rent a car would appreciate advice on what places to visit at Daintree.  (2) which route to take from Sydney to Jervis Bay + what to do on the way and after reaching there. What we already have in mind: Cave Beach to hopefully see some kangaroos + Hyams beach.  (3) which route to take from Jervis Bay to Blue Mountains + what to do on the way and after reaching there. What we already have in mind is of course Three Sisters from Echo Point. ,crazeecee,,"San Jose, California"

Hi All  We are travelling to Burnie in January on a cruise. We are taking my elderly mother-in-law with us who has some mobility problems. She had a walker and can only walk short distances.  Just wondering if there are any shops or market stalls on the dock at Burnie. Alternatively is there a return shuttle bus into town? The listed cruise tours appear to be quite long and probably involve more active participation.  Any help or suggestions would be most appreciated. Thank you. ,Travelbug1233,Burnie,Australia
We're from SEQ so we are already familiar with some of the safety precautions for beaches but FNQ beaches seem to have some additional requirements that we're not familiar with.    Swimming is fairly straightforward we'll only swim between the flags at patrolled beaches. We'll also only swim in stinger enclosures in the warmer months.    Walking is less straightforward and I can't seem to find a good answer. Obviously there are no jellyfish on land. However there can be crocs on land near water. The official website says to stay 5m away from water at all times be careful of your food while camping and camp 50m away from water etc.    We will probably just avoid hiking to remote rivers/creeks/waterholes. But what about walking on the beach?    Can we:  - Walk on non-patrolled beaches (not wading)?  - What about walking on the beach at dusk?  - Can we have a picnic at the beach?  - Can we set up our beach tent <50m from the water if we're not actually staying the night just taking a nap in the afternoon?    It's hard to imagine that locals don't do all of this - we actually visited Airlie once and walked along the main beach at night which we didn't realise was advised against. But there were a ton of locals doing the same thing. Of course just because people do it doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea...    What do you think? ,Elliannia,Townsville,
I have 9 nights in Aus and was thinking I could do either:    Day 1: Land in Sydney 4/5 hour buffer fly to Cairns  Day 2: Cairns/Kuranda  Day 3: PD  Day 4: PD  Day 5: Fly to SYD in evening  Day 6 - 10: SYD    or    SYD for 3 nights PD/Cairns for 4 nights then SYD for another 2 nights    Im leaning first option for less backtracking and second for more rest before PD/Cairns.    Any opinions/advice? I wouldn‚Äôt be driving the day of a long international flight ,Blaire P,,"Portland, Oregon"
Hi    I am planning a couple of road trips through Australia and will obviously find myself in cities at the start and end of trips. Absolutely prefer nature and tranquillity but cities can be great for there atmosphere parks and food.    I will find myself in the following cities.    Sydney  Melbourne  Adelaide  Perth    I have a couple of months in Australia. Fundamentally my questions are:    1. Which of the cities are most worth visiting?  2. How much time should I spend in each?  3. Am I better allocating more time away from cities? e.g Great Ocean Road Margaret river Exmouth and other places I plan to visit on various road trips.

I‚Äôm planning late since I learned last minute about this trip (it‚Äôs a long story). I was going to combine Sydney and one other destination.    I was debating either adding Melbourne and doing the Great Ocean Road or going somewhere like the Whitsundays or Cairns/Port Douglas and go snorkeling.    Any advice for which to choose?

Hi  We are planning a visit to Australia around Mid December for 2 weeks. We like nature animals and sightseeing. Below is the tentative itinerary and looking for advise on whether this is doable. Some of the top interests are Snorkeling in great barrier reaf animals (see kangaroo pet koala) visit a couple of great beaches and a coastal drive.    Day 1 - land in sydney  day 2 - Sydney city sightseeing Bondee beach  day 3 - Blue mountain  day 45- sydney to gold coast drive  day 6 - gold coast  day 7- fly to cairns  day 8- snorkel in GBR  day 9 - daintree  day 10- fly to melbourne melbourne city sightseeing  day 11 12- Great ocean drive  day 13 - Philip island - penguin parade  day 14 - fly back    The challenge is that we have just 11 days - and the itinerary feels too packed. so trying to cut down some of these.  I see we have 2 different drives here - Sydney to gold coast as well as Great ocean drive. Which one is more scenic if I have pick between the two? We will rent a car and drive ourselves instead of taking a tour bus as we enjoy driving and seeing things at our own pace..    We will be flying out to Auckland NZ after this. Extending the number of days is tough due to work constraints. Have not booked the ticket yet. so can switch the route if we should rather start from Melbourne.

Hello all  First of all Big thanks to everyone who have been helping me with all my planning so far.  Now trying to decide on which tour to take from Cairns.    From the reviews I see here both Seastar and Magic reef seem to be the top ones. We are a family of 3 - we are just beginner level swimmers and have done snorkeling before. We are looking for a tour where someone will keep an eye on us - not necessarily be with us all the time. Which one should we choose? Are there any other tours that we should look into as well?    I looked into the magic reef website - it has a guided snorkeling activity - that seems to be extra. Does the basic cost also include snorkeling? Is it just off the pontoon? If so are there people keeping an eye on you?      Thanks again for your help. ,HelloWorldTraveler1,Cairns,San Francisco...

Curious as to any thoughts on NYE activities. If we choose to be in the city for New Years Eve and not stay home and watch things on TV what‚Äôs the best way to choose a venue? We are going to brace the crowds for this once in a lifetime activity for us. Ive been scouring a bunch of sites for different activities and found several that sound interesting but never having been for NYE wanted some advice on options:    - Luna Park: sounds like a fun way to spend an evening with the fireworks as a backdrop but I‚Äôve read a couple of opinions that said it‚Äôs fun but being so close to the bridge gives you an obstructed view and not a view of the whole area.  - Taronga Zoo: sounds like another fun but from what I remember the zoo is pretty far off into the distance from Sydney Harbor and seeing fireworks from afar.  - Museum: there is a museum that was hosting a party and it had a balcony overlooking the bridge and opera house. It was a little pricey but would be different. The plus was that you can go inside if it was a little cooler at night. The con was it was pricey and you have to dress up but it seemed like a decent option nonetheless.  - Cruises: found a few movies that still had tickets left. Some had seats to reserve others were standing room free access to the boat etc. The one con was potentially that if it got to cool at night it might be a little cold but not sure if it got that cool enough to worry about considering it‚Äôs the summer. And weather dependent.    A cruise seems like the best option to see the most views. Are there any pros and cons to doing a cruise? Anything I should take into consideration when choosing a company to go with?    Thank you so much for your help. ,CSquaredC2,Sydney,San Francisco...

We have found cheap flights to Melbourne over Christmas and New Year and want to use the opportunity to visit close friends in Melbourne. Our plan would be to spend a week with them in Melbourne and then take a one week roadtrip around Victoria to visit nature and national parks.    Because we are tent camping with our two kids 3&7 years to help keep costs down and because we love the outdoors we want to choose two bases to stay with our tent and do day trips from.    So I'm looking for suggestions we would love one to be coastal somewhere with easy access to rock pools and if possible snorkeling. The second would be an inland area either jungle or mountains. Any suggestions of best places to visit would be appreciated we are also mindful that it is peak holiday season. ,clare c,Victoria,
Hi  I am traveling to Cairns with my partner for the first time. We are looking to book a GBR cruise for introductory scuba and snorkeling.

We r going to Sydney in Dec for the first time. Total of 10 days including flight time. Prefer not to drive within city .  Chatgpt gave me below itinerary. Does it make sense?  Day 1: Arrive in Sydney and check in to your hotel. You can choose from a variety of family-friendly hotels in Sydney such as the Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel Sydney[^10^] or the Four Seasons Hotel Sydney‚Åπ both located in the CBD and close to many attractions. You can use the Opal card or contactless payment to travel on public transport in Sydney including trains buses ferries and light rail. After settling in you can explore the nearby area and enjoy a dinner at one of the many restaurants in the city.    Day 2: Visit the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge two of the most iconic landmarks in Sydney. You can take a guided tour of the Opera House and learn about its history and architecture or watch a performance if you book in advance.

Hi  I plan to visit Australia 1st time with my wife in April 2024. We have 3 weeks available and will be traveling from Europe with Singapore stopover for 3 days. Then we want to fly to Sydney for 4 days some days for Hunetr Valley other areas etc. From Sydney we want to fly to Uluru for 2 days and then most probably fly to Cairns to see GBR and other places (3 or 4 days) . From Cairns back to Sydney and then back home. So in total including demestic flights we will have around 14 days in Eastern Australia. As this will be Autumn (April) I am not sure if this is a good travel plan talking weather and no beach swimming due to stingers. My plan is not fixed yet and I am also thinking of adding a short Whitsundays visit or any other places...... The thing is we want to have it rather relaxed holiday and not kill ourselves rushing from A to B. Appreciate any advice. best regards ! ,MN C,,"Gdansk, Poland"
I‚Äôm looking or recommendations for a good toy store or toy department in a department store. Preferably in the CBD but I can travel.    I‚Äôm looking for some kind of wooden puzzle game for an almost 2 year old girl with Australian native anaimals. I have been instructed by her that I have to bring her back a snake croc roo and koala. I have the snake already a large stuffed fluffy one and I won‚Äôt have room for more stuffed toys. Plus she‚Äôs in hospital and not allowed loads of big things in her room. She is an energetic and active wee soul and likes playing with puzzles She also loves musical toys too.    Any suggestions on where to try would be greatly appreciated. ,AmoMondo,Sydney,"Edinburgh, United..."
We are driving our 8 mtr motorhome from Brisbane to Tasmania and have booked to travel on the overnight ferry. We have time to potter around and sight-see but have no itinerary as yet. Advice was suggested in going west to east due to the weather although we do have a diesel heater so can be toasty warm regardless. Should we perhaps drive to Cradle Mountain and explore there first before heading west? We are expecting to cover most of the roads suitable for campers during our trip and thought about visiting Bruny Island for a few days. Please suggest other must see places that might not be as well known. We are going to buy a National Park Pass. Thanks (Sorry 2024) ,Cosmopolitan562518,Tasmania,
I am going to Sydney in Feb for a work event. My wife is coming along and we'll spend an additional week for travel and sightseeing. I've been to Sydney 3 times and feel confident enough on planning things for my wife to do during my work event and for us to do together when time allows.    We're mostly concerned about the rest of the trip. Want to balance having a full trip with not trying to do too much. We're not super outdoorsy not big shoppers or into arts/museums etc. We don't dive but have done some light snorkeling in the past. She does like relaxing on a good beach and wants to see koala's kangaroos etc. Not into nightlife etc. Just want to do a bit of sightseeing mixed with some relaxation. Planning to fly to 1-3 domestic destinations with Sydney being home base for international flights but there may be an option to fly back to LAX from Brisbane or Melbourne instead if its best for itinerary.    Also very curious about weather and how it would affect our itinerary.    Here is the start of our itinerary:    First week:  Mon-Fri: Work event  Sat: Blue Mountain tour/excursion    Second week options (Sun - Fri fly out on Sat):  Melbourne?  Brisbane/Gold Coast?  Whitsundays?  Cairns?  Great Barrier Reef?  Kangaroo Island  Some sort of wildlife preserve somewhere- Koala's Kangaroos etc. ,realslfan,,Salt Lake

My wife daughter and myself have been visiting the Gold Coast every couple of years for the past 8 years. We stay at Nobbys beach and really appreciate being close enough to get to all the tourist spots easily if we want to but also being far enough away that we can enjoy the serenity and the amenities that the area has.  In an effort to not turn into our respect parents and go to the same place for holidays until our dying days I was wondering if any Sunshine Coast local experts knew of a similar area up that way where you had the best of both worlds? Beach food drink but not necessarily the busyness of being in the heart of Noosa.    Thanks  Matt ,Matt C,Sunshine Coast,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hi!  A bit of a dumb question perhaps but how do I go watch a horse race? I'm a horsey person but I've never seen a race as there's only harness tracks where I'm from. It's on my bucket list to go to the gallops once.  There's a race on in Scone on 20 November that I'd like to go to as I'll be in the vicinity but I'm not sure how. There's very little info available on the website. Do I have to get a ticket? Do I have to bet? Is there a dress code (I'm female)? Do I have to get a silly hat with an ostrich feather or something in it that you see in pictures from races?  Any help much appreciated! ,Jessy,,Finland
Hubby and I would like a day visit to the Blue Mountains. We are debating if we should book 1/ a tour with Diamond Tours/small group to include syd to blue mountains return trip includes Three Sisters and Scenic World package (cable car skyway and railway) and a couple of other stops inclusive of Syd Zoo visit on return trip. Cost AUD $250 p.p. We are really only interested in Scenic World Package Three Sisters and a few walks and scenery. 2/ We thought possibly to catch the train to the Blue Mountains from Central Station in Sydney return (enjoy the train ride) and then book the Hop on Hop off bus - Blue Mountains Explorer as this seems to stop at many points of interest and cost about half the price per person. I welcome feedback if anyone have used these 2 options. Thank you ,TrevStar,Sydney,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hello  We need to be at a military reunion in Tweed heads which will take up 4 days and I have booked accomodation there.  We check out on a Monday and will go to Brisbane for maybe 3 days. Cant afford any more time unfortunately but haven't been there for 45 years.  I'm searching on here for current info on hotels but not finding any.  Theres 3 of us so we would like either a hotel with 2 beds or an apartment with 2 bedrooms.  Would look at 2 hotel rooms too if not overly expensive.  A pool would be nice.  Central so that we could see as much as we can in that time frame.  Perhaps everyone's favourite hotel would be helpful.  Thank you. ,WSAH,Brisbane,"Perth, Australia"

Anyone ever taken Murray bus from Sdyney to Canberra? Looks like the only way to get the ticket from the Sydney airport is to purchase it online. I am flying in and want to take the bus straight to Canberra and I am more concerned about if any flight delays from the USA. So would I have any issues to buy ticket when I land using the Sydney airport wifi or there's a risk of running out of seats? The day I want is Sunday morning in January. ,travelbie,Sydney,New Orleans...

Hello!    I'm visiting from the US and wondering is it usually better to sit on the left side or right side of the plane for views of Sydney? I read that for Sydney most people say right if taking off from SYD north runway?    Or do you not see anything most of the time? I usually prefer to sit on the left side wondering if the view would be worth going behind my OCD to sit on the right side of the plane    Plane will take off at 12 pm on the 27th of November ,Tom T,,Silverdale...
Hi  We are planning a 2 weeks trip to Australia in December and want to do Great Barrier reef. we will be doing 4 days in Sydney and 4 days around Melbourne. Trying to decide on where to do GBR from.

this is for GBR specifically but also daintree/cape tribulation.    It seems like there are a lot of different reef options for GBR and it is overwhelming. Are the reefs more similar than different? I can't tell how much thought I should put into that aspect or if tours are more similar than different and I should just pick a well reviewed one or if I should really research them since they have the potential to be different.    From another thread i was advised to avoid green island and go further out but that's really the only tip I took.    Same for daintree/cape tribulation. Are various tours mostly similar similar and I should focus on price and reviews or can they be very different? Is there a particular site(s) to visit I should make sure the tour goes to?    I was just in Melbourne and there and went on a Great Ocean Road tour and Phillips Island tour and there all the tours do pretty much the exact same thing. I can't tell if GBR and daintree are similar or if there require more in depth research.    Any advice to please steer me in the right direction and any recommendations on sites and tours would be great as well. Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time! ,Michael R,Cairns,

Hi there üëã  Travel dates 11th March to 19th March  We are planning a campervan trip to depart and finish in Melbourne for the above dates.

( are we missing something if we don't drop back down to the coastal road and go from there? Mount Gambia?)  We then plan to take an inland route back from Adelaide to Melbourne via Barossa Valley Renmark Mildura. Can anyone recommend or advise on this route. Is it worth the travel time?!

Hello    I can't seem to find this info anywhere and I haven't been able to get through to the customer services yet.    The website says that the max size checked in bag should be 140cm. Mine will definitely be over this as I will be arriving from an international flight before taking a few domestic flights during my stay. But there are no price guidelines about how much an oversized bag fee might be. Does anyone know this? Or if Virgin Australia are slightly lenient with luggage bags?

Hope you can help.  I've visited Australia with my husband over a dozen times and been lucky enough to visit all the major cities enjoy the GBR and Hamilton Island visit the Daintree Rainforest Exmouth Lord Howe Canberra Adelaide and lived in Sydney on a working holiday visa once.  Sydney in particular will always have a special place in my heart but I haven't ventured far in NSW beyond the Blue Mountains and Chatswood!    This time we would be travelling in May with our 5 year old (first time for him) and we have 2.5-3 weeks allocated.    As we would be coming from London (the flight will be A LOT for my son as it is) I wanted to limit too many additional flights and thought we would prioritise Sydney for the first 10 nights (taking the ferries to Manly/Mosman public transport to Palm Beach Taronga zoo Botanic gardens and venture to neighbourhoods including Glebe/Newtown/Paddington/Surrey Hills/playgrounds parks...) plus fit in a day of rest with no plans.    I then thought we could fly to Uluru for 4 nights (long enough?) where we have some guided excursions planned then back to Sydney for the last 3 nights which would coincide with the start of the Vivid Light show. before returning to London.  I haven't been in Sydney for Vivid before and am curious.  We do love cities but thought Uluru would make a nice contrast.  Is Vivid worth sticking around for?  My other thoughts would be to spend a few fewer nights in Sydney and take the train to Newcastle for 2 nights - to visit the beaches there and see somewhere new without getting on another plane. Or hiring a car and doing a side trip to Canberra for a few days?  Uluru has always been on my bucket list so I would like to keep that but I'm unsure if we might be planning too much time in Sydney.  We do enjoy slowing down and not packing in too much but wondering if it might start to feel a bit same-y after a week? We are not sunbathers but our child would enjoy spending time at the beach nonetheless without needing to swim. I know May will probably be in the low 20's weather wise and not necessarily beach weather.  Any suggestions for side trips from Sydney that could work (our child loves taking the train)- either using public transport or hiring a car would be appreciated.  Would you recommend Newcastle or perhaps a few days on the northern beaches at this time of year? If we can get away with not hiring a car even better.  And is the Vivid light show worth staying for for the first few nights?  Any advice would be appreciated around this itinerary.  Thanks so much! ,Seya,Sydney,"London, United..."

Hello everyone! I have a couple of questions on hikes at cradle mountain and freycinet. Thanks in advance for any advice!    I'm in a tour group and will have four hours to do a hike at cradle mountain. Would I be able to combine aspects of dove lake circuit and marion's lookout walk as shown on this site?  https://allthegearbutnoidea.blogspot.com/2022/08/marions-lookout-dove-lake-cradle.html  It seems like dove lake circuit and marion's lookout individually are 3 hours and 2 hours respectively so i'd like to combine parts of them to fill out the time.    For freycinet I'm leaning wineglass bay lookout track and mt amos. Please let me know if I shoudl consider something else.    Thanks again! ,Michael R,Tasmania,

Traveling to Australia to visit family for the first time since Covid next month and remembering the instantaneous nature of the e-visa last time we have not yet applied. üòµ‚Äçüí´  My understanding coming from the States is that we can apply for the eTA via the recommended app rather than the Immi website (as you would for the 600). Assuming this is correct I see there is a question about an alias or having used another name. When I changed my last name after marriage I also dropped my first name as it was never used. If I answer yes to another name for this reason am I likely to be flagged and not approved? It would be dishonest to say I haven‚Äôt had any alternate names ever unless they mean ones that I‚Äôm currently using (like still using two different names for some reason). For extra fun my last name is now hyphenated and we all know computer systems hate that.    Would love a little clarity/reassurance. We are already in a pinch due to having to expedite kids‚Äô passport renewals so I‚Äôm overly anxious about things going wrong before we even get to leave. Thanks! ,Alexis T,,"Portland, Oregon"
Hi there üëã I would like to stay right ON the Darling Harbour for a couple of nights with my 2 kids... We want to be right there in the thick of it super close to everything with a view of the Harbour.

70 y/o fit experienced snorkelers looking for 3 day liveaboard to GBR -- We used to dive but now prefer snorkeling -- Websites list snorkeling but our experience elsewhere is boats may only go to deep dive sites and snorkelers can go along rather than sites that may be good for both diving and snorkeling -- Any recent experience? Beginning to plan trip Nov to February 23/24. We have no problem with minimalist accommodations and don't need gourmet meals but low cost not as important as the experience. We don't need/want a guide in the water and don't mind being triple the average age if the others don't.  Thanks for any advice. ,Sholdr,Cairns,Dallas
My partner is lucky enough to have been successful at being granted both the 309 and 100 Permanent Residency Visas. The final date of initial entry however is at an inconvenient time.  We are 33 hrs flights away with two kids so popping in and out earlier is difficult.  There is the provision to apply for a deferral late inthe period. We would however be unwise to wait till that opportunity to find out iwhether it would work to seek a deferral.

We just booked a last-minute trip to Australia! Yay!    We are a couple in our late 30s have no kids and live in the san francisco bay area. We are flying into Melbourne on Nov 19 and flying out of Sydney on Nov 26 (I know a little short but we will plan to come back again!).    We would love to see kangaroos koalas and penguins in natural settings (no zoos or enclosures). Our goal is to get more unique experiences that can't be had in California/US.    This is what we are thinking. Would love any advice especially since we have to essentially finalize everything in the next few days.    Nov 19 -- Fly into Melbourne morning relax and maybe do some sightseeing (any suggestions?)  Nov 20 -- Day trip to Philip Island  Nov 21 -- Fly to Adelaide and then ferry to Kangaroo Island (or fly to Kangaroo Island?)  Nov 22 -- Kangaroo Island  Nov 23 -- Kangaroo Island (worth spending two days here or put this day elsewhere?)  Nov 24 -- Fly to Sydney  Nov 25 -- See Sydney Opera House + Harbour Bridge + walk between Bondi and Coogee Beach  Nov 26 -- Fly out in the afternoon ,crazeecee,,"San Jose, California"

Hello    I have 10 days Dec 11 - 21st off which I want to take vacation and there are 2 places on my bucket list: Australia and Taiwan/HK.    I would have 8 nights in total in Australia. 9 nights in Taiwan/HK due to the travel times.    I booked my plane ticket to Australia but can change it without any fees for another destination. Been having last minute reservations and debating changing my trip to do Taiwan/HK instead.    Ive been trying to plan and I realized I would need way more time in Aus. And also now I‚Äôm thinking I would find Taiwan/HK mix more enjoyable.    These are two sample itineraries I came up with for Australia:    - 4 nights Sydney  - 4 nights Melbourne    When I travel I really enjoy cities food and nature (although the nature part scares me a little about Australia since I don‚Äôt like snakes/lizards same as the other guy posted). For Australia the main draw for me were the cities and also the beautiful beaches. However I realized that the Whitsundays it‚Äôs less ideal to swim this time of the year.    The other option I was considering was Taipei and Hong Kong as a trip. However I did a Tokyo trip this year and feel Taipei would just feel like a smaller Tokyo. But maybe that‚Äôs not a bad thing. I do love skylines though and Hong Kong looked amazing.    I guess lately I‚Äôm having last minute ‚Äúbuyer‚Äôs remorse‚Äù about choosing Australia over Taiwan/HK trip. But I feel anything I choose I‚Äôll have regret for not choosing the other place. I also have more time in the spring as well if I wanted to dedicate it to a bigger trip so I could either do Australia rn or have 2 weeks to do HK + Taiwan + another city or vice versa.    Basically could just use advice if I‚Äôm making the right decision or should change my plans and go to Aus another time? ,Tom T,,Silverdale...

I've spent time reading the excellent advice on this perennial topic. I'm hoping some will indulge me revisiting it here.    My wife and I live in NYC and we will be visiting Australia for 7 weeks: Dec 22 2023 to February 11 2024. Neither of us have been before.    We're spending the first 10 days in Sydney (Manly specifically) and the final 3.5 weeks in Melbourne because (1) we want to see some Australian Open matches and (2) my wife will work at Melbourne University for 2 weeks.    We will use the 10 days in between to drive from Sydney to Melbourne. We like to soak up local culture to the extent we can swimming and reading at a beach kayak and boat tours wildlife and we are very happy walking around and getting coffee and snacks. We are very easy to entertain. Also we aren't nightlife people.    Long wind-up but this is my itinerary:  Two nights in Jervis Bay  Two nights in Canberra  One night in Bega (there's a nice little homestead farm where you can rent a room)  One night in Narooma or Eden or Marimbula  Two nights in Mallacoota from which we'd additionally explore Croajingolong  Two nights somewhere in the area of Wilsons Promontory    Aussies: does this look like a decent framework for you? Any advice?  I am usually more interested in leaving flexibility but as this will be holiday season I feel the need to get my overnight bookings in place.    Thanks in advance for any feedback and thanks for all of the preceding dialogue I've benefited from on this forum. ,ATXtoNYC,New South Wales,"New York City, New..."

Hello fellow travelers and Aussie locals    First of all congrats on the recent win in the cricket match in world cup wow what a nail biter!    I'm embarking on a solo journey to Australia and have outlined an itinerary that I'm excited about but I'm seeking your local expertise to refine my plans. I generally like nature and I like to travel rather slowly if I can help it.    Here's a snapshot of my trip:  Brisbane (December 6-10):  Arrival: 4:55 PM staying at Selina Brisbane.  Planned activities: Kundalini yoga class leisure exploration of Brisbane's attractions.  Considering day trips to Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast.  Departing for Cairns at 9 PM on December 10th.    Cairns & Great Barrier Reef (December 10-15):  Arriving in Cairns at 11 PM.  Aiming for 3-4 days dedicated to the Great Barrier Reef exploring Cairns and potential day trips to nearby attractions.    Tasmania (December 15-28):  Starting in Hobart renting a carvisiting Salamanca Market.  Staying at Belmont Homestead for 3 nights from December 17th.  One night in Launceston followed by 5 nights in Cradle Mountain.  Extra days with no fixed plans; considering visiting Russell falls.    Sydney (December 29 - January 3):  Planning to see the New Year's Eve fireworks.  Departure from Sydney on January 3rd.    With this in mind I have a few specific queries:    Brisbane: Since I have not booked a car what are some must-do activities within Brisbane that are accessible by public transport? Is the Gold Coast feasible as a day trip without a car and how would I get there?    Cairns: I have a 4-night stay in Cairns and would love to dive in the Great Barrier Reef. Can anyone suggest tour companies that are welcoming to solo divers?    Cradle Mountain: In Tasmania I'm looking forward to exploring Cradle Mountain and Freycinet National Park. Are there any particular hikes or secluded spots that come highly recommended for someone seeking solitude and natural beauty?    I'm all ears for any tips hidden gems and must-sees that could make this solo trip an unforgettable experience. Thank you for your time and assistance! ,minkathebest,,San Francisco...

Now I have an extra 5 days before I want to be back in Perth.. one of those days could be a plane flight back from Esperance to Perth leaving the car in Esperance if need be.  Would I have enough time to get to Esperance and have a look around Lucky bay and Hellfire bay or are there lots more places I am missing around the South West area.

    Hi all    We will be flying out 2weeks fr now to Tasmania and then Melbourne. All hyped up and doing last min checks now.    It has been a long time since I was last there and I am sure payment form has evolved. SG is slowly moving towards being cashless w some places not taking cash payment at all.    Is it the same in Melbourne and Tasmania? Or are some places still accepting cash only? R there surcharges for using credit card?

Hi    I am approaching the departure day and have started reviewing my itinerary. On one of the evenings I am supposed to take a ferry ride from Circular Bay near Opera House to Watson Bay but I left out a comment (inadvertently of course) about Why in the evening?

Hi all  We will fly into Sydney on Good Friday 29th March 2024 (yep not a good day for travelling as services will be limited) and we take a cruise to Hobart the next day on 30th March. I haven't been to Sydney for many years so really could use some suggestions for the one nights accommodation. Due to it being Easter weekend I don't know whether to stay nearer the port ready for the Sat or where else would be a good move. I would really appreciate some input on this one  Cheers ,sonandsal,Sydney,"Yokine, Australia"

Hello. We are a couple in our late fifties and plan to spend 8-9 full days in Sydney as a base before moving on to Melbourne. We will be staying in CBD.  Can you suggest  1. Best way to get to CBD Sydney from the international airport?  2. Cheapest mobile/data service providers  3. Places to visit - which we can do in a leisurely way nothing hectic  4. Are the Hop On Hop Off buses good? Is there more than one operator? If so which is the better one?  5. Any unmissable day trips that we should do?  6. Best and most reasonable shopping markets for souvenirs  7. Does it make sense to pre-book these experiences (day trips HoHo buses Opera etc or should we come there and buy?)    Thank you for your help. ,Fortyexcel,Sydney,"Goa, India"

first i know they are so different you can't compare them and chalk and cheese and all that but my question is which people consider more unique to australia. This is my first time in the country and i may not return for years and years so i want to see something that i am less likely to see elsewhere. For that reason I'm currently leaning towards Ballarat since it has cultural significance to Melbourne's history but I wanted to see what knowledgeable people here think. I'm already visiting great ocean road grampians and Philips island. I considered wilsons promontory at first but i took that out since while pretty from pictures it looks like you can visit something similar elsewhere.    Another consideration is that if I go to yarra valley i will take an organized trip. If I go to Ballarat I will just take the train from Southern cross. If I do that I think I'll only have time for sovereign hill since wildlife park and lake wendouree seem far for someone without a car. If that is accurate is it still worth the trip? ,Michael R,Melbourne,

Hi All    Air India Just announced Direct flight to Melbourne from Mumbai.. Went ahead and booked tickets as were available at quite reasonable rates for December month without thinking much. Been just out of my Cancer treatment with Bone Marrow transplant hence thought family needed some cheering up. We also have valid 3 year Australian visa so decided to plunge üòå.. Have been to Australia earlier few times but never for such a short period . Need help to plan this effectively as under.    17th Dec We land around 6pm Melbourne after 12hr direct flight from Mumbai.    17-18Dec Night in Melbourne just relex.  19th 24th Would like to drive to Adelaide with 1 stop over and back to Great Ocean road driving straight on way back.  24th Dec -27th Either at Johanna or some place near 12 Apostles .  27th - 31st Melbourne flight is at 8pm on 31st so will hv almost full day.    I seek help to plan between 19th to 24th to Adelaide and back plus before we hit Johanna if can suggest any other place for a day before we hit Melbourne would be great ful. We can compromise 1 day in Melbourne.    I would be hiring a car from Melbourne from 19th as certainly no point in keeping a car in city or should I park at any parking station?? Usually I always rent a car outside of cities. So its a drive holiday preferably all scenic routes.    Please guide. We are family of 3 with my 19yr old daughter.. and yes.. need a place for her to Scuba dive .. seems Adelaide has few options.. but any other suggestions which has better reef??    Your guidance will be appreciated..    Other option was to drive to Sydney and back .. as well but thought of covering Adelaide side.. but suggestions are always welcome.

My question is about 3rd party PROPERTY insurance when renting a car in Australia.    I understand about CTP mandatory 3rd party PERSONAL insurance which covers injury or death to a person in the event of an at fault accident and is always automatically included.    I also understand about basic CDW/LDW that covers the rental car itself and that the Excess cost can be reduced by purchasing additional insurance either through the rental company at a premium or another company at a discount.    But I don't understand about 3rd party PROPERTY insurance that covers me in the event I am at fault in an accident that damages structure(s) or other car(s). It is very difficult to find anything specific about this even after booking a car with a zero Excess package my liability for this case is typically only vaguely referred to nothing stating whether I am or am not covered and if so for how much / what detail.    I would greatly appreciate any information about this subject what is required by law what is common and standard what is necessary to ensure coverage for 3rd party PROPERTY insurance. ,JoeBo_2000,,Los Angeles...

I am after some help for this Eastcoast section of Tasmania please. We have visited other parts of Tasmania before but our focus for this trip is this Eastcoast section.    My husband and I are in early 60s and visiting Tasmania in February 2024. We will have our own car and we are interested in sight seeing nature walks and maybe visiting some wineries.    We will have a few days in Launceston at the beginning and then Hobart at the end but I‚Äôm just after help to fill in the middle bit please.    My initial thinking after doing some reading is as follows. Two nights in each of Bay of fires Bicheno and then at Freycinet Lodge totalling 6 nights.    My question is does this plan sound okay or would I be better choosing just 2 locations and spending 3 nights in each? ,Aussieholiday,Glamorgan-Spring Bay,Australia
My daughters (14 and 11) and I are visiting Melbourne in January. I'm looking to create an itinerary of must do's. We live on the Sunny Coast so enjoy a great beach life so we're more keen to see city highlights and any must do's as first time visitors to Melbourne. We're staying in Southbank and will use public transport and tour companies to do the sights.    We're considering a Philip Island trip and a Great Ocean Road trip though I wonder if 2 long days out is too much for this visit. But maybe they're both excellent and if so we'll try do both.    Any suggestions would be most welcome. Thank you ,Kim J,Melbourne,

My parents are going to travel to Japan/Korea for 3 weeks before flying back to their hometown in Hong Kong for about 2 months before flying back to Australia. They have their own private insurance in their HK. Therefore it is possible to purchase the Sydney to Japan/Korea leg for 3 weeks insurance date period ending when they touch down in HK?

Hi.    Is checked baggage (suitcases) dropped off in Australian airports for domestic flights scanned for the same things as carry on baggage is?    One example is: last year when I went to pass through a security scanner in Melbourne or Canberra. I was wearing a healthcare product underneath my clothes and the scanner somehow detected and showed it standing out on the scanned figure of me.    I can't remember what my response was to the security officer when asked what I had on me. But I was allowed to leave. I wonder if it may have been the textile materials of the product that somehow caused it to be detected?    Likewise in future if I instead packed this healthcare product in my suitcase (to wear later). I assume that's ok. It probably won't lead to the suitcase being recalled/flight delay/rejected checked baggage due to any scan concerns? ,IntrovertLikesTravel,,"Hobart, Australia"

Hello    I'm flying into Perth soon for a week (4-11 Nov 2023) and need some help with my last-minute itinerary planning. Going with a 3 year old toddler and my spouse and we are looking at a mix of city and country activities. Kiddo loves nature flowers leaves playgrounds so I think we will spend a bit more time exploring the outdoors vs the city/ town (60/40 perhaps).    Looking at my draft itinerary below it seems we're not doing any justice to the Margaret River region by spending only 2 days there. As excited as I am to visit the Margaret River region (we're not huge wine lovers but ok to do a good lunch at a Winery a cave visit etc) I'm thinking if it's a better idea to skip Busselton Jetty + Margaret River totally and do that on our future trip to WA?    For the 2 extra days freed up perhaps devote a day to Rottnest Island instead and 1 extra day for Fremantle/ Perth City or some hiking around Swan Valley or even the Pinnacle Desert - not sure if it's gonna be underwhelming as we've done the Sahara Desert from Morocco and also hikes around Cappadocia region in Turkey. It does feel a bit like Cappadocia on photos.    Thanks in advance!    ---------  Day 1 (4 Nov 23 Sat): Perth City or Fremantle (overnight in Perth City or Fremantle)  Land at Perth Airport 2.45pm pick up rental car    Day 2 (5 Nov 23 Sun): Fremantle day (overnight in Fremantle)    Day 3 (6 Nov 23 Mon): Fremantle - Busselton Jetty - Margaret River region (overnight in Dunsborough or Yallingup)    Day 4 (7 Nov 23 Tues): Jewel Cave Winery Lunch Cape Naturaliste or 1 outdoor walk around Yallingup area if time permits (overnight in Dunsborough or Yallingup)    Day 5 (8 Nov 23 Wed): Margaret River - Perth City (Overnight in Perth City)  Adventurescape Playground Pitstop / Lunch midway to break the long drive  Hilary's Harbour / Kings Park (if we didn't get to do on Day 1) / Elizabeth Quay    Day 6 (9 Nov 23 Thurs): Caversham day (Overnight in Swan Valley)    Day 7 (10 Nov 23 Fri): Swan Valley day (Overnight in Swan Valley)    Day 8 (11 Nov 23 Sat): Last day food produce/souvenir shopping.

My kids really love motorhome and we planning to have a two weeks trip from Sydney to Blue Mountain. Just wonder is it too hot to stay inside the motorhome when we drive in Dec as I was told the air con of the back seat need to be turned off when the car is driving is that true? btw is any camp site around Katoomba area (or anywhere) can see lot of wild animals like wombat? Thanksss ,Bear F,New South Wales,
Hi all    We are planning for a trip from 31 Dec to 5 Jan. Hoping to get guidance on the itinerary.    We are thinking roughly:  31 Dec - city centre  1 Jan - city centre  2 Jan - GOR  3 Jan - GOR  4 Jan - Mornington  5 Jan - flight home in the afternoon    Wondering if the above makes sense?    Would departmental stores / shopping malls be opened on 31st and 1st?    For GOR how should we plan our accommodations if we would like to do two nights for it? ,Max T,Melbourne,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi there just looking for some advice on what would be more suitable. Pregnant with a toddler but would love to do one of the half day tours to the island - just can't figure out which! Any advice or feedback would be great. ,Sofia S,Cairns,Australia

I will be in Sydney in a few weeks and plan on staying in or near the CBD. I could use some insight as this is my first time visiting the city.    I plan on getting around by public transit and am considering staying by Sydney Central Station. Is the area sage to walk around at night?    Or am I better off staying closer to Circular Quay and trading off easy train access for proximity to attractions even if I need to increase my hotel budget    Thanks for anhy input ,Ribant,Sydney,"Brooklyn, New York"

Hi  I will arrive at Melbourne (MEL) Airport Terminal 2 on an International flight on Wednesday around 18:20. In terms of airport transfer to CBD (Southern Cross Station) I have the following questions:  1- Does the Skybus stop at T2 or do I need to go to other terminals?  2- Is the one-way fare to CBD $AU 19 and can I pay it using a Myki card? If not what are my payment options? My accommodation is on Little Collins Street so I need to switch to a tram for a few stops and getting a Myki card seems essential.  3- Regarding airport transfer using public transport (not a private transfer i.e. taxi Uber etc.) what other options are available?    Thanks ,hrh747,Melbourne,"Tehran, Iran"
Hello  I'm Thai Passport Holder.  I'm Planning to fly to/from New Zealand by transit at Sydney Kingford Smith Airport.    My transit time is just only 2 hours+.    Outbound : BKK - SYD - AKL (Transit time : 6.25AM - 8.50AM : 2 Hours 25 Minutes)  Inbounnd : CHC - SYD - BKK ((Transit time : 7.35AM - 9.50AM : 2 Hours 15 Minutes)    All flights are Qantas with the same booking.    I think the luggage can be checked-thru.    Are those transit duration sufficient?    By the way as transit time is <8 hours I think I can transit without visa (TWOV) if I stay in Airside only (not pass immigration) am I correct?    Thank you for your advice. :-) ,Siwarit,Sydney,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Hi we are travelling to Tasmania in March 2024. We have a spare night on our way to Port Huon.Is the drive from Strahan to Maydena too long and windy. I want to stop at the Wall and a few other stops along the way so this will add extra hours to the trip.

Any tips on daytrips from Goldie? The tours make sense without a car but won't we end up trudging around in a big group ruining the magic?

We will be visiting Melbourne in mid-November for a family wedding and are staying for a week before going to Adelaide and Perth. Whilst I have been before it will be my partner‚Äôs first visit. He has slight mobility problems due to breathing difficulties so whilst a walking tour is not ideal he can walk short distances on the flat.  We are hiring a car so we can visit family who live outside central Melbourne however we will have 3-4 days to ourselves.

Hi....best greetings to everyone in this very useful and wonderful forum....  I'm Italian citizen and in the first half of November for the first time in my life I'll make a short trip to Australia (and New Zealand and both Samoas too) but my questions are not about the trip (although if someone Aussie or Kiwi or of whatever nationality has some travel tips they are of course very welcomed !)...  I've read that in Australia iPhones -although very expensive as elsewhere in the world- are a bit cheaper: e.g the new iPhone 15 Pro Max 256 GB (white titanium the model I am interested about) would cost 2199 A$ [1315 E against 1489 E in my country] but perhaps in searching it would be not so difficult to find it for 2000 A$ [1196 E against 1489 E nearly three hundred euros];  my questions is: it is allowed to buy this iPhone and to bring back with me when I'll have my return flight ? (it will be via Singapore by two different airlines....in the afternoon Sydney-Singapore by Scoot; a night in Singapore overall nearly 15 hours therefore I plan to visit Singapore too; next morning Singapore-Milan via Doha by Qatar Airways);  I'll enter in Australia thrice by three different airports (I have multiple visa UD/601): from Singapore by Scoot to Melbourne; from Apia by Virgin Australia to Brisbane; from Auckland to Sydney by AirAsia and of course I'd plan to buy the iPhone the third and last time before leaving Australia  an alternative it would be to buy it in Singapore (at return) where the price would be 1999 S$ [1375 E a bit more expensive] although the ishop at Changi had the same model at 1850 93 S$ [1273 E better than Australia] but now it is sold out and it is a pity because it was possible to collect it at departure therefore no customs problems I guess  I hope that someone can help me about this question that it can look silly (of course enjoying the great trip is much more important !) but for me is not without importance...I thank you in advance and I beg your pardon for my English ,Massimo V,,Italy
We will be spending two nights at the penitentiary on Maria Island. I have an important (to me) and expensive cpap machine for breathing at night which I can't even use on Maria Island due to no electricity.

I don't think most people will know what it is but it's electronics and I'll need it for the rest of the trip! ,duncanblizzard,Tasmania,California

Hello everyone!!  My family (toddler husband and I) are travelling to FNQ in the beginning of October! it is our second time as a couple but our first time with our daughter.  We will stay from 1st to 6th in Port Douglas 6th to 9th (departure day) in Cairns.  I have obviously a few ideas already but maybe someone travelled already with their toddler and has some gems they found very nice/interesting as a family?    My plans were Hartleys Croc adventure a day to Cape Tribulation (by car with stops to look around eat etc) a day maybe to look around Mosman Gorge Kuranda (Skyrail and the Zoo) and maybe to Fitzroy Island.    Obviously we can't do a reef trip this time so anyone has some other ideas??    Thank you!! ,WombatLoverP,Cairns,

I hope someone can help me. We leave soon to travel and about to do the 651 knowing they get returned quickly and noticed a question about giving a visa number for any previous visas. I had forgotten in 2009 I went with a group of people to interview for teachers. I can find an old email saying I was given the visa number but I cant see it anywhere. Does anyone have any suggestions? There is a number beginning with VK and is 6 letters/numbers long but it looks like the flight details.

I am checking prices for the Kuranda Scenic Railway and the Skyrail and think that I must be missing something.  When I look at the official websites for one way tickets I find the family price for Skyrail for AUS 155 and AUS 125 for the Railway but on the website for the Skyrail there is also the option to book both as a package for AUS 31o but this is more than the 2 one way tickets. What am I missing as it seems strange to me that the package would cost more than 2 one way tickets even thought it is not much more? ,lsm_dk,Queensland,Aarhus

Hello! I'm looking at potentially visiting australia for up to a year on a WHV in 2025 from the UK. My question revolves around obtaining a prescription over there. Due to a disability I currently self catheterise up to 6 times a day and have done for the past 14 years obviously Id be able to bring some supplies with me (potentially up to a months worth but ideally less as supplies can become heavy quickly)    Does anyone know how it would work or how I would go about obtaining more supplies wile I was over there? I'd obviously have medical insurance so would they be covered by this or would it be an additional extra to factor in? Due to my situation I can't be left short so if I was travelling around the east coast would I be able to pre order supplies to a designated pharmacy?    Any intel anyone has is greatly appreciated!! ,Hannah H,,
Back in 2015 my wife and I (both in our seventies) went on a RTW trip which included an 11 night guided tour starting in Hobart and going anti clockwise right round the island back to Hobart.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and now eight years on my eldest daughter who lives near Canberra is along with her train mad sons coming to Tasmania over the new year for ten days with her campervan. There were no children on our tour so I'm unable to advise on places that would appeal to them although we did see children at Cataract Gorge Strahan and Salamanca Place market in Hobart plus I also vaguely seem to remember there was a train museum somewhere.  I'd be really grateful for any advice/suggestions on things to see and do on their trip especially if it had a railway connection of some sort. Many thanks ,WaltR,Tasmania,"Devon, United..."

Thanks so much for all of your help so far!  We are flying from Sydney to Launceston on December 26 arriving 5 pm. Wish we could have an earlier flight! The plan is to pick up the car and drive to Cradle Mountain stopping at either Coles or Woolworths to pick up breakfast and/or lunch food. I'm assuming that it would be better to pick up something quick to eat for dinner as well. Would Coles or Woolworths have prepared food? Or any other suggestions?  We're staying at Discovery Parks at Cradle Mountain in a standard cabin. The plan is to go to the visitors center in the morning buy passes and shuttle tickets and go to Dove Lake.

We were originally to dock in Melbourne for 15 + hours but have now been rerouted to Geelong We will have to tender from the ship to the dock and back which cuts down on our time in port. My question is this - if you have 11 hours to spend is taking a train to/ and back from Geelong to Melbourne worth it? Or is Melbourne just like all other big cities in the world (great for young people who have lots of energy)! We could stay in Geelong and take a GOR trip . We are in our 70's  not a fan of bus tours (Geelong) but no longer bar hopping and dancing (Melborne). ,Kris P,Melbourne,"Tustin, California"
Good afternoon all    This might be a bit of a silly question and I hope you can answer it for me :)    I'm travelling to Melbourne soon and I've got a (fully refundable) room booked at both the Aspire as well as the Meriton Suites. Both are brand new (with the Aspire not completely finished just yet) both have a pool both are in the middle of the CBD and both seem to otherwise fit what I'm looking for with regards to a hotel room. The good news also is that the difference between the two is about AUD$20 so that's not a deciding factor for me. The reviews also don't make one stand out more than the other with Aspire being a 4 star hotel and getting and 8.5 and the Meriton being a 5 star and getting an 8.7.  Would one be better than the other? Is Meriton better because it's a chain? I have a hard time choosing and maybe locals or previous visitors* have a better insight.    *I realise that I'm not likely to encounter many previous visitors to either as Meriton opened in September and Aspire sometime earlier this year they haven't been open for long.    Many thanks :) ,Phoenixx90,Melbourne,The Netherlands
Planning to take a side trip from Sydney to see GBR. We only have 2-1/2 days. I would like to go to Daintree forest and GBR.    Are there direct flights from Sydney to PD or only to Cairns? Coming from the US so prefer not to rent a car and drive on the opposite side of the road than what I am used to. I would like to stay in PD but seems to be less convenient without driving.    If staying in Cairns are there tours that pick you up and drive you to Daintree forest? Or is there public transportation to Daintree forest?    What snorkeling tour in Cairns would you recommend that also has the semi-submarine? I can‚Äôt swim so will have to stay onboard while my teenagers get to go in the water.

Hello husband and I both seniors are visiting Sydney for 4 days next week from Melb.  We‚Äôre attending 2 shows at night at Theatre Royal and Opera House.  Our accomm is in Kent St.  How safe is it after shows close to return to our accomm if we walk and or catch public trans?. (We have our Opal cards).  Are we better using taxi/Uber? If so which is best ride share to use?    In past visits some years ago we‚Äôve found many people around city/cir quay areas after shows end and a very safe & happy atmosphere.

I have never been to Wagga. My trips up North have usually been via Canberra or the Shoalhaven area due to family connections. Years ago I visited the Cowra Japanese Gardens so I Left The Bloke and the cats and took leave of absence to rediscover it.    It‚Äôs about a 4 hour drive from home to Wagga. The weather was cool and overcast and great for driving. Just over 2 hours to Corowa along the Hume Freeway via Wangaratta is a very easy run. It‚Äôs still green; the low lying areas near the King and Ovens rivers are carrying plenty of casual water. Lots and lots of fresh roadkill on the freeway - mostly kangaroos of all sizes probably cleaned up by the overnight traffic which is generally trucks. Once on the Corowa road there was only the odd squashed magpie.    Corowa is known as the birthplace of Federation. There are lots of historical buildings on its wide main street and interpretive boards to explain what you‚Äôre looking at. On a Sunday morning at 10am it‚Äôs a pretty quiet place. One coffee shop was quite full with a noisy group outside so I chose one across the road with a more ‚Äòsedate‚Äô clientele. The owner seemed to know every one. I ordered a strong flat white and was then asked if I wanted an extra shot - cups only have one shot‚Ä¶ Well when my coffee arrived the waitperson apologised for the wait which wasn‚Äôt really long at all. Probably needed to apologise for the coffee. Over-hot and the milk hadn‚Äôt been stretched at all. (Yes yes I know but I‚Äôm from Melbourne).  Anyway it was caffeine and with a brisk walk up and down the street I set off for Wagga.    TBC    Cheers  UF ,Unclefey üçû,,"Broadford, Australia"
Wish to visit a friend in the BM on Boxing Day. I find the instructions on the train website to be confusing especially for one who is not familiar with the line numbers. Due to line-work it seems that I would need to travel part of the way by bus.  Can someone please advise if this is so.  Thanks very much for your help. ,KevinRL,Sydney,"Maleny, Australia"
This is probably a long shot but does anyone know what happened to the Old Melbourne Hotel? Is it rebranded? My husband worked there as a waiter in 1976. He served the likes of Liberace and Warren Mitchel (Alf Garnet) and he would like to visit the hotel if it still exists. It is the Old Melbourne Hotel in Melbourne; every time I google it it pops up as being in Perth. Thank you. ,Janice M,Melbourne,
I know I know it‚Äôs been a while but here is a bleated trip report:  I recently travelled to Geelong for an overnight stay. It‚Äôs a great place to spend a couple of days with heaps to see and do.  I took the train from home into Southern Cross and changed for the Geelong line. It‚Äôs about an hour on the train as you travel from inner city through the sprawling outer suburbs and then a brief patch of countryside between Werribee and Lara. The low range of the You Yangs is to the west.    Just past Lara station I could see the Spirit of Tasmania at its berth. You can get a taxi to the ship from the station.    Geelong station is just on the outskirts of the CBD and a reasonably easy walk to the waterfront although there are buses and taxis right out front if you have a lot of luggage or mobility issues.    I stayed at the Novotel with ocean views which was really handy for the Wool Museum where I had a seminar to attend the waterfront and the small ferry berth for the Melbourne-Geelong service. There are heaps of cafes and restaurants to choose from and the bollard walk. Be warned it is not a short stroll from one end to the other. The carousel is great for people of all ages and abilities with lots of information about its history and renovation. It is not just for youngsters - I enjoyed my ride immensely although Getting down off my high horse was hilarious. There are ‚Äòcarriages‚Äô for people with mobility issues. Near the start of Cunningham Pier is a great adventure playground for children    Even though it was winter the little tourist train was running in a loop out from the carousel to Eastern beach. This relic of more genteel days is well worth a look. I went up to the botanic gardens for a look - it is well set out but not too large.  The tourist information centre is housed in the wool museum and the staff will help you plan your time. The Museum has a lot of textile history and a shop with lots of clothing in addition to the usual tourist wares.    My return journey was on the ferry back to Melbourne. There was only one service available and it left at 3pm via Port Arlington and ending up at Docklands a little after 5pm. There is a cafe and bar on board and it has inside and outside seating options. Very comfortable and a smooth ride.  While you could manage Geelong as a return day trip by train the mid-afternoon ferry departure might cut your day a bit short.    More information on the are here: https://www.visitgeelongbellarine.com.au/    Cheers  UF ,Unclefey üçû,,"Broadford, Australia"

Hello  A few weeks ago I posted a question about where to stay between Melbourne and Sydney and I also mentioned we will spend 5 nights in Box Hill. My husband went to school there in the 1960's and wants to revisit his old school and neighborhoods and visit with relatives. Based on everyone's comments I know that Box Hill has changed drastically but my husband still wants to stay there.    We have now revised our itinerary because we have decided to fly between Melbourne and Sydney instead of drive. If we drove I ended up with a roadtrip of 7 one-night stays and we have decided we don't want to do that. Concerned we will have too much time on the road and not enough time seeing and doing things.    So here is my revised itinerary and I welcome all thoughts and suggestions/improvements.    Box Hill - 5 nights (If we get bored in Box Hill I have some daytrip options such as Yarra Valley Healesville and Dandenong Ranges.)    Roadtrip to include:  San Remo - 1 night - so we can see the Penguin Parade on Phillip Island    Great Ocean Road (3 nights):  Aireys Inlet - 1 night  Port Campbell - 2 nights  OR  Aireys Inlet - 1 night  Port Campbell - 1 night  Port Fairy - 1 night  Will 3 one-night stops be too hectic on the GOR?    Gold rush towns:  Bendigo - 2 nights  OR  Ballarat - 1 night  Bendigo - 1 night    Then Bright - 1 night - to visit Wandiligong where my husband went to camp    Return rental car to Melbourne  Melbourne CBD - 3 nights  Fly from Melbourne to Sydney  Pick up another rental car  Leura in the Blue Mountains - 2 nights  Sydney - 5 nights  We will then fly from Sydney to Christchurch - haven't finalized this itinerary yet.    Thank you!  Karen ,Karen W,,Boston...

I visited last November and will also visit again starting from the last week of November.    When I search on booking.com there are some rentals which are clearly apartments in high-rise apartment buildings with much lower prices than Meriton and similar chains.    Similar amenities self-catering roomy apartments with kitchens and laundry in unit.    Typically they all have parking included which seems too good to be true considering that other places in the CBD charge up to 60 AUD a day for parking.    So these all require submitting request to book where booking.com prompts you to give some general details about who would be staying why they are traveling etc.    I've submitted a few requests and there is no response at 24 hours so booking.com cancels them.    So these don't seem to be valid accommodations available for stays. They don't have any reviews from other Booking.com members. Instead the listing says there are dozens or even hundreds of reviews on external sites.    These aren't in Airbnb so I suspect these external sites would be Chinese because they all seem to list Chinese as one of the languages spoken by the people or company offering these places.    I'm seeing them for both Sydney and Melbourne CBD even some suburbs like Bondi Junction as well. I didn't see them last year when I booked accommodations.    I actually stayed at an Airbnb which similarly charged a lower price than hotels and included parking. It was located maybe a block east of Spencer. But that place had a number of Airbnb reviews so it seemed more reliable.    Has anyone by chance booked any of these places? I'm only seeing them on booking.com though I haven't looked at any other American or European sites like Expedia.    Here is one of the listings:    https://www.booking.com/hotel/au/opposite-the-station-free-park-excellent-location.html?aid=304142&label=gen173bo-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gDaIkCiAEBmAExuAEHyAEN2AEB6AEB-AEDiAIBmAIhqAIDuALlnZ2pBsACAdICJDYyYmJhOGVmLWViN2UtNDJkZS1hMDJiLWEwMmJiOWYwOTEwMtgCBeACAQ&sid=7322bc38f766e502c86a445225b508b5&atlas_src=sr_iw_btn&checkin=2023-11-29&checkout=2023-12-06&dest_id=1593&dest_type=district&dist=0&group_adults=1&group_children=0&highlighted_blocks=1085718201_381464382_4_0_0&nflt=fc%3D2%3Broomfacility%3D11%3Bhotelfacility%3D2%3Broomfacility%3D34&no_rooms=1&room1=A&sb_price_type=total&type=total&ucfs=1&activeTab=main#tab-main    Notice the Host information towards the bottom of the listing.

Hello  I'm a little confused about my options for transportations from the airport to our hotel. The hotel is the Oaks Brisbane Lexicon Suites on Ann Street.    It looks like AirTrain has a special deal right now taking me to the Central Station (is that the station I want for that hotel?) for about $21 round trip. However when I look it up on the map it looks like it starts with a 17 minute walk to get on the train. Is that correct? That seems like a long walk with luggage.    Other people have talked about getting a GoCard at the airport and using that. Is that on that same train or on a bus or what exactly. What bus would I take to get to my hotel or how do I look that up?    We will arrive at about 6:30 pm on a Thursday and the plane leaves at about 5 pm on the next Tuesday.    Thank you! ,Rosanne,Brisbane,

Hi. We‚Äôre a family of 4 who‚Äôve got 3 nights (but only 2 full days) in the Esperance area in mid December as part of a road trip. We were thinking of doing one day at Cape Le Grand NP and another touring the Ocean Drive and stopping off at some of the beaches.    On the Cape Le Grand day we have hopes of visiting Wharton Beach early climbing Frenchmans Peak then visiting Little Hellfire Bay and Lucky Bay. We will have a 2WD SUV hire car but this isn‚Äôt supposed to be taken on unsealed roads. When I look on google maps it seems I can drive from Esperance to Wharton Beach on sealed roads but the route it suggests to drive from Wharton Beach to Frenchmans Peak appears to use unsealed roads (Merivale Road). Do I need to drive from Wharton Beach up to Condigup west along Fisheries Road and then turn left on Tyrrell Road to remain on sealed roads?    If anyone can advise on an app or paper map that shows whether roads are sealed or unsealed roads then that would be very helpful too.    Many thanks  Tim ,timofee,Esperance,"London, United..."
Hi  Thanks in advance for your advice and information.  I am considering a full day tour of the Blue Mountains. It seems like a fantastice 11 hour tour. The desciption reads:    Journey to the heart of the Blue Mountains on this full-day tour from Sydney including hotel pick-up. Kick-off your adventure seeing a koala or a kangaroo at Featherdale Wildlife Park then enjoy a dramatic view of the Three Sisters rocks from Echo Point. After lunch (own expense) head to Scenic World to ride the Cableway Skyway and Railway for unbeatable aerial views of the Jamison Valley and Katoomba Falls. Finish with a leisurely cruise along the Parramatta River to Sydney‚Äôs Darling Harbour or Circular Quay. Enjoy a close encounter with Australia‚Äôs wildlife at the Featherdale Wildlife Park Cruise back to Sydney along the Parramatta River Entrance fees included Great choice for families and kids!    My question or which I am seeking advice please is: In your view is there something missing from this trip that is a must see for a tourist (I know it is subective)?

Hello everyone.    Would anyone know if there are options to request a rental car that has the steering wheel on the left?

My friend and I are flying into Hobart in Early November and have 5 days in Tasmania. We would like to both explore Hobart for at least a day and get out and see the rest of the island probably via auto. We like nature good food and interesting sites. Any help in terms of what's realistic and what is a must see is appreciated. ,mlgmlg,Tasmania,san francisco

Hi all    I am doing two GBR snorkeling tours early next month one from Cairns and one from Port Douglas. My question is from Cairns which is the better tour operator Down Under Cruise and Dive or Passions of Paradise? They are priced and rated pretty evenly and have similar itineraries (one late morning mooring one early afternoon fresh buffet in between). Passions of Paradise does seem to have quite a few more mooring options but both have a pretty decent selection for crew to choose from on the day.    As they are so evenly matched on paper I'd like to get personal opinions from people who have gone on tours with one or both operators recently (within the last two years). Specifically I'm curious to know how long you got in the water at each site (I will almost definitely be just snorkeling not diving) and how helpful/attentive staff were with making the experience fun informative and safe. These are my main concerns. My locations and travel are already firmly set in stone so I'm not looking for opinions on when/if I should travel and do these things in early Sept. Happy to hear about facilities onboard but this is not necessarily a determining factor for me unless they are egregiously bad. ,jacworldtraveler,Cairns,"Seattle, Washington"

Hi    My Fianc√© and I are planning to visit Cairns/Port Douglas next May as part of our Honeymoon from the UK. We are both certified divers and are hoping to do some dives on the Great Barrier Reef. We have 3 days set aside for this and I would like to know if I would be better booking the whole 3 days on one liveaboard such as Reef Encounter or if it would be a better idea to spend two days on Reef Encounter (or another boat) and possibly do a day trip to dive in Agincourt Reef from Port Douglas?    We are both wildlife lovers and would like to see as broad a range as we can as we may never be able to afford a trip to the great barrier reef again. My wife to be is very excited at the prospect of seeing turtles if there is anywhere which gives us the best chance for a sighting? ,Richard A,Cairns Region,County Tyrone...

After submission I immediately documented that I had made the mistake and submitted additional documented as per Home Affairs‚Äô request.

I have looked through many posts and am still confused on what we can make happen within our timeline! First time visiting coming from the US. We have 7 nights but really just 6.5 days given flying time. We are traveling with a rental car in and out of Hobart (can't change our flights to fly out of LST I looked). We have a 7 year old and typically are drawn to mountain areas we love to hike and explore nice scenery. I would love for our daughter to see wildlife and we would like to just get a feel for Tasmania. Is Hobart --> Freyciney --> Cradle --> Hobart a good first taste of the area? I am open to suggestions if it makes more sense to add on Port Arthur or something else not to be missed.    Also best wildlife spotting for kids with this itinerary? Thank you so much! ,Beck B,Tasmania,
Seems like there are many ways to do this attraction.    First of all is booking required at end of November to December? My concern is if the day I book doesn't have the best weather would prefer to wait for a sunnier day.    Secondly is the train worth the time and expense? Seems like you're constrained to a schedule whereas the cable car has more frequent departures so would be quicker both ways?    Or does it offer views that are different and worth seeing since you would take the cable car one way?    The bus I haven't found the schedules but I would assume runs more frequently from both terminuses of the cable car back to Cairns?    The website recommends 2-3 hours in Kuranda. Would people who've done this tour or visited the village agree? ,ag11,Cairns,California
Hello could somebody please help?    My wife and I were recent issued eVisitor visas for Australia but have only just noticed that her middle name is spelt ‚ÄúElzabeth‚Äù on her visa rather than Elizabeth. Everything else is correct just this one simple typing error.    We are now really worried that we won‚Äôt be able to fly as we go in 4 weeks.    I have gone on the DHA website but nothing I can do there as it‚Äôs been issued I have phoned the +61 international number but the person I spoke to couldn‚Äôt say whether we would be let into the country or not with this typing error.    he advised I fill a 1023 form and send it by post to the embassy in London to get it corrected. I phoned the embassy and they‚Äôd never heard of this form but the woman I spoke to gave me an email address of the department who deal with this. I have emailed them and got no reply and we are now at our wits end.    It would be awful to cancel as we are visiting family we haven‚Äôt seen in such a long time.    I have thought about just applying for another visa for her but as one has already been issued to her passport number I‚Äôm not sure if this would cause problems.    If anyone can please help it really would be appreciated.    Thank you. ,PeteBow222,,"Sheffield, United..."

Hi we're heading to the city in a couple of weeks (8 of us) for a 7-night stay and we're just wondering which of the 5-star accomodation options are the 'best' (in your opinion of course). We're looking at something with all the amenities you'd expect in a 5-star (pool spa gym in-house restaurants room service the lot of it) and preferably a good view of the Swan River or King's Park. A bigger spread of options for the breakfast buffet would help as well. Out of the ones I saw on third-party booking websites The Ritz Carlton seems to be well recommended and has great views of Elizabeth Quay Doubletree by Hilton does very well and has excellent river views and so does Duxton Hotel on the terrace the Westin does good as well and has good city views albeit a bit inland from the river the Intercontinental and a few others are well-reviewed but dont do well with the kind of views we expect. Which ones have you personally stayed in experienced the whole deal and would recommend to tourists? Thanks! ,Silver_Surfer104,Perth,

Hello!  I have itinerary inertia - hoping I can get some help. I have now booked a 3-week trip to QLD. It will unfortunately be during the Aussie summer hols except for the last week. We will be one adult one 17 year old and a 9 year old arriving in Brisbane in the second week of January. We want a laid back and cheapish itinerary that includes nature and wildlife/hinterlands as well as the mainstream Gold Coast fun such as the marine park amusement park etc. We would like to see some aborigine/indigenous culture/landscape if possible and not too fake. We won't hire a car and would rather not fly up to FNQ or elsewhere but have not ruled that out. I am thinking of a longer stay in Gold Coast and an itinerary that includes Byron Bay Springbrook National Park perhaps Lamington Rainforest and Sunshine Coast. What do you think? Also we arrive at 20.00 at night at Brisbane - is it worth staying there the night or longer and doing some trips from there such as Moreton Island and then heading south stopping for eg at Sunshine Coast on the way down? Or is Brisbane not worth it really? It doesn't look particularly interesting to me. We are based around Gold Coast region as that is where family member we are visiting lives. THANKS! ,Juis S,Queensland,

Hello! I‚Äôm looking at potentially going to Australia at some point in the next year or two for 6 months-1 year on a working holiday visa from the UK. My questions revolves around obtaining a prescription. Due to a disability I currently self catheterise up to 6 times a day and have done for the past 14 years obviously I would be able to bring some supplies with me (maybe 2 weeks worth as the supplies are hefty and weigh a lot so not practical to carry a prolonged period of times worth).    does anyone know how would it work or how I would go about obtaining more supplies while i was over there? I‚Äôd obviously be insured so would they be covered by my insurance provider or would they be at cost to myself? Due to my situation I couldn‚Äôt be left short so if I was travelling around would I have to pre order supplies to a pharmacy?    Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ,Hannah H,,

We are heading to Australia and have a few days in the Cairns area. We will fly in 1/21/24 and fly out the 25th. We are thinking of staying in the Port Douglas area and will not have a car. A snorkel tour to the reef is a must (I understand this is stinger season) but we have 2 other days we are debating what to do. About us: just me and my husband in our early 50s  -We enjoy easy to moderate hikes (no steep inclines due to knee issues)  -We want to see some nature and wildlife and like tours where a naturalist educates you on the ecosystem  QUESTIONS:  1. debating day tours to Altherton tableland Daintree or Kuranda. What do you recommend? Any particular tour company? We possibly could choose 2 destinations  2. Is there another day tour we should consider that I didn't mention above?  3. Staying in Port Douglas will that limit our available tours to choose from vs staying in Cairns?  4. Any recommendations as to where to stay in Port Douglas?

I would like to have some advice about my Victoria‚Äôs itinerary. I am going to Australia at the end of February for 11 days: arriving in Melbourne at noon and departing in late afternoon after 7 nights/75 days and then going to Sydney for 4 nights/35 days. I want to take a car in Melbourne airport (I suppose it will be around 14:00) and go from airport directly down to Great Ocean Road and spend two nights there: one in Apollo Bay and the other one in Port Campbell or Warrnambool (I love the surroundings and want to spend some time there). Then I want to go through Port Fairy to the Grampians (I suppose I am going to be there in afternoon ) and spend also two nights there (actually one full day) and in the morning through Ballarat and Sovereign Hill I will return to Melbourne and gonna stay there three nights. Thought I have questions:  - Is this itinerary ok?  - Do I need to return the car before staying in Melbourne or it is better to keep it?  - I also want to go to Phillipp island to see penguin parade nobbies and koala center. How would it be better to do it: to go by car or to take excursion from Melbourne?  - Are 1.5 days enough for Grampians?  -Is it worth to go to Yarra valley and to where exactly is it better to go? I am from Europe and I have seen a lot of wineries in my life.  -And finally are 3.5 days enough for Sydney together with visiting of Blue Mountains?    Thank you very much for answers in advance. ,Evelina P,Victoria,"Riga, Latvia"

Hi. We're visiting Darwin in late June 2024. We arrive late afternoon and have a total of 14 nights there. We have a son working in Darwin so are planning to spend a few days in the city seeing his home/work etc as well as some of the sights. We'll then do the Kakadu/Katherine loop then have a few more days in Darwin before we leave. We'll be bringing our 21 year old son with us and may be joined for some of the trip by our 23 year old son who's working there.    I've done quite a bit of reading in the various attractions/sights in the area and want to lock in some accommmodation now while we finalise what we'll do at each place. We're happy to do short walks and to squeeze lots of things into each day but a bit of down-time would be nice too. We're keen to visit Jim-Jim falls but are yet to decide whether to rent a 4WD for the whole trip or just a 2WD and do a tour there.    I'm thinking of spending our time in the following areas:  Darwin ‚Äì 3 nights (2 full days)  Kakadu - Jabiru - 2 nights Cooinda - 2 Nights?  Katherine ‚Äì 3 Nights  Litchfield ‚Äì 1 night  Darwin ‚Äì 3 nights (2 full days)    Does this look like a reasonable allocation of time to each area?  Should we split the time in Kakadu - maybe 2 nights in Jabiru and 2 in Cooinda?    Any thoughts woud be much appreciated.! ,travelmadj9,Darwin,New Zealand

We will visiting from the UK and are looking for a quiet beach break. We will be in the Beaudesert area for a night and then have 3 more nights where we would like to relax from quite a hectic itinerary.    If we travel further from Brisbane e.g. Noosa Heads or Byron Bay we would only be able to stay 2 nights and the third night would have to be nearer the airport for our earlyish flight out the following day. The Gold Coast looks a bit busy for us so we‚Äôd like something quieter. I thought the Sunshine Coast might be a better option but I don‚Äôt know where to start!    We‚Äôd like somewhere we can relax by the beach or pool nothing too expensive or luxurious maybe do a few trips out in the car walk to a casual bar/ restaurant or have a bbq. The chance to see wildlife would be great.    Does anyone have any suggestions or know of any hidden gems?    Thank you. ,Alison08,Brisbane Region,UK

I've been studying these excursions such as Reef Magic cruises where they take you onto their platform and there are either underwater windows or they have submersible rides so that you can take pictures of the wildlife underwater as well as the coral.    But it would seem that the colors would be different than if you snorkeled because the glass may not be clear. Maybe also the photos would lose some sharpness through the windows.    I don't have an underwater housing for my camera though I see that Reef Magic will rent you a camera with an underwater housing.    Maybe another option would be to get some kind of underwater housing for my iPhone.    Reef Magic says they have small lockers to lock up your belongings but you wouldn't be able to put in a larger camera inside.    So if I wanted to snorkel maybe I don't take my camera gear at all on the excursion since I may not be able to secure it.    Or maybe I should just visit the Aquarium if I want to get clearer pictures of colorful marine life versus taking pictures through the windows of the submersibles? ,ag11,Cairns,California

Since I‚Äôve been MIA a little lately I thought I‚Äôd reintroduce myself with a little mini report from a girls trip to the Gold Coast on the long weekend. A future bride and bridesmaids headed up for a girls trip away and a little pamper time and we ticked off a few real gems.    We stayed at a lovely AirBnB in Miami - which I usually do not use but suited our party of five to a T. Decent location and within walking distance of the beach and Miami Marketta where we spent our first night for dinner. We all ordered from different places and shared around a bit had a few cocktails and listened to the live music. We didn‚Äôt realise Eskimo Joe was playing that night and could also hear them through the walls so inched a bit closer to the open door for the big hits.    A bit of shopping at Pacific Fair for the morning then home to change and head to Siblings at Kirra for a lazy lunch. I ordered the Bug and Prawn Risotto and it would have the be one of the best risottos I‚Äôve ever had. Swimming with both bug (being Moreton Bay Bugs if anyone is somehow confused) and prawn meat had just the right subtle hit of chilli and was MASSIVE. I couldn‚Äôt finish all the rice. The cocktails were also spot on my fave being ‚ÄòMad for It‚Äô but between us we barely touched the surface of their extensive liquid journey!    We had a quick afternoon chill at the beach where we got lucky when a couple of humpbacks put on amazing show just out behind the drum lines. I‚Äôve never seen such an impressive display aside from the time we actually went out on a whale watching boat. They were really showing off and it absolutely made my day.    Dinner was late pizza ordered through Uber Eats as we chatted gave each other face masks and played uno.    The following morning we headed out for Brunch and a mimosa each at Paddock Bakery which is the brides favourite GC hang when she visits. I can see why. After much deliberation and a group decision to revisit the next morning since we‚Äôd all decided we wanted to take treats home for the families I settled on the mushrooms. Place was packed but food came out quickly so they clearly have a very effective production line going.    Super quick dip on the way back from brunch.    That afternoon we had a soak and massage session booked at Greenhouse the Bathhouse. The soak session included access to the figure 8 spa an ice bath sauna and Turkish steam room for 90 minutes. It‚Äôs a communal soak session which we were aware of although one group that came in after us apparently missed this memo and seemed a little miffed but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs on the venue. Turkish steam room is my favourite and we may have tried to out do each other on who could sit in the (10 degree C) ice bath the longest.    It was me by the way!    We were told apparently we were losing weight just be partaking in the soak session. Didn‚Äôt personally see the results ;) but it was an enjoyable time.    The hour long massage following was fantastic. We each has different massage therapists and it was interesting talking afterward about our different experiences. One of the girls was quite sore the next day!    That night we headed out to dinner at Light Years in Burleigh which we had booked in advance. It‚Äôs not a large venue so I think this is necessary. It‚Äôs Asian Fusion which is one of my fave cuisines although I‚Äôm often limited in what I can choose with having a nut allergy - I was blown away when I informed me that they are actually a nut-free establishment and therefore nothing was off limits! We ordered a number of share plates all of which were great but my favourites would have been the chicken bao buns and the beef rendang. Also had a pretty fun noughties playlist as the backdrop.    The next morning we headed back to Paddock early (6.30) for breakfast before the long drive home. This time round I had the dippy eggs which were my favourite of the two dishes I had there. I also ordered a fantastic dirty chai iced latte for the road and a selection of treats for the husband and children I‚Äôd left behind - who were absolutely stoked with the gift‚Ä¶ pick of the litter being the cr√®me br√ªl√©e donut (would be WAY better fresh) and the salted caramel pretzel donut. Although‚Ä¶ I think hubby was more keen for a nap‚Ä¶ he was exhausted while I arrived back very well rested and refreshed pleased my time of wild hens parties are behind me to be replaced my chill girls weekends away. ,Shansicles,,"Narrabri, Australia"
Hi  After some information on the Mount Victoria Rd from Ralph Falls to Ringarooma.  Google doesn't seem to recognise it so I was assuming it's a private logging road but have also seen blogs and posts where people have driven it.  Is it a suitable way to get from Ralph's Fall to Ringarooma?  Thanks ,ryanscon,Tasmania,Tannum Sands...
Hello everyone  We are coming to Sydney for 18 days in January to visit family. We have 2 young children 2 and 6 years old. We are spending the first 3 days in Manly to see the fireworks on NYE and then we have a free week (from January 2nd to January 8th) and then we spent a week in Cronulla where my brother lives and then flying back. Wondering where the best place would be to visit 2/3 hours from Sydney maximum. We would be more interested in seeing some wildlife and mountains etc.. as we are spending 10 days by the beach already. I read about the blue mountains but was wondering if it would not be too long to spend 1 week there.  Thank you so much for your help. ,Cannelle M,Sydney,"Tahiti, French..."
We need to book a day trip to the blue mountain for a family of 3 including a 11 yr old fussy kid.    We are traveling to Syndey in 4 days.    Any reliable tour operators for private trips? They charge a bomb I know!    Any personal experiences?    Thank you ,Health F,Sydney,

Hi there there are two of us and we will be in Cairns in early November. I can't swim (not even float) so I don't intend to get in the water. I suppose the only activities I can do are glass bottom boats/semi-submersibles.    Which are the operators that have good activities on board if we don't intend to snorkel? I have come across the following: Quicksiler Cruises Seastar Cruises Reef Magic Cruises grateful for any feedback or other suggestions. ,jellybellymelly,Cairns,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi    I am seeking hotel suggestions. While unsure about the currency conversion rate between Euro to AUD (online reference says –Ñ1 = 1.65 AUD) I am comfortable spending –Ñ100 to –Ñ150 per night. Since I am out for most of the day (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) sterling five-star amenities are insignificant although I would like a gym where I can do my lower back routines for 20 minutes in the morning. I am looking for a clean establishment (preferably with a central location) with daily maid service and a morning breakfast (not continental).    Thanks. ,hrh747,Sydney,"Tehran, Iran"
We are only in Brisbane from 8-5 on a cruise next year. We plan to meet up with a former exchange student from Spain that now lives in Brisbane. Due to the time constraints I would like a good restaurant near the BICT to meet for meal around 1 PM. Any suggestions?    We also have a Kiwi/Aussie friend who lives in the Gold Coast and wants to meet for coffee. Again looking for something not too far from the BICT. Suggestions welcome and thanks! ,Nanner08,Brisbane,Mount Clemens...
Hi    I expect to be in Sydney Feb 12-19 as a tourist. I am thinking ofbooking the The Sydney Boulevard Hotel. Is this in a good location or sightseeing food etc.? ,systemguy,,"Ottawa, Canada"
ETA    Hi  I complied the following information online. Please confirm my understanding.  -Use the official website of the Australian Government to apply for an ETA.  -Applicant must have a valid passport from an eligible country an email address and a credit card to pay the application fee of AUD 20.  -Applicants usually receive ETA approval within minutes. However some applications may take longer to process so applying at least 72 hours before the departure date is ideal.  - An approved ETA is valid for 12 months allowing re-entry as long as each entry remains under 90 days.    Thank you ,hrh747,Sydney,"Tehran, Iran"

It had been quite a while since my elderly mum had been on a trip due to caring for my now departed dad. Just before Christmas last year I asked if she would like me to take her away and if so where to?    Tasmania came out trumps because  1. She had never been there  2. She loves history  3. I‚Äôve been a lot so it was a known entity!  4. It didn‚Äôt involve long plane trips or passports.    Booking so far ahead everything needed to be refundable including the flights so QANTAS business class were booked at the eye watering price of $900 each way pp. (Ouch) I knew getting in and out of the seat would be an issue and the slightly wider seats and leg room made it doable.    The itinerary was based on slow travel with no more than 2 things in a day.  3 nights Hobart (MACq01)  4 nights Freycinet (Saffire no point in leaving the money around for those in the will sorry kids)  2 nights Tasman Peninsula (Storm Bay BnB)  2 nights Hobart (Henry Jones)    Car Hire Avis Toyota Corolla for the full 11 nights. $1800    Knowing that the weather may be freeze your extremities I also booked Blackfooted Pig Lounge at Frogmore Creek and Landscape as dinner options so mum didn‚Äôt need to walk anywhere and I didn‚Äôt need to try and get her in and out of the car. Also meant I could have a nice drop or two.    As time marched on I periodically checked on things like the flights dropped to $500 each way on a weekend sale so I promptly changed the booking there.  Avis also had a sale so I upgraded to the Camry at $1593.  If booking well ahead it pays to check back in case there is a bargain..    Now to the trip itself.    Much to my amazement we actually made the trip. Mum normally uses a combination of a roller walker and a cane depending on where and when. Knowing we were going to have a lot of things to do I made enquiries re wheelchair hire and borrowing at the various places. Most said they may have one but assume they aren‚Äôt available. So Hot Wheels (AKA Mobility Shopper 12) was purchased at the cost of $279 on ebay (Hire per day in Tas I was quoted between $47 and $67) so he paid his passage in a few short days. TBH Hot Wheels was a blessing he was versatile and used to transport bags be pushed by mum and to push mum.  He has small wheels so really isn‚Äôt the SUV of chairs and did occasionally suffer in some off road experiences. Actually I was the one who suffered but hey replaced the weights at the gym.      Hobart ain‚Äôt Hell    Our flight into Hobart was delayed due to no particular reason. I allowed 2.5 hours for the check in process however other than the bag drop machines refusing to weigh and scan the luggage 3 different locations later and ‚ÄúHot Wheels‚Äù in the oversize after a long wait while mum perched on a bench we tapped our way through to the Q lounge in around 30 minutes. They duly noted she would need help out to Gate 9 in the circle bit so a cart was ordered to pick us up from the lift. The assistance guy went to the lounge‚Ä¶ we finally got to the gate and boarding began.    It seemed to take forever for people to disbark and another person requesting assistance came up to sit in 1A. There was no way mum was going to do the distance and navigating the arrivals/departures was a walk in the jungle. I made sure she got the chair. HBA apparently only has one. Finally free I deposited mum in the Saffire Lounge and began the task of collecting bags and car etc. This process took close to an hour bags were out last and the collect queue at Avis arduous. Whatever happened to the Wizard system?    MACq01 was to be home for 3 nights. I booked a Superior Waterview Twin for all 3 and an escape night on the Sunday in a Hunter Room for me. See review.    https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255097-d12399439-r919959499-MACq_01_Hotel-Hobart_Greater_Hobart_Tasmania.html    I went out on reconnaissance to check out Fish Frenzy as a dinner option and then up to Woolworths for essentials that had been left behind. Dependz‚Ä¶ Mum was insistent we could just pick them up in Coles Bay. If you know you know.    The price for fish and chips at Frenzy was the same price as Old Wharf ease of access ambience no brainer. Pre cocktail for me in the Story Bar.    After a rough night mum got lost in the room looking for the bathroom at 3am we headed off to Salamanca Markets. Hot Wheels was wonderful he allowed mum to walk all the way and then to sit and be pushed up hill was not fun but with a just after 8:30 start the markets were not too crowded and we could spend a few $$$. Hot tip there were quite a lot more not made in Tasmania places so check the label carefully for PRC! Call out to Heartfelt for great little hand painted and designed non gender biased toys. With a wheelchair go early as by around 11am it was too hard to manoeuvre.    TMAG beckoned so an hour was spent with almost no one in sight. I love TMAG as it is uniquely Tassie. Off to Jam Packed for lunch as no way was I fighting the throngs at Salamanca.    https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255097-d1108228-r918227006-Jam_Packed_Cafe-Hobart_Greater_Hobart_Tasmania.html    A failed attempt at an afternoon nap for me mum just had to keep sharing her experience we did the 114 Doors tour. Yep I‚Äôm a rule breaker 3 things in one day It was interesting enough but not an essential IMHO. Mum relaxed in Hot Wheels for this one.    Dinner was Blackfooted Pig. Post dinner Lark at Evolve.  https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255097-d8755603-r919958255-The_Black_Footed_Pig-Hobart_Greater_Hobart_Tasmania.html    Sunday dawned bright and sunny. I popped out to Mt Nelson so mum could see the view as we didn‚Äôt have enough time for Kunanyi. This was a history trip it was time for herstory at the Female Factory. They assured me it was mostly mobility friendly and it was. We did the 2 tours and both were excellent. The one woman show is a do not miss and for mum doing the tour earlier gave much better context to the story. It also meant I knew the best path for Hot Wheels. If travelling with a mobility challenged person the site is mostly flat and the only hitch was the ditch of gravel. As mum can use a cane this was doable. Toilets are easily accessible and clean. I‚Äôd pre made some sangers using farm gate to stock up as there is no food onsite. With regard to farmgate one bread place has a queue the other does not. There is a reason. Do yourself a favour DO THE TOUR and pay for it don‚Äôt just try and jump on as it enters the yard.  https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255097-d1725936-r919960775-Cascades_Female_Factory_Historic_Site-Hobart_Greater_Hobart_Tasmania.html    Post tour the sun was still out so we joined the conga line up to the summit. TBH it wasn‚Äôt the best option as there were so many people it was almost impossible to stop Hot Wheels in a spot for the view and the best spots are not accessible too many stairs.  Dinner at Frogmore Lounge.    https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255097-d12986924-r919092818-The_Lounge_by_Frogmore_Creek_Bar_Restaurant-Hobart_Greater_Hobart_Tasmania.html    I‚Äôll follow on with Freycinet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶    (NB some reviews may still be pending) ,GurusWüç∑üç§,Tasmania,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi Guys    Apart from the big guys like Trivago Stayz Booking.com etc.    Are there any web sites were you can contact the owners direct regarding B & Bs Guest houses etc cutting out the middle man.

We are wanting either a Guest House/B & B Apartment/Small hotel in either Hobart or Launceston that gives you that old school personal touch that you don't get with the big guys.

Hi all  My partner and I ( 47 ad 59) will be spending a quick 7 days in WA before a conference in Melb in Feb 2024. I've lived in Melbourne a while ago and traveled around Oz but sadly never made it to WA so decided that I'd at least get a mini taste of it this time. We are flying from Eastern Canada and will land in Perth around 5PM completely drained so we'll get a cab or something into town check in have some dinner and crash.    I'm thinking of spending a couple of days to check Perth and the surrounding area using public transport if possible? Then hire a car and do a bit of a road trip. From what I've read Margaret River and surrounds are really nice the only thing is that my partner is sober so we are not interested in any wine tasting. I presume it is still worth it? We love nature fauna sights and are mountain bikers. Beach is nice for a walk or a short swim but not to spend a whole day there. I definitely want to go to Rottnest but was wondering if we should spend a night there or just do a day trip. I was told not to miss the Pinnacles and to be there early in the morning.    So what kind of itinerary would you suggest? 2 nights Perth Pinnacles another night around Perth? 3 nights around Margaret River?    Thank you all for your help    Cheers    Dave ,RichDCan,Western Australia,"Quebec City, Canada"

Hi Tasmanian travel experts    I will be flying into Launceston and flying out of Hobart with no car. I have a few questions I would appreciate your advice.

Hello to the folks at TA Australia.    We a family of 3 (couple in the mid 40s with a 12 year old daughter) from India looking for a two-week itinerary in Australia beginning mid-April 2024.    We have been to Australia twice first in 2015 (drove down from Melbourne to Sydney) and second in April this year where we looped around an anti-clockwise circuit with Sydney as the base (please see #73 at this link for a quick trip report: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g255058-i121-k14326334-Itinerary_for_a_15_days_in_New_South_Wales-New_South_Wales.html#replies)    I'd like to get some ideas about the places we could could plan our third trip around. To set some context:    - we would have about 15 days in Australia  - we would be hiring a car  - we are into bushwalks/hikes wildlife museums small towns inexpensive but quality urban experiences in big cities (loved Sydney for it's views ferries walks food and shopping; haven't spent time at Melbourne)  - I'm into astronomy and would like to visit places under dark skies (perhaps closer to the Outback)    Some options:  - east coast: fly into Cairns and drive around fly into Brisbane and drive around Sunshine coast (Gold Coast might not suit us as we aren't into theme parks)    - west coast: fly into Perth and drive around northward    - Melbourne to Sydney again but inland this time (we did the Princess Highway in 2015)    - Tasmania: we have been to the South Island NZ and hence have listed this last    Please recommend places we could look into for our third visit to your wonderful country.    Thanks. ,Shashi K,,"Bengaluru, India"

Just wondering if it'll be too cold for the kids.    6) We plan to visit Lancelin Sand Dunes for sandboarding. How is the sandboard rental like? Can we drive a 12-seater van there?

Specifically for biosecurity and customs?    2) For cab I read Uber is the easiest one. Taxi rank is far away. Anyway taxi reviews are horrible.  So Uber is the best way? Need to go to Collins street at 11 PM. (Flight arrival is at 9.45 PM)  Or pre-booked private cab is better at 11 PM?  Does Uber have long queues at International arrival at 11 PM?    Thank you ,Health F,Melbourne,
We are first time visitors to Tasmania and will have 7 days / 6 nights in early November. We have car hire booked from/to Hobart Airport and have had a go at putting together an initial itinerary as follows. Does this look like a reasonable starting point to work from or can we improve on this? We are happy with one-night stops and enjoy scenery national parks walks the coast visiting small towns and well as bigger cities but don't want to try to pack too much in. Once I have a basic itinerary that is workable I will factor in suitable places to stop each night.    Day 1: Arrive in Hobart and explore Hobart possibly including the drive up to Mount Wellington    Day 2: Freycinet National Park including Wineglass Bay and beaches    Day 3: Bay of Fires    Day 4: Launceston and Cataract Gorge    Day 5: Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park including Dove Lake and Marion's Lookout    Day 6: Port Arthur Historic Site possibly including Isle of the Dead    Day 7: Return to Hobart and Departure ,where2travel,Tasmania,"London, UK"
Hello  We‚Äôll be visiting the NSW coast between Eden and Batemans Bay in late October. From there we‚Äôd like to travel to Canberra. We‚Äôll be towing a 22ft caravan so I‚Äôm wondering which route is the easiest? We don‚Äôt mind taking a longer route for an easier drive. Our concern is steep ascents and tight bends.  Thanks so much for any advice!  Suze ,Suze M,Canberra,
It‚Äôs my mums 60th birthday (she very much doesn‚Äôt look nor act like she‚Äôs 60) she keeps saying how she wants to go dancing.

Just need ideas on where I could take her haha ,Danielle J,Melbourne,Chelsea Heights...

Hi everyone we are heading out to Sydney for Christmas and have a week before we meet with family - we would love to do a really special trip. Normally we like to self travel but as we only have up to a week we believe it is better to go with an organised tour of some sort. We are completely open to ideas - we prefer off the beaten track the real Australia but will of course want to see one of the wine regions etc. We would love some ideas of where are must sees and if anyone can recommend good tour operators and/or sites we would really appreciate it. The other option may be train journey ourselves - we are just open to any any ideas at all. Thanks everyone ,Bunny_Bee35,Sydney,"Merseyside, UK"
Hi everybody  I am planning a 5-week-trip either in September 2024 or June 2025.  We are tempted by several spots but we are conscious it is impossible to see them all in terms of budget and time and we really need your advice...  In a nutshell: Red Centre the Bungles the GRR Karinji NP. These places are really far from each other so we'll have to skip one of them.  Several options:  1) arrive in Darwin visit Kakadu Katherine and Litchfield. About 10 days  Fly to Alice Springs visit the Mac Donnell King's Canyon Uluru about 10 days.  Fly to Perth a loop to Karinji Coral Bay F Perron Kalgari the Pinnacles. About 15 days.  With this option we would hire regular suv cars and maybe take day excursions to such places as the Jim Jim Falls F Perron and Palm Valley.  No Gibb River Road nor Bungles with that option.  2) Arrive in Darwin hire a 4WD and drive down to Perth seeing all the places of interests along the way including the Gibb River Road and the Bungles Cape Leveque.  With this option no Red Centre...  3) Arrive in Darwin flight to Broome hire a 4WD and drive up to Darwin. Then flight to Alice Springs.  With this option we would miss the road from Broome to Perth...  On other words what priority should we give among those places? What could be skipped?  Thank you very much for your help! ,Anne Claire,Western Australia,"Paris, France"
We will be in Sydney for only one day after a visit with NZ relatives and cruise around New Zealand. We would like a lunch and dinner experience in Sydney that we could not have in another major US city. We realize that we are in Sydney so understand that we will be among other tourists but hope to enjoy Australian food in a restaurant that is uniquely Australian. We are from a major city in US and love all kinds of food. Not necessary to be fancy but would splurge if worth it. That said not sure how fancy we can dress during a see everything day.    For our one day visit we will likely explore Circular Quay maybe check out Botanical Garden maybe take 3 hour bus tour likely take ferry around harbor and possibly make some stops. Given time constraints we would not be able to travel far for meals. Considering lunch in Watson Bay Pub? Looked into Farmhouse but seems tricky to get reservations. Thank you for any suggestions you may provide. ,jenniferAtlanta_GA,Sydney,"Atlanta, GA"

Hi all we are planning our trip to this beautiful side of the world (we are from the UK) and just trying to be organised and book hotels on free cancellation then I have at least got somewhere to stay. We will be flying from UK to Sydney where we are staying 4 nights. I have been to noosa before so would like to take my wife and 6th month child there. After taking the flight from Sydney to Noosa and staying there 3 nights we plan on heading to Brisbane where we plan on 2 nights before our flight to Fiji. I was maybe thinking of taking the train from Noosa to Brisbane and getting the airport train from Brisbane to the airport on the morning we fly to Fiji. With that in mind I have looked at hotels close by and noticed Hilton and the Sofitel could be potential properties to stay at. As it will be a relatively short stay we are happy with anywhere but want a decent location etc. I stayed at Brisbane almost 15 year ago so my memory of it isn‚Äôt brilliant.    We haven‚Äôt booked the flight from Sydney to Noosa yet so any advice is more than welcome on anything I‚Äôve mentioned. I just thought it would be potentially nicer than the GC but again any advice welcome.    TIA  Rich ,Richard K,Brisbane,
Hi All hope for some help here please. We are a family from Denmark who will make our first trip to Australia in December. We initially got tickets to Cairns but have found out that it is a bit too adventurous for us that time of year not least due to Stinger season which is a total no-go for the family :-) We have therefore changed our destination to Brisbane and are looking to be spending 10 lovely days in the area. We love the nature both beach/ocean/snokling as well as hills/mountains/forest. Delicious organic food from local produce is also high on the agenda.  From a bit of Google research we thought Tangalooma Island Resort could be a good place for us to stay at least part of the visit and Brisbane itself a very nice vibrant place to visit with lots of fantastic cultural- and food experiences.  Advice on anything from great places to stay places to visit restaurants/farms etc. would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance! ,Puble,Brisbane,"Gentofte, Denmark"

Hi    We are a family of 4 including a 8 & 3 yr old and we are flying in and out of Hobart for 5 days in early November.    It is our first trip to Tassie and we know it is no way long enough to see everything there is to see but would like to hear of any recommendations for what we could squeeze in?

I  I would like to hear your recent experience on visiting Australia as a tourist using a UK passport but still having Australian citizenship but not an Australian passport.    lived in Australia for 4 years in the 70s where I became an Austrialian citizen. and left soon after. My Australian passport expired sometime in the 80s not sure of its number etc. or even if I still have it in the loft somewhere. For the last nearly 40+ years I have travelled the world ( but not Australia) on my UK passport . I plan to visit Australia for a few weeks holiday next year and assumed I would just apply for an electronic visitor visa .  However a ramdom conversation with a friend visitng me fom New zealand last week  threw up a potential problem.  This friend emigrated from UK to Australia in the late 60s  lived there for 5 years took out Australian citizenhip returned to the UK for around another 5 years returned to Australia for 2 years then moved to New Zealand where she has lived for 40+ years always travelling on her UK passport never having taken out NZ citizenship. Last year she planned to visit Australia for a holiday and applied for an electronic visa . This was declined as records showed she was still an Australian citizen and was therefore expected to enter on a Australian passport. There was no time to apply for an Australian passport so she enquired about renouncing her Australian citizenship  she was advised this would cost Aus$290 with no idea of how long the process would take. She ended up having to cancel her trip.  Another friend had a similar problem when applying for an electronic to visa for our holiday to Canada last year. The computer picked up that she was a Canadian citizen  applied for when she lived there in the 70s. She had even forgotton the fact but fortunately was able to speak to someone at the Canadian embassy in London who emailed the relevant form for her to renounce her citizenship . The process was completed in a few days allowing her to then get an electronic visa.  My dilemma is to apply for an Australian passport now just to get into Australia or start the renoucing process which could take forever.  I have not had a conversation with the embassy in Lonond yet as so far the line has been busy. ,gem1662016,,Leigh-on Sea...

I'll be in Brisbane for one day later this year arriving on a cruise ship and I'm trying to figure out how to buy a ticket for the City Cat ferry leaving from Northshore Halmilton stop.

We would like to cover as much of the must visit places as we can. ,Anil_Kumar007,Sydney,"Atlanta, Georgia"
Hi    Is there a problem with the http://immi.gov.au site? I got the end of (the quite long) visa application and I've spent all day trying to submit. It says ready to submit but I get an error message We are sorry the expected page cannot currently be displayed Please close this window and return to the department site to try again Obviously that doesn't work and neither does trying with a different browser.    I was kind of surprised that they instituted the visa policy (I'm a US and Spain passport holder) and when I went a few years ago there was only an ETA. Also the help page doesn't open either. I'm worried because they processing time is pretty uncertain and I have a trip in 10 days. ,AbmindprofBCN,,"New York City, New..."
My girlfriend and I are travelling the East Coast of Aus from 11-Nov to 27-Dec (so leaving the UK in 5 weeks time)    On backpacking trips we typically book things 2-3 days in advance but I've read online that we should look to book things well in advance in peak season especially in Sydney over xmas. Is this true?    We're planning to stay in private rooms in hostels / budget hotels most likely travel by Greyhound bus (though also considering a car) and do the typical activities (diving at Great Barrier Reef skydiving surfing etc).    Is there anything specific we should book now or is it okay to just see where the wind takes us? ,MaxFishwick,,"Maidenhead, United..."
We are beginning to plan for our 3 week trip in late April to May 2024 and would love your feedback on our ideas. We are two very active 65 year olds interested in seeing wildlife nature and experiencing art/music/good food in the cities. Here is what we are thinking:    Arrive Sydney and tour around for 3 days (we haven't focused on exactly what to do here yet)    Fly to Cairns overnight at Port Douglas and drive to Cape Tribulation. Spend 2 nights there at Rainforest Getaway (night tour hike etc.)    Drive to Tablelands and stay at Chamber wildlife rainforest lodge for 3 nights to hike and hunt for wildlife    Fly from Cairns to Gladstone and spend 4 days on Heron Island for snorkelling/diving the reef    Fly to Melbourne and spend 4 nights in the area experiencing the city and immediate surrounding areas. Ocean Road? Philip Island?    Does this sound doable? Any suggestions on how to best experience both the city and nature in Melbourne in just 4 days? Any other specific feedback or ideas on our trip?    Thank you so much for all of your help! ,Terry K,Queensland,San Francisco...
Hi me and my boyfriend is planning a trip to Melbourne to attend my sister‚Äôs wedding on the 31/7 . We have lodged our ETA application on the 29th May and I got my visa approved a month later however my boyfriend‚Äôs visa got rejected after waiting for 7 weeks (most likely because of not providing enough evidences to prove that he is a genuine tourist financially sufficient and have no plans of overstaying) He is holding a Malaysian passport.    He had then lodged a application for subclass 600 on the 14th July and a new ETA application on 19th July and have since been waiting for it to be granted.    I want to know if there is any chance at all that he will get his visa before the flight or he will most likely miss the trip :(    Is there any link/email/number I can use to perhaps escalate it?    Please help thank you! ü•∫ ,Wen wen T,,

She is 95cm and I am not sure which one would have more things to do.    We went last year to warner bross in Abu Dhabi (which is similar to movieworld from what i understand) and there were very few rides she could do and also she was afraid of the dressed up people.

Hi there - we will be visiting Adelaide for one week in the next NZ school holidays (from 23 September) and would appreciate any advice on interesting things to do with a 12 year old. At this stage places of interest will be the Adelaide Central Market Art Gallery of South Australia the State Library Glenelg and Hahndorf.. am also keen on shopping & interesting quirky shops! We will probably investigate booking a walking tour as an introduction to the city. We may possibly rent a car for a day or two and explore the Yorke peninsula on the recommendation of a friend. We are not wine connoisseurs and also a wine tour would probably be boring for our daughter so would be interested in any other suggestions (Adelaide Zoo?) We will be staying in an airbnb on North Street so am hoping this is a convenient location as we will be mostly walking or taking public transport/uber. Would also appreciate any recommendations on decent cafes/restaurants - we like good food but nothing super fancy (or too expensive) with the tween in tow - thanks! ,adski,Adelaide,"Wellington, New..."
First I have a major phobia of snakes. Even a quick sighting can make me I‚Äôll.  In late October my husband and I are doing a 28 day cruse around the perimeter of Australia!

I hope you can ease my mind so I can enjoy beautiful Australia!  Please no jokes. ,Annie,,
Thanks so much for the advice you guys gave me earlier on itinerary  My plan now is to spend 5 weeks working my way down from Daintree to Brisbane with more time enjoying rather than driving.  I have a couple of questions that I‚Äôd appreciate your views.  Most sites don‚Äôt need prebooking for October 24 but once on site and we take a day trip in the van do we need to place an ‚Äòin use‚Äô sign as we do on some sites in UK?  We end up near Hervey Bay and Noosa at the beginning of November and I have seen that the online whale watching tours finish at the end of October . Are there any other operators active in November?  All the sites have a camp kitchen is it the normal routine that everyone congregates there?  Many thanks in advance  Philip ,Philr,Queensland,"Weyhill, United..."

We are adventurous seasoned travels just beginning to think about a 5 week road trip to Australia in Septmeber of next year. We are pretty meticulous and careful planners.  What I am looking for is a list of favorite sites that you more experienced Australian travelers use. We find TA and guide books helpful in the initial planning but usually end up using sites that are specific to a country or region once we are past the global planning stages.  What are your favorites sites for Australia? We are thinking we might want to focus on northern Queensland but are wide open at this point. As a rule we don't do cities or tourist resorts. We love to swim eat and immerse ourselves in the local culture. We're not shy but are very respectful and try to keep a low profile. We generally self cater but again we are wide open.  We'd be grateful if you can pass a long some of your favorite planning sites.  Thanks and happy weekend! ,missmarleygirl,,maine

Husband and I are planning a holiday in Australia in January and tentatively flying from Hobart to Sydney on the 26th.  Questions:  1) Will we have problems getting into the city from the airport (mid-late morning)? What kind of street closures might we encounter? What is the best way to avoid any trouble?  2) Considering a dinner cruise on the harbor to see the fireworks. Are the cruises worth it or are they cheeky and touristy? Found Vagabond Cruises and Sydney Princess Cruises as two options. Any opinions on either one... good bad meh? Or recommendations for a different company?  All help greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Hi  We are planning to come to Australia for 5 weeks next October/November time and I am now trying to sort out the GOR/Kangaroo Island last part of our trip. We are two fit 60 year olds who love hiking and wildlife and the great outdoors. We will be coming from Melbourne and plan 2 nights in Apollo Bay 1 night in Port Fairy 1 night in Mount Gambier (to break up the journey unless there are better alternatives) and then on to Adelaide. we don't want to drive more than 5 hours max in one day less if possible.This is where I lose the plot! We want to visit Kangaroo Island for 2 nights and fly home from Adelaide (2 nights here to explore?). Should we ditch the car and get a tour or take the car with us? Just wondered if a tour might be more relaxing but limiting after 5 weeks travelling.  Thank you in advance for your help. ,Sunshine576554,,"York, United Kingdom"

First time to Australia; from Alaska in mid November. Looking for suggestions of areas to stay for our Adelaide portion of the trip. We‚Äôll be flying into Adelaide from Hobart (after a week in Taz); picking up a rental car at the airport. I‚Äôm planning 4 nights Adelaide area 3 nights along the GOR. We‚Äôll return the car in Melbourne. (And then spend 3 more nights in Melbourne using public transport before flying back to Sydney). While in Adelaide we will take some day trips/drives to some wineries (and any other must sees in the area). Ideally we‚Äôd be back at our Airbnb park the car and walk to dinners in the city. We‚Äôll spend at least one of our days wondering around Adelaide too. Which neighborhood near (but not IN) the city center would you all suggest? Easy parking easy access to the main highways yet walkable (or quick train ride?) into the CBD? Hoping for a quaint walkable neighborhood with cafes bars and markets just on the outskirts. ,Allie907,Adelaide,"Anchorage, Alaska"

We are travelling to Tasmania shortly and firstly wanted to thank everyone for the advice and/or suggestions on the forum. It has been a great help in planning our trip.    We are driving from Port Arthur to Bicheno and although I have seen previous posts noting that we should not follow Google maps and go via Wieltanga Road I just wanted to obtain the most up to date information as to the best way to go.    Is it best to go from Port Arthur on the A9 via Copping and then through Sorrell and follow the A3 to Orford and continue along the A3 to Bicheno?    Thank you in advance for any responses. ,lak321,Tasmania,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi all    Would love your thoughts on how to plan a good route in the Grampians.    I have taken note that the popular highlights of Grampians are The Pinnacle Lookout Boroka Lookout the Balconies The Reed Lookout and Mackenzie Waterfall. On Google Maps that route looks quite efficient. Is my assumption correct? Are there any other good spots that I miss?    How many hours of daylight do we need to leisurely explore the best of Grampians? Are 15 hours a decent amount of time?    What should tourists know about hiking safety and the wildlife in the Grampians? Any bears or snakes? Will roos jump onto parked cars (a point of consideration for buying windshield damage cover)?    And will there be toilets and eateries in the national park? ,StElle,Victoria,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Does anyone know any places in the Perth area (or south of Perth) which do a beginners day course for 4wd vehicles but where they provide the vehicle? Ideally a bit of a mixture of sandy/bush driving. I've found a bunch online but they're all in your own vehicle.    Thanks in advance ,JK,Western Australia,"Lancashire, United..."

We will probably be in Sydney on New Year's Day. I know most people go to the beach but we aren't interested in that. Are any of the museums open? Looked on some of the websites and it's hard to tell. What about other activities? Would the train to Katoomba run on New Year's ?    Thanks for any advice. ,wildlife_lover,Sydney,"Silver Spring, MD"
Hi all we are a group of three who will be hiring our own 4WD and touring K'gari Island for 3D/2N likely Dec 27th-29th 2023.    We're keen to avoid tag along tours as we're keen on some solo time peace and tranquility as opposed to a big rowdy group but feel it's best to have another 4WD along for the ride for safety.    Looking for another 1+ groups who will be in K'gari on those dates and perhaps want to join us for some/all of the days of sightseeing. We will be camping but could always meet up somewhere regardless of where your accomodation is- or you can join us for some peaceful camping!    Please reach out if interested! ,Steph P,K'gari (Fraser Island),

Hi all - I am from India and we are required to get a transit visa while transiting through Australia. I was applying for the visa online and noticed that they asked for certified copies of the whole passport? Will I have to get my passport copy notarised? Does anyone have any clarity on this? Especially if you‚Äôve applied for a transit visa recently it would be of great help! ,Shreya Sikaria,,"New Delhi, India"

Hi!    We are coming to Australia for the first time but for 5 days only. We plan to stay in Sydney the whole time. Will come back in the future for other parts of Australia. We will be covering the usual tourist spots that are kid friendly of Opera House Botanical garden Taronga zoo Manly Beach Bondi beach and Aquarium. We usually like to stay in the busiest part of town with life buzzing around us. We also prefer hotels with kitchens/condotels that have a restaurant on-site and a pool as well. Any recommendations of hotels that might meet our needs?    Also is there anything off the beaten track/slightly outside the city that we absolutely must see? ,Sonamp4,Sydney,San Francisco...
Hi  We will be in Tasmania for 7 nights or so next October/November as part of a 5 week trip to Australia. We are two fit 60 year olds. We will fly into Hobart (coming from Sydney) and will have a car. I wondered if someone would be kind enough to advise the best itinerary to maximize our sightseeing time on the island without it feeling too rushed or driving more than 5 hours max/day. We are keen walkers and love wildlife and the outdoors in general. I have come up with Hobart (2 nights) Cradle Mountain (2 nights) Launceston (1 night) 2 nights Freycinet or around and back to Hobart for flight or 2 nights Hobart 1 night Tasmin Peninsula 1 night Bicheno 2 nights Cradle Mountain 1 night Launceston and fly to Melbourne from there.  Any advice and rejigging of these plans would be very welcome thank you. ,Sunshine576554,Tasmania,"York, United Kingdom"

I was trying to get an Australian visa online recently. When I first searched on Google the first thing that came up was https://australiaevisitors.com/e-visa/. I also tried looking at the Australia government website but did not find a proper link to obtain a visa online. Therefore I thought that the website I mentioned was legit. It never mentioned that they were just an agency. I filled out my info on this website and provided my credit card info. It never mentioned how much I would be charged. I thought it would bring me to a review page before submitting but then I was charged 99USD immediately. I found it that it was 99USD because my bank sent me a text message.    It turned out that this website was not an official one. The actual cost of the visa should only have been 20 AUD. I requested for a refund but they replied saying that they had listed their prices and stated that they were just an agency in the terms and conditions section which was hidden in small text at the bottom of their page.    I am posting here just to let everyone know not to use this website to get your visa. ,787maggie,,"Hong Kong, China"

Hi    My wife and I have applied for the Australian ETA to visit the country for a week. We applied the ETA using the app from my phone. After we submitted I realized that in the application I used my photo shot for my wife's. Everything else was correct except the photo! And now both of our applications have been approved.    Is there a way to correct this? I searched the ETA webpage and the answer seemed to be no. I also wrote an email and haven't got any answer.    What's your advice for this situation? Should I reapply (and pay the fee) again? If so how long should I wait? Thanks a lot for anything you suggest! ,Tim Shaw 2023,,

We are an active couple in early 70s with knee issues limiting long hikes and rough terrain but we love viewing nature eating and drinking good food and wine and museums. We have a flight into Hobart on Friday evening in January (26). Plan to do the Salamanca Market and a Bruny Island cruise excursion on Saturday. MONA and Hobart with gardens etc Sunday. Hope to pick up rental car Monday and head up the east coast. I need to be in Launceston Thursday for a flight to Sydney. Would you recommend staying in the Coles Bay area for 3 nights and doing day trips to Freycinet Bicheno for penguins beach walks? Or should I do 2 nights on coast and a night in Launceston. Recommendations in the $100USD range? I know this is a very rushed itinerary and we will be missing many wonders but it is all the time we have. Thank you for any suggestions ,MaryA,Tasmania,"Rogers, Arkansas"
Hello  I am planning a trip to Australia with my husband for October 2024. My husband went to school in Melbourne when he as a teen-ager in the 1960's. This is his first time returning to Australia and my first visit. After spending some time in Melbourne and along the Great Ocean Road we plan on driving to the Blue Mountains and then Sydney.    We plan to make 2 overnight stops along the way. We will be coming from San Remo where we plan to overnight after seeing the Penguin Parade on Phillip Island. We would like to follow the coast as much as possible between San Remo and Sydney. What would be some attractive places to overnight? I am currently thinking of Lakes Entrance OR Genoa for one night and then Batemans Bay for one night. From here we will drive to Leura in the Blue Mountains where we will spend 2 nights. And then to Sydney for 4 or 5 nights.    Both Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park and Croajingolong NP look beautiful and interesting to us. I appreciate any advice you can give.  Thank you  Karen ,Karen W,,Boston...
Hi Tripadvisor experts!    I have one day in Melbourne in March.

hello will the wineries allow only 2 out of 8 pax to do wine tasting? will they let the non-paying guests inside as well? we are a group of 6 adults and 2 kids but 3 of the adults are seniors already and are not allowed wine because of health issues and the other adult would be our designated driver. the kids while not interested to drink wine are curious and wants to know how wines are produced and what wineries looks like in real life as they don‚Äôt want to just look at videos and pictures. haha    suggestions which wineries as well will allow this please!  thank you! ,Bernice,Yarra Valley,

Hello again travel community! Can I just say I am low key obsessed with Hobart!! Haven‚Äôt been in 15 years and loving it! I have Monday-Friday/Saturday free (this week) and has been tossing up a few itineraries but now that there is back burning at Freycinet/Coles Bay I‚Äôm thinking to skip the Easy coast (where I have been before) and head west. A friend had mentioned Lake St Clair- Strahan/West Coas- Tarkine-Stanley might be a good itinerary? I have a long car I can sleep in or get little air bnbs on the way. Keen for nature waking (no more than four/five hours per day due to injuries) and maybe a few nibbles on the back at (lavender for cream; cheese etc). I don‚Äôt drink: W love any and all advice you have! Leaving Hobart tomorrow morning- weather looks gorgeous ansddestination unknown !! Don‚Äôt have to be back until the weekend. Thank you!!

Vic couple arriving in Tassie with a car and golf clubs for 2 rounds at Barnbougle    Staying one night in Launceston on a Monday night - and can leave the Tues morning.    Our next required stop is Claremont late morning on the Thursday for more golf. And after that we're all sorted with Hobart etc before heading back to boat in Devonport    This leaves basically 2 full days/nights i.e. the Tues and Wed undecided. Prefer to stay both nights at the one place - before getting to Claremont.    Any thoughts about a good 2 night stay?    Bothwell would have been ideal (for golf especially) but they don't have golf carts and we need them these days.    Cheers ,Macca3820,Tasmania,"Warragul, Australia"
We are having a long road trip and will probably arrive in Sydney at around 1:00‚Äì2:00 AM on a Saturday. Staying at a hotel could be expensive for just a few hours of rest!

Hi! After spending several days in Freycinet we‚Äôre going to Launceston where we‚Äôll only spend one night before our flight.

We are deciding between these two accommodations. We are an active couple mid 50s traveling with our 20 year old son. Looking to be close to the beach walking distance to restaurants open air sleeping (do not like A/C only if it the last option). Is there a better location on the island? Different property? We thought we would rent a car. Staying 3 nights.    Activities that are must do/ see? We like to have busy days with lots of activities so honestly the more the better.    Restaurant recommendations?    Getting to Magnetic island from Sydney in 1 day (flying into Townsville). Is that feasible or would we be better spending the night in Townsville before the ferry? Thank you in advance. ,Malia O,Magnetic Island,

Hello All    My wife and I will be traveling from Los Angeles California to Sydney Australia. We will have 17 days to enjoy the country. We like to sightsee explore new places try new things. We do not typically hike camp or go to the beach. I'm currently doing some research into what we would like to see and do during our vacation to Australia. Would love to get some recommendations and ideas from residents who are willing to offer them. Also we have decided to visit Sydney and Melbourne. We are currently debating visiting Brisbane. It's all going to come down to if we can do justice to all 3 places with the time we have.    Additional details: We are middle age and are not drinkers or partiers. Travel would be from late June to mid July 2024. Big cities and nearby quaint towns or attractions are of interest to us. Zoos Aquariums shopping high tea (wife enjoys immensely) are all good as well. Budget wise we have planned for this trip so can afford some nice luxuries. We will not have a car but instead we'll utilize public transportation walking and if needed taxi. Thank you for reading and for any suggestions you might offer. ,Daniel A,New South Wales,

Hi everyone  Girlfriend and I are hitting MI next week for 7 days. We'll be staying at Arcadia.    Just looking at transport options is bus the best way to get around on a budget? I've heard they're often too full and unreliable - is this likely to be a problem in the middle of June?    Also is it best to purchase the ferry tickets and a weekly bus pass in advance? I heard it can be cheaper to buy them together?    Thanks very much for your thoughts! ,reallyedbrown,Magnetic Island,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi all!    Several questions about renting a car in Melbourne and Sydney:  - Does Australia provide a free road assistance for tourists? If not is it better to sign up for a monthly road assistance plan with NRMA or just purchase an add-on at the rental?  - Is a compact car suitable for road trips to Great Ocean Road the Grampians and Blue Mountain?  - How important is windshield damage protection at those destinations?  - What tourists usually don't know about driving in Australia?  - When a rental (or any business) says that there is a surcharge for card/Visa payment does that include payment with debit cards (balance in AUD) as well?    I'm going to rent from Advance to venture out from Melbourne and maybe Bayswater Car Rental for Blue Mountain. Any tips would be much appreciated! ‚ó°Ãà ,StElle,,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Hi all!    So this was my experience in August this year in case anyone might be interested.  This was not my first trip to Australia (I wouldn‚Äôt attempt this on the first trip) but it was the most difficult to plan and the most expensive one.  I flew from Europe initially into Melbourne where I got over the jetlag with copious amounts of hipster coffee for 2 days the onto the northwest.    Chose 3 locations for the scenery and local experiences as well as for the possibility of enjoying them car-less and not camping: El Questro Kununurra and Broome.    1. El Questro.  I flew into Kununurra airport from where I had a transfer to El Questro station previously arranged online. Everything went smoothly I had also phoned them during a flight layover to reconfirm the flight I was on. Access to El Questro is via an unsealed road with water crossings (nothing too deep in the dry season) 4x4 only.  I stayed at the Station in a cabin with its own bathroom clean and very close to Reception and the restaurants.  There are 2 options for dining: a restaurant that does breakfast / lunch / dinner and a cantina with ‚Äúpub food‚Äù at dinner and also a bar. Food and drink is expensive but not unexpected in such a remote location. I enjoyed the food and the bar usually has some entertainment (a singer/ karaoke).  Activities were very well organized. I did a full day tour a beginner‚Äôs horse ride sunset tour aboriginal experience onsite and a helicopter tour to Miri Miri falls.  One of the ‚Äújoys‚Äù of solo travel is trying to do activities with minimum 2 people mentioned in the brochure such as helicopter rides. In this case that was circumvented by my paying for 2 (about 530 AUD pp); no regrets however both the heli ride and the swim in the plunge pool at the waterfall are amazing worth every cent. The Heli tour company was actually really nice and offered to make a booking and withhold pay until the day of the tour in case another single wanted to do it. That did not happen but still a nice gesture.  The day tour was also very good led by knowledgeable rangers. It included a hike to Emma Gorge with a swim trip to Zebedee Springs lunch and a river cruise. Emma Gorge is lovely about an hour and a bit each way. It is moderately difficult mostly because of sharp and a few loose rocks no big elevation differences. Hiking boots are recommended in spite of a couple of people walking it in thongs/ crocs (I swear they are a different species). At the ‚Äúend‚Äù you can swim in the plunge pool water is quite cold but beautiful to swim under the waterfall. Then hike the same trail back to Emma Gorge station. Zebedee springs was also fabulous (I thought it would be a bit lame but it was actually v good and relaxing it feels like a dinosaur might step out from the foliage).  Horse ride was fun everyone that day was at beginner level luckily the horses knew what they were doing. For more advanced riders there are longer ride options.  Without a car there is not much to do on your own apart from the organised activities. There is one short walk up a hill at the Station called Telegraph Hill with nice views especially early in the morning (didn‚Äôt go early enough for sunrise but just after was still good).  The Station has a very pleasant feel many people read or sunbathe on the grass near a small section of the river that is amenable to swimming or simply splashing around. It feels safe and nothing is too...loud just a perfect place to get away from it all.  Final rating for ElQ: 9.5 out of 10.    2. Kununurra  From ElQ to Kununurra I again booked a transfer from the ElQ reception they dropped me off at my hotel which was Kimberley Grande Resort. The accommodation was ok but calling it ‚Äúresort‚Äù is a bit much. Nice pool area however the room had a quite strong musty smell when I got there. It was probably from the a/c since it faded away after I turned it off (luckily I almost never need it anyway). There were 2 big signs in the room warning to always keep all doors locked at all times for fear of thieves which while helpful was also a bit off putting and didn‚Äôt help getting rid of the smell as I could only leave the sliding door to the courtyard open only while I was in the room during the day (so not much).  Oh and a small frog kept appearing in the bathroom near the sink. Didn‚Äôt really do anything just hid behind one of my toiletry bottles so I left it alone. No I did not try to kiss it to check whether it was actually a prince.  The hotel was across the street from a nice park around Lake Kununurra where you could walk/run/ bike best early in the morning.  The walk into town for shopping is 15 min but not a scenic one for sure. I found the town centre very meh to be honest.  I stayed 3 nights / 2 full days and did a lake Argyle cruise and an air tour + hike to the Bungle Bungles.  Lake Argyle was impressive especially if you are a bird enthusiast which I honestly am not but still found it interesting. Rock wallabies and freshwater crocs are among other fauna here. The tour itself was well organised (Lake Argyle tours was the company name) and included drinks and snacks and the opportunity to swim in the lake at sunset.  The trip to the Bungles was with Kingfisher tours. Lovely flight and an amazing aboriginal guide on the ground who really helped us to get a bit of understanding of the region‚Äôs importance to the native people. We walked Echidna Gorge and Cathedral Gorge. The walks are not difficult per se Echidna has a lot of shade after about half way. Cathedral Gorge walk is mostly in the sun. A lot of water (byo bottle) and a lot of sunscreen needed. Highly recommended.  Final rating for Kununurra : 7 out of 10 (and that mostly for the brilliant Bungles tour).    3. Broome  Going on to saltwater territory.  I flew into Broome with Airnorth. The approach into BME airport is stunning window seat is definitely worth it.    I got around Broome using taxis and the Broome explorer bus (very helpful but does not go to the airport and last bus is around 6:50-7 pm schedule on their site). Chinatown taxis was who I mostly called with waiting times between 5-25 mins. Around 25-30 AUD for trips from Cable Beach to Chinatown area something along the lines of 50 AUD from the airport.  Accommodation: 6 nights. I stayed in the Cable Beach area. Boy was this something.  Had originally booked Mantra Frangipani and when I walked in after check-in everything looked nice. A large living room kitchen with cooking utensils and a large fridge (I had even bought some fruit and groceries on the way from the airport) nice bedroom good bath products (large bottles of brand name handwash/shampoo not the little useless ones). The only odd thing was that the type of room I booked only has an outdoor shower. Bit odd but again it looked nice and obviously the weather was warm.  Went out and returned to the room after sunset. Now sunset in the tropics is early (around 17:40 in this case) so you will usually get back to your hotel and have your evening shower in the dark. The thought did cross my mind that showering outside in the dark in a tropical place I might be accompanied by bugs but I thought I‚Äôd be quick. Just quick enough since when getting ready to go back inside I noticed a big bug between me and the door. Made a run for it and managed to close the door /insect screen just in time to realize...these bugs also fly. Like in a horror movie it flew at me/the light in the room but was thankfully kept outside by the closed door. Phew that was a lucky escape....  But then it became apparent that more of the let's call them giant flying cockroaches resided in the kitchen area and I managed to kill a few with the insect repellent that was under the kitchen sink. After which the rest of the night was spent clinging on to the can of insect repellent in bed. Oh did I mention I have a deep phobia of bugs?  Yeah that was horrible. And before you say it was the tropics bugs can get inside... Nah too many to have all come from outside I always close doors/window screens. They had a stronghold in that place.    The manager changed my room the following day but I then decided I could not spend another night risking it so I moved to Kimberley Sands and no more bugs.    That naturally soured my first 2 days in Broome but afterwards things started looking up.  I went to the Broome Aquatic Centre for lap swimming quite a few days it is a great 25m outdoor pool best to go early in the morning to avoid the UV index of around 1000.  Cable Beach is absolutely amazing there is a place to rent sun lounges and umbrellas yet it is still nice and quiet. Tides have a range of up to 10m so be careful where you leave your stuff on the beach or the ocean takes it.    Went to the ‚Äúother side‚Äù (Town beach / Chinatown) for a stroll one of the days including the Broome museum. Nice little museum makes one think about a lot of stuff some pleasant and many not so pleasant.  Beautiful area around Town Beach turtles to be spotted off the jetty.  Chinatown area was so-and-so I have no interest in expensive pearls and the rest of the shopping is nice but nothing to write home about IMO.  Had lunch / dinner at Zanders on Cable Beach a couple of times good food and even better view. The barramundi and the fish tacos were delicious.    As for the touristy stuff I did the following:  ‚Ä¢ Camel sunset ride: ok but I kind of wish I hadn‚Äôt done it can‚Äôt say exactly why but I have some concerns about the camels‚Äô wellbeing (maybe imagined but it seemed to me they were less happy than the horses at ElQ). Pleasant but a very touristy experience.  ‚Ä¢ Air Kimberley tour ‚Äì namely the Buccaneer Explorer tour. Wonderful flight over the horizontal falls and time at a very remote beach with a bit of swimming and a visit to the Ardyaloon Hatchery run by local Aboriginal guides. A few people got sick on the flight it is on a small aircraft but I for one found it thrilling.  Wanted to do another tour initially but they understandably have a 4 passenger minimum so no more luck.  ‚Ä¢ Kayak with Broome Adventure. Loved it - saw turtles a few whales in the distance and a myriad of birds. Previous kayak experience not needed.  ‚Ä¢ Greg‚Äôs Astro tour. Worth it if only to see a dark night sky with a stunning Milky way but also a nice talk.  ‚Ä¢ Bus to Gauntheaume point (first bus of the morning only) and walk back on the beach. Nice way to start the day lively music on the headphones recommended to put some pep in your step.  ‚Ä¢ Dinosaur adventure tour. Shows you around dinosaur tracks in the Roebuck bay area then a slow cruise and dinner in their seashore location. Enjoyed it very scenic area and good food at the end.  ‚Ä¢ AOC sunset whale watching tour: this was fabulous. So many humpback whales 2 of them (including a calf) breaching with good commentary from the marine biologist onboard.  ‚Ä¢ Sun Pictures outdoor cinema. Movie programme and tickets available online. Nice retro feel good snacks and drinks selection. Seating is in deckchairs byo blanket and dress in warm clothes. Got taxis to and from.  All the organised tours offered hotel pickup and drop off.  Final rating for Broome: 9 out of 10. It would be close to perfect if not for that horrible first night.  I flew to Perth from Broome for one night and then flight back home.    Would I go again? Yes to ElQuestro and Broome. I wouldn‚Äôt go to Kununurra again without a car considering my preferences. There are Bungles tours from Broome and one with pickup from ElQuestro both more expensive and longer day but do-able.      Don‚Äôt know if that helps anybody but I thought I‚Äôd share my views.  And thanks to the forum regulars for helping out with planning!    Cheers!  Claudia. ,Claudia X,Western Australia,
We have been to Broome about 4 times in the last 15 years. Really shocked to see that the town seems to be dying. The Nightrider bus service has been cancelled obviously no money in it which means it's hard to go into Broome town at night and then reliably get a taxi back to Cable Beach. Seems that there is only 1 cab company operating at night. We tried to get a meal after the movie at Sun Pictures at 8.15 and restaurants were closed. Then waited over a half an hour for a cab. Sorry this will be our last holiday in Broome. ,MadamJosephine,Broome,"Melbourne, Australia"
Anyone have any recommendations for some of the nicer apartments and managers on Hamilton island? Ideally catseye side so was looking at lagoon frangipani or hibiscus    I‚Äôm just worried as I know they are all individually owned and managed so we could rock up and get a dirty one or dated.    Id normally book direct (instead of Airbnb) and that looks like https://www.hamiltonislandholidayhomes/ is the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù one? But they don‚Äôt have reviews of individual apartments so hard to know    Does anyone have any recommendations on specific rooms or specific property managers that ensure the property is clean/respond to any issues? Preferably one that may have been recently renovated too if possible ,DK,Hamilton Island,

I currently have a Citibank plus card which I organized 6 years ago for a Greece trip. It has been fabulous and I have used it on every trip since. I have ING cards also. Citibank has now been taken over by NAB so in a few months the cards will all change. I am not a fan of the big 4 banks so going forward is my ING card going to be suitable? I have read about the Latitude 28 card - are there any other good more recent cards out there that have good exchange rates and no fees? I do have a Qantas travel card but am not a fan of that arrangement. ,LeeLou64,,"Perth, Australia"

Hello. We are two active seniors coming into Brisbane from a cruise in early April. We will have 3 days before we fly out from the Brisbane airport to another stage in our trip. We are still planning and we know that we would like to go to the Koala Sanctuary perhaps by the river cruise. We also love to take hop-on-off tours (or the local equivalent of trams local buses etc) where we get to drive around and get the layout of the city and see the sights and architecture. We will not have a car and would prefer not to take an uber or taxi. What would the best area for us to stay in that would allow us to walk around the typical tourist areas markets (which we do for several hours each day) and knowing that we will probably plan on taking the Air train to the airport? Once we know what location to look at we can look for hotels in that area. Safety and convenience to tourist locations is important and we tend not to be out late at night so restaurants are important but bar/nightclubs are not. Thanks for suggestions. ,Cynthia F,Brisbane,"Saint John, Canada"
Hi!    Im from the UK.    Me and my wife are planning a campervan holiday along the east coast of Australia.    Our third stop is Port Stephens.    We've hired our motor home and now we're booking accommodation for the places we want to stay.    Having never visited Australia or Port Stephens before we are a bit in the dark for where best to stay etc. We won't have any other form of transport other than the motor home we've hired so ideally would like to stay somewhere within local walking distance to towns restaurants beaches etc.    Could anyone recommend anywhere in Port Stephens?    Thanks ,Hannah F,Port Stephens,"Birmingham, United..."
After a year of reading and planning our trip to Australia and New Zealand is coming up this October/November. We will have almost 5 full days in Sydney then a cruise along the eastern coast of Australian some time in Sydney on our changeover between cruises day a cruise to New Zealand then one final day in Sydney. So it seems like we should be able to cover a lot of ground. We are very fit 60 y/os.  A few specific questions before I finalize our plans and make reservations (and yes we have both of our visas.)  --We definitely want to see Australian animals! I've heard the Taronga Zoo has wonderful views of Sydney as well as a great ferry ride but the zoo itself is not specific to Australian wildlife. Would this be preferable over the Wildlife Sydney Zoo? One advantage of this is that there is a discount pass available for several attractions in which this is included. We also have plans to go to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane.  --We live in Florida so visiting a beach to go to the beach is not too important to us. But we want to observe what makes beaches special in Australia. Would love to hear the pros and cons on Bondi Beach vs. Manly Beach. We would probably do a coastal walk for either.  --We will be in Sydney the weekend of the 50th anniversary celebration of The Sydney Opera House. I am on the waiting list to get information about attending that weekend. Would it be crazy busy to do that or should we just schedule a regular tour? We may consider doing both and booking a tour for our cruise changeover day.  --We plan to hit all of the highlights including a day trip by train to the Blue Mountains. Would we miss something by not going to Scenic World? I have motion sickness and don't know if I could handle that.  I have a few other places on my list that we can probably fit in but I would like an opinion on these: Sydney Observatory Chinese Garden of Friendship and the Sydney Tower Eye.  Finally I'm not sure what to expect for planning our first day after traveling for 24 hours. We're considering doing mostly walking that day including walking across the Sydney Harbor Bridge the Cahill Walk seeing the outside of the Opera House and walking the Royal Botanic Gardens including seeing the view from Mrs. Macquarie's Chair. Am I overplanning for that day?  Thank you so much for all opinions. I will probably post our itinerary for critique when I finalize more. ,jajsmom,Sydney,"Orlando, Florida"

We're plotting a visit to do the East Coast of Australia provisionally Sydney to Brisbane then Brisbane to Airlie Beach probably over first 3 weeks of October. We'd like to drive one leg and fly the other - on the basis that driving the whole lot would be too much for us.    Our question is Which is the more interesting drive Sydney-Brisbane or Brisbane-Airlie Beach ?    PS We only really know we want to visit GBR and Sydney - any other special places on this route ? ,Norm,Great Barrier Reef,
Hi guys!  I am considering renting a campervan in Airlie beach and ending up in Sydney after 7-10days in beginning of December. We are 2 adults 35yo and our 3yo daughter. The reason i thought of renting a campervan is to be flexible to decide last minute where we want to sleep and also not having to check in and out of hotels every day. However while researching i see that we will not be allowed to park on the road and sleep in the campervan and that we should stay in camper sites. As December is peak season I understand that i will have to book space in a camper site ahead of time. Is this accurate? Or in some towns we will be able to park where we want? ,Efi1,Brisbane,Athens

Hi all and pardon my very general question. DH and I are scheduled to take a wildlife tour of South Australia in January that leaves from Adelaide and includes Tasmania and Kangaroo Island. We want to add more time in Australia on our own. Definitely plan to spend several days in Sydney with a day trip to the Blue Mountains. Had originally thought to also include a stop at Uluru but it's really hot in January so not sure if that's advisable. Also considered the Great Barrier Reef ( we are experienced snorkelers but don't scuba) but again it's the rainy season. Assuming we have several days to use what one area would you suggest we add to the trip? Thanks for any advice. ,wildlife_lover,,"Silver Spring, MD"
Hi all -    My husband and I are finally booking the nitty gritty of our (probably once in a lifetime) trip to AU! We're working out our in-country itinerary now but want some recommendations.    We arrive in Sydney and depart from Brisbane. This is how our flights worked with EVA Air (our preferred airline) so this cannot change.    Days 1-4: Sydney  (fly from SYD - AYQ on Day 4)    Days 4-6: Uluru  (fly from AYQ to MEL on Day 6)    Days 6-9: Melbourne  (fly from MEL to either PPP or HTI on Day 9)    Days 9-12: Whitsundays  (fly from PPP/HTI to BNE on Day 12)    Day 12-13: Brisbane  - Depart Brisbane at 10:30pm on day 13 so more like 1.5 days in Brisbane.      Our alternative is to drop Ayers and either extend time in Melbourne to more slowly enjoy the Great Ocean Road or spend more time in Brisbane at the tail end.      We really want to squeeze in seeing Uluru/Ayers just to say we did (even in the heat of summer and though it's just 1 full day) and we definitely want to do ReefSleep one night in the Whitsundays. I also want to drive the Great Ocean Road.    Any feedback from seasoned travelers and friendly Aussies will be much appreciated! :) ,Benergy84,,"Chicago, Illinois"
My wife and I have planned a holiday in Australia. Oct thru Dec 3rd this year. Starting in Adelaide and making our way to Sydney. After this leg we have planned 1 month to make our way from Sydney to Cairns via the coast. We have hired a car for the journey (would have loved a motorhome but the prices are now astronomical). I was hoping I could get some good advice on where to stop what to see and any hidden gems that folks would be able to tell us about. Is 1 month enough? any recommendations on accommodation site seeing places to see places to avoid (if any) would be greatly appreciated. When we reach Cairns we are flying to Perth to visit friends before departing back to Scotland. Thank you in advance JD ,John D,,
So pretty much all you locals permanently advise us tourists to avoid driving before dawn and after dusk once we leave the cities and I get it. However this strategy may help to reduce the likelihood of road kills but small risks will obviously remain so I wonder: what are you (legally) supposed to do in case you do hit an animal?    From my previous trips (some 20 years ago) I seem to remember that those long road trains in the outback don't even bother to stop at all even if they collide with a bigger roo and I guess nobody expects you do get help or call it in when you roll over a reptile. But what about a medium-sized mammal? Are you supposed to notify a local authority maybe even wait until they arrive? And what if you hit an animal and then realize it is critically hurt and suffering? Should you try to kill it to end this suffering or would that be a serious offense? ,olivernorwellhardy,,"Cologne, Germany"
Hello  are there any good snorkelling publicly accessible spots between Gold Coast and Cape Tribulation where you can just drive your 2wd car walk for a while and snorkel without tours boats etc.?

Hi Experts would like to have your advice on the following itinerary.    I will be flying to Perth on the 25th May 2024 with my 2 grandparents my wife and 3 kids (9 61)  For the first 3 nights will be living in Perth City doing the usual stuff wildlife park kings park northbridge etc    On the 28th May I'm thinking to drive down straight to MR for maybe 3 to 4 nights exploring the region and doing farmstay etc.    This is where i need u guys for advice If i leave MR on the 31st May which other places can i go that is similar to MR because our flight back to Singapore is on the 3rd June and I don't want to be in Albany or Denmark on the 2nd of June because that would mean a very long drive back to the airport on the day itself.    would appreciate all comments and suggestions! ,MatthewMak,Perth,"Singapore, Singapore"

I can see there is train route to Belgrave then with 695 bus- runs between Belgrave to lake side station.( through Lawson rd stop) but is it possible to go with Uber or Taxi? Just thinking a back up plan if bus not run or any train delay from Cbd to Blegrave that day‚Ä¶.

Hello guys!!!    I really need a bit of help. I am planning with my wife a trip to Autralia for next year. We would like to spend (ard abt 14/16 days ) doing a motorhome trip. We are flexible on the dates and also on the destination.  Our interest are beaches snorkeling wildlife landscapes and we would also like to visit tropical areas (jungle if possible). We dont need big cities. Thats why I was thinking on a motorhome trip from Sydney to Cairns end October??  Then I realized 15 days is a bit too short for such a long trip and our idea is to relax and not spend 5/6 hours every day driving.  According to our interest what can you recommend us? ,Michael V,Queensland,"Santiago, Chile"
We will be flying into Hobart and heading to Freycinet Tasman Island and then west through Hobart. It looks like the fastest route to Freycinet would be the A3 along the coast. Since we will be taking that same road down to Oxford on our way to Tasman Island is there any benefit to taking the longer inland route north on 1 and then east along B34 through Lake Leake or A4 through Avoca? Unless there's something really special we wouldn't have much time to stop anywhere along the way. I'm just wondering if the different scenery would be worth it. ,mdod,Tasmania,NC
We have planned a quick pre Christmas trip to Melbourne mostly to see Moulin Rouge from 12 to 18 December 2023. Daughter wants a shopping day and my MIL will go with her but I'm opting out to explore some of Port Phillip Bay. If the date matters this is planned for Friday 15th.  Shall I go to Portsea/Sorrento or head to Queenscliff. I like heritage buildings museums and art galleries and maybe a short walk on a beach. It looks like about 3 hours on the train and a couple of changes but I'm okay with that. I can head off early in the day. ,BellaD,Melbourne,"Auckland, New..."

We spent two wonderful nights in Sydney this week staying at the Shangri-La. We travelled as a party of four; my husband and I and my elderly parents. It was a special occasion visit and we had booked two Grand Premier Sydney Harbour rooms.    Tuesday 26 September  We left Canberra just on 10am and had an easy drive up the highway stopping midway to stretch our legs and refuel with coffee and snacks. We arrived in Sydney shortly before 2pm.    We had our luggage held until our rooms were ready and used that hour or so to walk across part of the Harbour Bridge. Getting to the Bridge was made easy for my parents with lift access just a short walk from the hotel. For us the Shangri-La is perfectly located for the type of city-break we enjoy - with incredible views over the Harbour. We had a low-key take-out dinner from an Italian restaurant in the Rocks.    Wednesday 27 September  Rising early to catch the sunrise over the harbour we had breakfast at the hotel (Altitude) and then made our way down to Circular Quay. We purchased tickets for the Manly ferry and enjoyed the ride across the harbour. On our return we relaxed with ice creams in the shade outside the MCA whilst watching the ferries come and go. My husband and dad then returned to the hotel and mum and I headed into the CBD for a spot of shopping. We had tickets for the 7:30pm performance of Miss Saigon at the Opera House (Row L - great seats!) and arrived early enough to enjoy sweeping views across the Harbour before the show (which was magnificent!).    Thursday 28 September  Waking early again this morning we spent a lazy morning relaxing in our rooms before heading up to Altitude for brekky. We left the hotel right on 11am and made the easy drive south back to Canberra arriving just short of fours hours later (with a brief stop midway home).    Trip highlights:  - the easy drive up (and down) the highway from Canberra to (and from) Sydney  - the location of our hotel and the views from our rooms  - the ferry ride from Circular Quay to Manly (a simple experience that never fails to impress!)  - seeing a performance at the Opera House (our first time!) and  - the beautiful springtime September weather.    We had a terrific mid-week getaway; it was the perfect city-break for us and we are looking forward to a similar visit mid-December.    Thank you to the TA forum regulars who help visitors like us make decisions about our time in your city. Your time and efforts are appreciated. ,MissyKAus,Sydney,"Canberra, Australia"

Looking for an economical option for an SUV rental for pickup at Sydney Airport.    We need a vehicle capable of handling a fold-up electric wheelchair plus 2 to 3 large suitcases and 3 passengers. We normally drive a Subaru Forester and that works great with the wheelchair.    The duration of our trip is 3 weeks but looking on VroomVroomVroom online the cost of a Toyota Rav4 SUV appears a bit prohibitive at just under AUS$2000. We may have to forgo keeping the car for the entire trip and just keep it for the first week.    Are there any alternative rental companies outside the big brands that are reliable and accessible at Sydney Airport? ,Michael H,Sydney,Palmerston North...

Hi all I jumped the gun and got myself an eVisitor visa for my trip to Australia in September because I got mixed up on Google and thought that these took several months to be accepted - it was actually accepted within minutes. Since doing this plans within the group have changed and I now want to get my First Working Holiday Maker Visa (417) for entry in September.    Do I need to cancel my eVisitor visa or will applying for my WHV automatically void the eVisitor? Am I even able to do this and if so how?    TIA! ,Sam,,"Port Talbot, United..."

Hi everyone    This might be a bit of a stupid question but I live in a very different climate.... I'm travelling to Sydney and Melbourne mid-November until the end of November. I know it's spring over there during that time and that there might be rainfall (not unlike home I might add!).  Are the rain showers there more like in tropical countries where it rains hard for like an hour and then it clears up? Or are they more like my side of the globe where it rains/drizzles for hours? Now I'm sure you're all wondering why I'm asking hahah. I have lovely shoes to wear whilst over there but they're running shoes and they're not waterproof. I'm just trying to figure out whether or not I need to invest in some waterproof shoes as well ;) And if it rains like it does in a tropical climate I could seek shelter for a bit and wait it out. But if it rains for hours and hours... I'm not going to sit inside and wait for that to pass obviously so I'd have to brave the rain with my possible new waterproof shoes.    Many thanks! ,Phoenixx90,,The Netherlands

Hi everyone we are arriving to the Sunshine Coast airport around midday on Saturday and will be staying at the Monaco Apartments in Caloundra. We have a pretty good lay of the land in the general areas as we were there in Feb this year but not sure where we might be able to watch the AFL Grand Final on Saturday that's within walking distance.    I know that the music festival is on at Kings Beach so the surf club there is probably out.    Any suggestions? Thanks for your help. ,JustAllie,Sunshine Coast,"Mildura, Australia"

Hi All    I don‚Äôt have a huge budget so not eating fancy while staying in Sydney for two weeks.    However I would like to splurge on one night (or day) to have a dining experience to remember.    My criteria:    Solo diner    Nice views/ambience unique to Sydney. Entertainment would be a bonus!    Good quality food over quantity as I‚Äôm not a big eater. That said I‚Äôm happy to space out several bite-sized plates over a couple of hours or for as long as the establishment will have me!    Food preferences lean toward European/Modern Australian/Asian Fusion. I enjoy a bit of surf and turf but not into offal.    Budget $100 for one diner.    I know it sounds like a lot but if anyone has any recommendations I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!    Thanks ,Carissa T,Sydney,"Perth, Australia"

Hello all trying to plan our itinerary for March 2024 flying into Sydney early March 4 nights there onto Byron Bay for 2 nights Surfers Paradise 2 nights Noosa 3 nights (is this too long here?) we then want to go to Cairns and maybe Port Douglas for 3/4 nights? Problem seems to be getting from Noosa to Cairns as hardly any flights would it be better to bus it back to Brisbane and fly out from their instead? Then on from Cairns and fly to Whitsundays (Hamilton?) for 4 nights then back to Sydney for flight home to Manchester as there seems to be more flight options from Sydney back to the UK. We have from 3 March til about 27 March in total. It just seems a lot of flights maybe too many Im unsure if we should cut something out and stay places longer or push through the travel in order to see as much as possible in the time we have available. Advise welcome please. Thank you. ,Shellduck,,"Liverpool, United..."
Hello  we (2) are now in the middle (ok more at the start) of our sabbatical travel around the world. We start in southeast Asia then move to south Asia and from there in May or June might go to Borneo and Indonesia. And it comes to mind: Australia is so close... And the flights are so cheap (not like 1000 ‚Ç¨ from Europe). Maybe it would be worth a trip?  However our travel is not limited by time but by budget we set. When we run out (agreed upon) of money we go home (in theory at least :D ). Which might mean we might be looking at a choice of 3 months in central America vs 1 month in Australia and then one needs to think hard :/    There is one single reason for us to consider visiting Australia: Wildlife. Ok there might be other reasons but they are tertiary at best. As most of the iconic fauna (koalas cassowaries frilled lizards probably unspottable platypi) live on the east coast that is where we should focus. I am thinking Sydney/Melbourne to Cairns probably not as far as Darwin. We were considering such a trip last year still working but given the price of flights we went to Brazil instead.    Anyway based on what I read the cheapest way to do this is to rent a car and camp. BUT as we are backpacking around Asia we have no camping equipment with us. So maybe the best option would be rent a small campervan for two people. That might (?) also provide for a decent sleep more decent than tent at least.    When you have a campervan is it possible (and advisable) to sleep wherever (obviously not highway side lane but you get what I mean)? Supposedly there are also (free?) showers at some gas stations or parking lots.    We would be willing to eat only what we get from groceries possibly having a cheap fast food or cheap restaurant meal once or twice a week. Or we'd just buy a gas burner and a pot and cook (or it might come with a campervan). Or both.    On the other hand we are willing to spend money when it makes sense: a wildlife reserve entrance fee a trip (preferably by a ferry :D) to an island with loads of wildlife whale watching or such. We would not dive because I better do three dives on Komodo for a price of one dive at the GBR.    I would like to avoid summer/winter holiday but I think we would reach Australia sometimes in August possibly September (or even in June and postpone Indonesia if it was needed for some reason). I feel spring would be better.    THE MAIN QUESTION IS into how much budget do you think we could realistically fit ourselves for 4 to 5 weeks of travel? I have seen a campervan company rental saying it would be 30 AUD/day pp plus NP entrances plus flights but I am doubtful that is possible... I purposedly do not state any amount we would still be willing to spend. So what do you think what are your experiences? Is such a trip even viable to start with?    Thank you :) ,Asanoth,,

Hi! I'm headed to Perth in December with 2 grandparents in their 70s and a 3 year old toddler. I'm interested to stay 2 nights in Scarborough (probably airbnb). I will likely be coming from Lesmurdie Falls area and intend to use Scarborough as a base to visit AQWA Hillarys Harbour and strawberry picking in Gnangara before heading into CBD for a few days.    The articles I've read online seem to suggest that Scarborough is a family-friendly town. However I've also heard that Scarborough is a rougher town with lots of police activity due to the pubs. Is this true? And if true which parts of town should I avoid or which other family friendly coastal town would you guys recommend please? TIA! ,Ting,,"Singapore, Singapore"

We were hoping to return our rental vehicle at katoomba on a Sunday and take the train back to central station  sydney (lots less hassles and we dont need the car as we staying right near central station).  ive tried to book hertz vehicle online but it advises we cant return on weekends as the office is closed. this seems really strange (ive never had that with a rental vehicle before). Is there another rental car company we should use? Or where would be a convenient easy access (without having to drive into cities) next to train station place we could return a rental car? ,nzp0ppy,Blue Mountains,Nelson-Tasman...
Hi everyone we will be visiting Perth in Early November and are looking for recommendations for fresh seafood at reasonable price.

Post GBR cruise we will fly into Melbourne and spend 3 nights sightseeing. Would like a mid range hotel in CBD with access to Gardens as well as museums. On morning 4 we will pick up a car rental and drive out for 9 days on the road ending back in Melbourne at the airport for flight to Hobart. I have been looking at Vroom Vroom and see there are rentals available in CBD. We will be going to Kangaroo Island and a written permission to drive car over is required. I don't know how to get that permission and also arrange to drop off car at airport. Any help with that hotel recommendation and suggestion for transit from airport to hotel would be very appreciated. First time in Australia and trying to book as much as possible on my own. After Tasmania we fly to Sydney for 3 nights and then a New Zealand cruise. Trip of a lifetime! ,MaryA,,"Rogers, Arkansas"

I am planning a 8 days for my almost 70 year old dad who will be travelling solo to Sydney in 10 days and for the first time from Canada! He just finally decided to take the leap of faith.  May I get some feedback for the below itinerary I have drafted for him? This is my gift for him and will plan and pay for most activites. However I have never been to Austalia so this is all based on internet search...  Day 1: Arrive at 7:15 am at airport -> taxi to Central Station -> store luggage at storage shop ->2 hours train to Katoomba -> buy tickets for him for HOHO bus and Scenic World ->Wildlife Park -> Stay in Katoomba for the night  Day 2: Continue wandering/hiking in the area like Echo Points/3 sisters -> train back to central station in the evening -> stay in Sydney (CBD area)  Day 3: Buy him a go city pass Sydney and go on a HOHO bus to explore city China Town  Day 4: Full day at Taronga Zoo; taking the ferry to the zoo  Day 5: Sydney opera guided tour (1 hour) morning -> Whale watching tour afternoon  Day 6: Bondi Beach to Congee Beach walk  Day 7: Use Sealife 4 Attraction pass: visit Sealife Wild Life Madam Tussands Sydney Eye  Day 8: Royal Botanical Garden and free day for souvenir shopping  Day 9: morning flight out    Are they any passes that you would recommend? I see some from Klook Viator Go city or Sealife... Also other than Taronga Zoo that offers senior rate are there other tours/attractions/transport that would offer senior rate without requiring the Australian senior card?    Many thanks again!!! Much appreciated. ,Rhoda T,Sydney,

Hi hubby and I are thinking of a driving holiday from Melbourne to NSW in early March next year. So far the places we will head to are Bathurst Blue Mountains and Canberra on the way home.  I‚Äôd love to stay in a small beachside town for a few nights and would love to be right on the beach. I‚Äôm not too concerned whether it‚Äôs a house a unit a cabin in a caravan park but really want to walk out directly onto the beach. Budget would be up to $350/nt max.  I have found a cabin at Easts Beach Holiday Park in Kiama but wondering if anyone has any other suggestions of accommodation in different towns preferably south of Sydney and where we can cut back over to Canberra.

The places in capitals are where I planned to stay overnight.    Depending on where we fly home from (either Sydney or Adelaide) I can swap those days around fairly easily.

My wife and I are heading to Perth from the USA next July. We'll spend 2-3 nights in that particular city for an occasion and then we will have roughly 14 days to kill before we go home. We have been to Australia once before (5 years ago in July) and absolutely loved it: flew into Melbourne and drove Wilson's Prom to Great Ocean Road flew to Port Douglas flew to Whitsundays and then on to Sydney. So all that said where should we go in Western Australia (or Australia in general since we clearly don't care to fly around the country while we are here lol) during our two weeks in and out of Perth?    Would y'all suggest heading north towards Exmouth or south towards Margaret River / Esperance or maybe both? If we tried to do both how would you divide the time? Again we don't mind flying around or even eating the cost of a one-way car rental.    Also would it be safe to wait until right before we flew out or even right after we got to Perth to book lodging for the non-Perth parts of the trip so that we could say lean more heavily towards northern WA if it was going to be a whole week of rain in the south or make some other snap decision like Broome or Adelaide?    Thanks for any insight!! ,JB33A,Western Australia,Russellville...
I will be flying into Yulara on Dec 18 at 9:30 am and flying out on Dec 21 at 2:20 pm. I will take a day trip to Kings Canyon with AAT on Dec 21. I therefore have all of Dec 18 and 19 and the morning of Dec 21 to visit Uluru and Kata Tjuta.    I know that renting a car is the most recommended option but I have never driven on the left-hand side and am nervous about driving in the dark when going to/from the sunrise/sunset areas especially when going to Kata Tjuta. Are there many cars doing the route--such as the pre-dawn drive to Kata Tjuta--that I could follow in a sense?    Most solo travelers who write on the forum seem to take the HOHO bus. However since I would like to do the Valley of the Winds hike in Kata Tjuta and the base walk at Uluru it seems like neither the 1-day or 2-day pass work for me since the HOHO bus goes to Kata Tjuta for sunrise only in Dec and by the time I will return to the resort after doing the Valley of the Winds walk there will be no bus to go to Uluru in the late morning/afternoon except to see the sunset. The 3-day pass also does not work since I will go to Kings Canyon on Day 3. If I am missing something and anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it! ,SRG,Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park,"Albany, California"
Many thanks for your suggestions and comments on my itinerary for Feb/Mar and thanks @HunterRes for clarifying where some of the attractions are in relation to where I will be staying. That saved some time Googling distances. I have tweaked my itinerary according to what we want to see and have taken your advice and we will be driving to Mornington Pensinsula first via McClelland sculpture park Flinders Blowhole Arthur‚Äôs seat (or it may be just one of those if we are enjoying ourselves) then taking the ferry from Sorrento to Queenscliff. Would you recommend Queenscliff for an overnight stay or anywhere else on the peninsula? I thought we would drive round the Bellarine Peninsula have a coffee and a walk before we headed off to Apollo bay via Kennet river. The rest of the itinerary is the same - Apollo bay Woollambool Halls Gap and Ballarat. Final day drive back to Melbourne to drop hire car off - I presume M8/M1 is the best road to take? Sorry perhaps I am overthinking this all now! Just getting a wee bit anxious about all the warnings on here about hook turns traffic and not driving in Melbourne unless you can help it!  One final question after reading that Phillip island is very cold in the evening. Although we are not visiting there can I expect it to be cold in the evening anywhere else on the GOR / Grampians?

Hey there we are planning a road trip from Melbourne to Cairns for about 7 weeks. We have a baby on board so would prefer to avoid driving more than 3 hours a day. Distance seems manageable multiple itineraries suggest this should be ok. We plan to start around February 21st in Melbourne and then work our way up all the way to Cairns where our trip would end around April 4th or so. What is your view on the time and distance? And will this get too hot humid and rainy once we go north of Brisbane?

Can you recommend a western or SW suburb for an easier exit from the city? Many thanks! ,Martha G,,"Morrison, Colorado"
I am a single 30yo woman who will be traveling solo to Sydney in late October/early November. I will be staying a week. As I would like to stay on hotel points I am trying to stay at Marriott properties. I love walking around experiencing areas and a big focus on of my most trips is food and drink and meeting people. The goal would be to use public transportation the majority of the time. I was looking at primarily Pier One Marriott Sydney Harbor or Sheraton Hyde Park because these seem central? What would you suggest or should I consider somewhere else?    Thank you in advance! All other recommendations are appreciated. :) ,Abby,Sydney,
Hey Oz experts! We are now planning a Camper Van trip from Melbourne up until Bundaberg for about 6-7 weeks. We have vacationed in a Camper Van before but never that long and never in Australia. I was wondering if you had any tips and recommendations what to watch out for when booking. Is there any recommended platform? What do we need to consider when choosing the car? We will be with a baby so that will mean some additional requirements for the car. Any help is hugely appreciated! ,Daniel,,"Rudersdorf, Germany"

Hi I'll be visiting Australia and New Zealand in November/December and I'm between these two itineraries (only showing the relevant parts not the parts in Australia before nor in NZ after)    day 1 arrive in cairns (flight from sydney)  day 2-4 cairns  day 5 cairns to airlie beach (bus)  day 6 day trip to islands  day 7 ??  day 8 flight to Auckland  day 9 auckland  day 10 leave Auckland for about four weeks in new zealand    day 1 arrive in cairns (flight from sydney)  day 2-4 cairns  day 5 cairns to auckland (flight)  day 6 auckland to bay of islands (bus)  day 7 bay of islands  day 8 bay of islands to Auckland (bus)  day 9 auckland  day 10 leave Auckland for about four weeks in new zealand    This will be in mid november like nov 10-20. Anyone have a preference between the two? Basically if anyone has been to both how does whisunday islands compare to bay of islands? The big difference between the itineraries is the 8 hour bus from Cairns to Airlie beach. ,dayexday,,
Story is I arrange travel from Europe to Australia for myself (Australian) and my child (EU citizen only) without the mother (too busy with her job).  I research and work out that the 651 Visa is suggested. I apply and it¬¥s granted for my child. However what strikes me as curious is that although the visa information pages mention the rights of the child and the need to have permissions from non-accompanying parents this matter never came up when in the application process. I was never asked who will travel with the child (date of birth clearly shows she is under 18) and who is permitting it. I wait some days and the department of home affairs says nothing. Finally I call them for clarity and the woman who answered basically said three times to me if the visa is granted nothing else is required only that you answer the questions correctly (yes) and no circumstances have changed (none have). I ask her if I am supposed to carry documents since the immi online system won¬¥t let me upload after the visa is granted. She obfuscates doesn¬¥t really answer directly and not long after the conversation is at a dead heat in a way so I thank her and the call ends.  I did further research online and one unrelated embassy site mentions that the visa is granted assuming that all permissions are correct from parents/guardians.  It just seems vague to me and further as a person trained in computer systems I can¬¥t understand why their system doesn¬¥t seem to notice a child application for a visa and why no alarm bells are raised as to why the child is traveling and with whom.  Has anyone else gone through this or a similar situation? As it stands all I know to do is travel on the day and I have no doubts the airline will see the visa is granted and not blink an eyelid so the only moment of challenge will be at the border on arrival in Australia. That seems weird and unfair because imagine if people arrive and don¬¥t have correct permissions because the immi department never asked only to then maybe be told by border security that a person can¬¥t enter for their holiday? I can definitely imagine it is a case that could end up in court and frankly I see the government being the party at fault for failing to inquire correctly. ,S D,,Palma de Mallorca...
My family and I will be traveling to Melbourne November 28 through December 4 and are looking for some help with our itinerary. We land at 9 am and then will be renting in a car and driving from place to place. Below is our rough plan so far. We would appreciate any tips on places to stay (myself wife and 1 year old) and if this route makes the most senses. We prefer exploring nature landscapes animals etc.    Nov 28: land at 9 am and rent car. Drive to Anglesea Golf Course and do kangaroo tour. Then continue on Great Ocean Road. See Erskine falls. Stay in Apollo Bay.  Nov 29: Great Ocean Road. Kennet River Mait‚Äôs Rest walk. Then drive to 12 apostles and Gibson steps. Stay in Port Campbell.  - Thoughts on trying to see Hopetoun Falls and Beauchamp Falls? Loop walk along triplet falls?  Nov 30: Plan to drive towards Dandenong. It is a long drive (~4 hours) and so we were going to maybe do afternoon Puffing Billy train ride. Suggestions on the specific train route Belgrade to Lakeside? Visit Dandenong Ranges afterwards.  - Tips on where to stay?  Dec 1: Healesville Sanctuary. Winery in Yarra Valley (Zonzo Estate De Bertoli?).  Dec 2: Head toward Philip Island. San Remo for pelicans at noon. Visit the nobbies. Penguin parade in the evening.  Dec 3: churchhill heritage farms. Koala Conservation Reserve. Explore more of Philip island.  Dec 4: head back towards Melbourne area maybe 1 day exploring city?  Dec 5: flight to Sydney at 8 am.    Thanks in advance for any advice! ,David S,Melbourne,"Salt Lake City, Utah"
So there was a change of itinerary with Qantas and we are now flying to Gold Coast instead of Ballina. We arrive via Sydney at 8 pm in November end. We plan on doing a one way rental and stay in Gold Coast is 2 full days now. Any ideas of how to plan those two full days at Gold Coast? We were considering the Hinterland drive for a day. Also any suggestions of where to stay in Gold Coast. We were planning on staying at the Beach shack in Byron bay but will need to cancel it.  TIA ,A J,Gold Coast,
Hello    Is it true that this food hall is closed for renovation? Do you know when it will reopen?    Thank you  Anna ,Anarte13,Melbourne,
from searches i know this question has been asked before but i'd appreciate to be able to ask some questions. I'm a solo traveler and planning to be in australia mid to late october. It's my first time in australia and possibly my only time given distance and expense. I initially was debating between trying to add on Uluru or Kakadu but it seems like the time period isn't a good one for Kakadu so that might not be worth the expensive tour i was looking at. Uluru is obviously expensive as well (though it seemed like Kakadu is more). I have a drivers license but have never driven on other side of road and given expense of being solo am thinking if i go i should just do tours.    Anyway here are some questions  1. is the main reason that people fly into alice springs because it is cheaper and because they are renting a car and doing a road trip? Is there another reason?  2. In addition to seeing the uluru I know that if i go i want to do a day trip to kings canyon (i dont think i can do this on my own without a car. i found a tour for $200 australian dollars. Any other suggestions to pull this off?) and another day do the valley of the kings hike. From research it seems like the hop on hop off is a good option for my situation since they have a 4:40 AM sunrise departure that allows for a 3 hour valley of the winds hike (does anyone know if that covers the whole hike?). Is something like this a good idea    day 1 - arrival -  day 2 - day trip to kings canyon  day 3 - hop on/off for sunrise hike/ valley of kings then hop on/off to uluru for sunset  day 4 - leave    so the hop on/off seems like it's a one day pass. Is there anything else I'm missing that i should look into adding? Any suggestions on minimizing cost are appreciated though i know it's expensive no matter what. Also any thoughts on Kakadu in my time frame are appreciated as well. ,Michael R,Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park,

Hi all    My birthday is coming up (end of November) and I am looking to plan a 3-4 day getaway.    I live in Melbourne and have not explored much of Australia so I am hoping for some recommendations.    - This will be a solo trip  - I would like somewhere budget friendly  - Somewhere with beautiful sand and clear water anywhere in Australia  - Easily accessible from the airport/train station without a car (unfortunately I don‚Äôt drive which makes it hard)  - I do enjoy dining out as well so I would prefer not too isolated without many restaurants nearby    Any help will be greatly appreciated :) ,Romz,,"Melbourne, Australia"
Even with searching I haven't been able to find the answers I'm looking for. I understand that the excess is what the US calls a deductible. I have three questions.    1. This question revolves around the people liability. If I cause a multi-car crash how does the coverage work for any injuries to the people in the other car? I believe my trip insurance will cover my medical.    2. Second how is the other person's vehicle damage covered?    3. I've looked on TripCover. They seem to be primary coverage and don't seem to take into account the excess from the rental car company. ,duncanblizzard,Victoria,California
We are staying in Cairns next week and have 1 day left to plan. One option is a day trip driving up to the Daintree discovery centre the alternative is visiting Mareeba Atherton and the Table Lands.    Any advice about which option might be best? We're quite into wildlife and nature spotting. We felt the Daintree would be a more unique experience and a rare opportunity to see and learn about the forest but equally unsure what the drive might be like or what to actually expect.    So any thoughts or recommendations appreciated. ,unessential,Cairns Region,Southampton...
We're thinking of visiting Darwin and Kakadu (from Melbourne) to explore the Australia outback nature & get in touch with the aboriginal culture too.    Have about 5 days (flexible) and thinking around Nov or Dec time.    Currently thinking roughly:    Day 1: Fly in to Darwin. Hire car and drive to Kakadu and spend day here.    Day 2: Another day in Kakadu    Day 3: Another day in Kakadu + drive to Litchfield in arvo    Day 4: One day un Litchfield area + drive to Darwin city    Day 5: spend day in Darwin (night try to time the market) and then fly back at night      How does this look roughly?  Would you change anything?  Should I consider Katherine or any other places?  Is it distributed okay? (Noting 3 days in Kakadu)  Anything else to consider?      Thanks ,Chloe P,Darwin,"Melbourne, Australia"
Now I know this can all change within the next 7 months but we're doing a cruise that leaves Sydney in Feb 2023 and as it stands at the moment the cruise company (Princess) require all passengers to provide a negative covid test - either PCR or Rapid Antigen test within 72 hours of boarding the ship  The test must be supervised / authorized by a Dr or other such health professional from memory.    We are planning on having a couple of days in Sydney pre-cruise so my question is - where can we get a supervised covid test done in the Sydney CBD? (we're looking at staying near where David Jones is)    Princess cruises may be offering / doing tests at the port / check in but we'd rather get one done beforehand and have all our paperwork in order so we don't have to queue to board the ship.  Of course if they drop the need for a negative covid test then there's nothing to worry about    but any advice about where to get a test if necessary would be helpful ,Nick in NZ,Sydney,"North Shore, New..."
Hi    My partner and I are planning a road trip from Brisbane to the North Queensland and heading back again to Brisbane. We are planning a total of 15 day trip in late Dec during the Christmas break. I have not done any research till now.

What places and sightseeing would you suggestion for that time period?  Thanks. ,AM,Queensland,
Looking for the cheapest possible way to get to Brisbane domestic terminal for a 6:30am flight.    We were convinced to get a 5 day Gold Coast pass for our time in the GC and then Brisbane City centre at the Airtrain station today - $129 for 5 days‚Äô worth of public transport including our transport between the airport and GC GC and Brisbane City and finally Brisbane back to the airport on our last day.    We‚Äôve since realised this has partly been a waste of money since the trains between Brisbane and Airport don‚Äôt start early enough to get us there in time to check in for our domestic flight so we‚Äôre desperately trying to work out an affordable way to get back to the airport to minimise how much money we‚Äôve lost on this.    Does anyone have any suggestions? We need to get to the airport for 5:30 so probably leaving at around 5am at the latest. ,Sam,Brisbane,"Port Talbot, United..."

It had been implied to me by one of those all knowing experts (we all know so well....) that I would have to pay for an Australian visa. I put australian visa application in to Google and it bought up Australian Visa - Welcome to Australia (comes up as TRAVELAUSTRALIA). I filled it all in and paid then only realised when filling the second one in (for my wife) it was charging me ¬£99 USD !  Why was it charging me USD ?  And $99 is about ¬£80 !  It was then I realised something was wrong I checked on the FCO website used the link to the actual Australian Govt website where they state the visa is free :    https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/evisitor-651#Overview    I immediately tried to cancel the pending payment on my bank account but the bank said I could not. I had to wait till it was paid and then I could dispute it but only if I did not receive the visa.    As a supplementary question will I actually get my visa from this dubious outfit ?  And a rhetorical question why do Google (who are world class virtue signallers) accept adverts from companies charging - a lot - for visas which are free ? ,JustinSmith,,Sheffield

Good morning    I‚Äôm going to France next April.I thought I might see an elderly relative in the US if a RTW fare made it good value. I had a very helpful person at Flight Centre from their complex airfare section price it but I‚Äôve decided against extending to the US- it‚Äôs just too long away too complex. So I‚Äôve decided just to do Syd- Paris return. Two of us are travelling but on different outward dates.    I want to go Singapore Airlines. I could book on their website but am wondering if I should buy it thru the FC agent seeing as she has gone to the trouble of pricing that complex fare which I‚Äôm not buying. Is there any advantage to using a travel agent these days for a straight forward return fare? I see you pay $99 ( compulsory) via FC which guarantees against a drop in fare but think a drop is unlikely (?) I wonder if inserting an agent into the mix makes things more difficult in the case of getting a refund or changing dates ( esp. once you‚Äôre away)?    As always advice much appreciated. ,sasanqua,,Sydney

We've had an email today from Virgin Airways to say our flight in Feb from Melbourne to Perth has had a time change. We now arrive at 2pm later than initial booking. We plan to have a hire car booked and drive straight to Yallingup - I think about 3 hours (?) but wondering now whether we should spend our first night nearer Perth. Any thoughts ? Not sure how efficient car hire process is but thinking we may not hit the road until maybe 4pm? - or later if there's a further delay. ,Nokka59,Western Australia,"York, United Kingdom"
Husband and I are flying into Perth on 14th Feb from the UK. Staying 3 nights in Perth and then our intention was to hire a car and go north as far as Ningaloo. We have 13 days to do this so it seemed like it would be possible stopping at various places enroute then fly back. We have been advised that the one way fare for the car would be 1000$ so we are having another think about the itinerary.  We think it would be too much driving to go up to Ningaloo and back in the 13 days well aware of how vast the area is and then not enough time to explore! Should we maybe just go as far as Monkey Mia although Ningaloo appeals a lot.  Another option would be to fly up to Exmouth and back to Perth and hire a car up there. With this option we would then miss out going to Kalbarri which was one of the highlights.  Any thoughs?  Sorry so many questions! ,CapitalN,Western Australia,"Edinburgh, United..."

Hello. I‚Äôm arriving at Sydney Airport from NZ on Sunday morning later this year. I have a 8 hour layover before flying to Singapore and my luggage is checked through. I‚Äôm quite confident from previous posts that travelling to see many of the sights is relatively simple. This may sound a rather naive question but what is the process to exit the airport and return to the transit area. Is it as simple as possessing an ETA Passport and boarding card for he onward flight and leaving sufficient time for clearing security. Thanks for any advice. ,David B,Sydney,
Hi all    Family Rider pass and Day Riders for travelling in Perth and Fremantle can only be bought at the train stations? No other places?    Cos I think the beginning of my journey is on a bus first before hitting the train.    If my hubby and I are travelling with a 12 year old and a 4 year old can we just buy 1 family pass? I think my 4 year old travels free. But our 12 year old can be included with us two adults in the family pass?    And if I got no passes how much is a bus ride that last like 6 to 8 mins only?    Thanks ,Carol,Perth,
I thought I posted this before but I don't see it - so I'll try again. We thoroughly enjoyed our two-week trip to Australia (early August) - and we want to return.    Some comments:    1. We started out and ended in Sydney. So much to do and not enough time. We walked around Potts Point (where we stayed) walked down through the Botanical garden visited the Art Museums and also the Australian Museum. Took a ferry to Manly. Of course saw the Opera House. I think next time we'll stay nearer Circular Quay (as was recommended to me on another thread) and explore other areas including by ferry. Never got to see the Rocks for example or made it to Bondi Beach.    2. We then flew to Uluru - which was the highlight of our trip. Uluru and Kaja-Tjuta were mesmerizing. The entire area so remote and with a sense of timelessness had it's own unique beauty. One night I slept outside in a swag and I was awestruck by the vibrant night sky (I come from an area with considerable light pollution). At one point a meteor shower occurred near the Southern Cross. Just priceless.    3. Then over to Cairns and up to a resort outside Port Douglas. This was a little bit of a letdown from Uluru. First the timing probably was not optimal for the Daintree. Next I was told to experience the real Daintree I needed to be about an hour's drive north. That said we still got to hike quite a bit including one long beach walk that required some scrambling over rocks. The best part was the morning we got up at sunrise walked to this nature area where wallabies were known to feed. Just sat there quietly and indeed a mob came out of the trees. We were the only people there. A mother with a curious joey in her pouch came up somewhat near us and both mom and joey checked us out. In the background we could see two wallabies engaged in a boxing match. Our room did have a good view towards the Coral Sea a view we grew to appreciate.    4. Some weird things from our domestic Australian flights. First Sydney to Uluru via Jetstar. We checked our bags and proceeded to wait in the gate area. In a short while these maniac Jetstar baggage Nazis came by and started checking bags for the Jetstar tag. If there were no tag they pounced with glee and weighed the bag and ended up fining some unhappy people. I was told some people would take stuff out of the bag and hide it passing the weight check and then put the items back into the bag before boarding.    From Uluru to Cairns we flew on I think Alliance Air? The plane was some Fokker 100 that actually still had ashtrays in the armrests although they were glued shut. The weird thing here is that the crew came around handing out water and boxes of... pizza? PIZZA? This was some sort of french bread pizza. A number of passengers were confused. I said no thanks as I did not trust it. I've flown probably 80-100 times in my life and never ever have seen pizza handed out as a snack on a low-cost airline. Nuts pretzels cookies etc. Pizza never.    From Cairns back to Sydney was Virgin Australia. Uneventful and boring. By then this was my 5th flight in just over about 10 days and I was thoroughly tired of flying.    5. Our last trip was to the Blue Mountains for a day tour. I was debating whether to go but I'm glad I did - the Blue Mountains was much more scenic and spectacular than I had expected. The downside was the hordes of Asian tourists arriving in seemingly endless tour buses. I'd like to go back but figure out how to get more off the beaten track.    Coming home it took a while for us to decompress but we are already starting to plot a return trip. A month later and we still have Australia on our minds as it was such a fantastic trip. ,BarkingSparrow,Sydney,Indianapolis...
my suitcase size and it's 62 inch (766030cm) ..the ticket says must be 60cm high x 70cm long x 50cm. How strict are they? It is going to be over 23kg  because I arrived to Australia from Europe with 26kg ish. Is there someone in front of the gate check everyone suitcase? Wil they reject me if i have these two that don't match the requirements? What if I go 30min earlier can I hop on train without passing through any train conductor ,Mae G,Sydney,

Hi All    I will be traveling to Australia for 2 weeks in November from 12 to 25th and after finding out that is the stinger season I am wondering if I should do Fiji (not in Australia I know) instead of Whitsundays.

My husband and I are planning a trip to Australia and one of our bucket list items is to see the Great Barrier Reef.    From what I understand it's massive and Cairns is one of the biggest locations for those that want to scuba/snorkel.    Are there any other locations that you find enjoyable other than Cairns? I keep getting Ads for Whitsundays. I will say we prefer the best scuba/snorkel but we also like great beaches and luxury resorts. ,J W,Cairns,"Chicago, Illinois"
My husband and I have done some research on Tasmania (ages 67 and 80). We thought it might be nice to go on a guided tour. Any recommendations for guided tours companies? Say for 7- 10 days? A private tour or small group tour? Of course we have seen many tours that do a circular tour including historic scenic wineries walks hikes and some wildlife.    We want to focus on the native wildlife of Tasmania and Australia. One area we thought we might focus on is the North and North West. Self-drive is a little intimidating but it is a possibility (we are from the States). We are all about the wildlife. We did contact Under Down Under Tours Tasmanian company but they do not do wildlife tours. Any suggestions would be much much appreciated. We have nothing against stopping at a winery brewery or distillery! Comfortable accommodations good food not luxury but a step up from hostels. We are fit for short hikes long hikes would be a challenge. Thank you! ,Sue,Tasmania,"Redmond, Oregon"
Hi  We are travelling to Melbourne in October (Yay!!). We want to rent a car to drive to Phillip island and then through GOR (and back to Melbourne).  While checking for car rentals East coast rentals is providing significantly lesser rates as compared to the bigger companies (e.g. Sixt).  Are they reliable or shall we stick to the known companies?      We plan to take the all inclusive package to avoid any excess.

Hi  Can i please check how I can train from perth city to Freemantle? I am so confused with the perth station and perth underground station. They are different? Not underground of the other?    We are going to stay near Elizabeth Quay station so guess we will start there.    What line and station should I be changing line at and to? .    How long will the journey take from Elizabeth Quay to freemantle train station?    How much per adult?    Is there child fare?  Possible to buy tickets using credit cards?      The train station is within walking distance from the freemantle jetty for us to take ferry to Rottnest island?    And any idea how much taxi from perth city to freemantle?    There are 4 of us. Does it make more sense to go with taxi than train?    Please help.    Thanks! ,Carol,Perth,
Hi    Exploring to buy tickets of the hop on and off bus for our mode of transport at Rottnest Island.    Not very keen to ride bikes due to our younger girls who will most likely find it tiring in a short while.    Anyone tried the hop on and off bus before?    Am I right to say there is only one hop on and off bus running on that island? As in one operator? This is the one with no narration but can get up and down easily anytime right?    Is the Australian Pinnacle Tour the right company for this Rottnest island hop onn& off bus? https://www.australianpinnacletours.com.au/western-australian-tours/rottnest-island-explorer    Just want to check before we purchase the tickets.    This bus will take us to the important places around Rottnest island right?    Thanks! ,Carol,Perth,

Hi    We're a family of 4 (two boys aged 10 and 8) who are flying into Perth in December. We'll be spending our first weekend in Fremantle before setting off on a 2 week road trip to Esperance Stirling Ranges Albany Denmark Pemberton and Margaret River. We'll be spending out last week (including Christmas) back in the Perth/Fremantle area where we'll be staying with friends. My wife is very keen to head up to Jurien Bay to swim with sea lions but accommodation is very scarce around the Christmas period or is only available for a minimum 2 night stay. However we don't really want to spend more than one night away due to other commitments in Perth/Fremantle.    So it looks like our only option is to take a day trip to Jurien Bay ‚Äì we will have the hire car for the duration of our stay. The sea lion operators usually have a very early morning trip (e.g. 06:45) and another at 09:30 or 10:00. Clearly if we're not staying overnight the early morning excursion is not an option but if we set off early (e.g. 06:00) from Fremantle we could make the 09:30/10:00 excursion. Does anyone know if the earlier excursions tend to have much better interaction with the sealions?    Assuming the excursion was to finish at 12:30 do you have any suggestions as to how we might spend the rest of our day? Was thinking the Pinnacles and Yanchep NP ‚Äì is that feasible? Or are there other options? Obviously we'd need to drive back to Fremantle and wouldn't want to be driving through the countryside when dark.

Would appreciate recommendations for 3-5 star hotels in Sydney where you can access your room via stairs. Unfortunately I have elevator phobia. Most hotels do not allow use of the stairs for security and fire reasons. The Radisson Blu Plaza for example has rooms on the 1st floor but will not allow you to use the stairs to get there. I am also open to Bed and Breakfast type if necessary. Thank you! ,Michelle B,,

I am finding conflicting info on this - if you have done online checkin for an international flight and have a boarding pass and do not have luggage to check in what do you actually have to do at airport? Can you go straight to immigration without needing to visit check in counter and actually speak to someone? The reason I ask is that we did exactly this at Perth airport a few years back on an SQ flight to Singapore but while boarding we were hailed over air asking for us to report to staff - they said we should have gone to checkin desk even though we had boarding pass and no checked luggage and indeed this was advised by SQ online. We were very embarrassed so I would like a definitive anwser if anyone knows please! I have posted this on Air Travel forum but was hoping someone actually knew recent procedure in Perth. ,LMCM111,Perth,"Perth, Australia"

In October I'll be finishing a 3-day tour around Uluru etc in Alice Springs and I need to get to Darwin. I'd prefer to see things along the way. There used to be backpacker (and other) tours on this route but they all seem to have been cancelled.    Would it be reasonable to drive myself perhaps taking 5 days or so and stopping off at Devil's Marbles Mataranka Katherine Gorge a couple of days for Kakudu NP?    Or will the first half of the journey (e.g. Alice Springs to Daly Waters) just be the same as I'll see with 3 days around Uluru meaning I might be better to fly/bus to Darwin and see Kakadu NP Katherine Gorge and maybe Mataranka from there?

Hi  We visited the area in late August 2023 and stayed at Chambers Wildlife lodge by Lake Eacham (thanks to tripadvisor area experts' recommendation for this lodge).    1. We saw Platypus many times like 5 times at Peterson's creek - be aware it can be confusing as two different areas (they both are part of the Peterson creek) have the board. So 3 times we showed up at the place thinking this is the place and under the bridge - it was hard to see clearly though you could spot Platypus). You need to go where the walking track is - there is a suspension bridge over the creek - you park and walk - it is a lovely walk. While we were in the area we went there for sunrise/sunset timings and spotted them. We only saw them clearly twice as we were originally going under the bridge (below the road - so it is confusing).  2. Staying at Chambers Wildlife was such a blessing. It is a lovely property and I wished I could have stayed there 3 nights but they were solid booked.  In the night both nights we saw Bandicoots. And one night we saw Sugar Gliders (and we saw them gliding from one tree to another) and striped possum. It was fantastic. Sometimes you just wait there for an hour as one animal will come and then another. ..    Looking for wildlife we went to Rosegum wilderness also one morning before 8 am but we did not see any wildlife there till 9:30 am ( except bush turkeys that are everywhere) I asked the guests there and they said that they have not seen anything the day before also. They do have some food out around 8ish in the morning to attract the wildlife.  They did had parrots because they feed the birds also - it was fun to see them.    We spent hours in the areas where Tree Kangaroos were seen recently and saw none .. though 2 people told us that they saw them in the past few days.  Hoping this will help other travelers especially if you are wildlife enthusiast like us. ,SVAA0814,Cairns,"Tampa, Florida"

Hi. We are thinking of having a winter trip in Hobart. Travelling with an 8 Yr old.  10 days. Thinking of some snow play. Chill drive. Not too stressful...  Any advise of itinerary is welcome.  We will be renting a car.  What are the must see and kids friendly.  A bit of hike is fine as well not sure if its ideal during winter. First time visiting Tazmania.  Appreciate it. ,Lina H,Tasmania,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi All  Before heading to GBR I researched a lot and was still not sure if I was able to snorkel or not. I did not know swimming (don't know much now either) but I can float - looking at the sky so I can breathe (that is in the pool not ocean). I also have a fear of jumping in the water where I can not stand so when I am floating I make sure I do not float away to the deep end. Even with the life west I was unable to let go of the boat handle in Maui and within 5 minutes back on the boat as you can't hang on to the boat in the ocean against the waves.    I was traveling to GBR with my sons - both good swimmers who were going for Scuba certifications. They joked that we will be looking down you will be looking at the sky if you do not learn swimming.  What I did to prepare myself this time ( I was committed to snorkel and see the GBR):  1. I spent $120 and bought myself a great recommended snorkel set almost a month before.  2. Every day even if I am not going to the pool I tried breathing from the snorkel - as it feels weird in the mouth and I had to adjust to it.  3. In the beginning I had to take out the snorkel and mask every few minutes but I got comfortable and could easily wear it for an hour or more.  4. At least 12 times I practiced in the pool - 4 times just in shallow end - floating (yep looking at the bottom of the pool this time still at the shallow end) and breathing through the snorkel.  5. Once I built enough confidence that I can breathe properly and for a bit long time using snorkel I was ready to test it in the deep end. It was scary .. but I had to do it.  6. My pool had a waist belt as floating device and pool noodles - so I took both (lol) in case one doesn't work. I practiced swimming in the deep end (length wise) as I got confident that I will not drown and I was able to keep my head down and breathe through my snorkel.  7. The last couple days of my practice I practiced jumping in the pool on the deep end .. it was hard to take that leap - but I knew if I can't do it here I can't do it in the ocean. I actually got a swim coach for 2 days and paid her $25 for 30 minutes (so a total of $50) to stand at the pool's end and tell me about my jump and how I can do better - I was scared and I needed that support that someone will save me immediately LOL  8. She also told me to take out my mask in the deep end of water and place it again - it later was useful as I had to do that several times when my mask leaked - so the money worth spending.  9. So even though I could not much swim in the water I was able to snorkel in the pool and do 4 laps without problems ( according to me that was a lot of progress in just a month for me). I also got used to of mask and snorkel.    And then we arrived in Cairns (Myself - the non swimmer with my equipment the boys - just like that). We went with Pro-Dive on a 3 day trip. There were only 1 other snorkeler ( a lady of my age from Sydney  she was an excellent swimmer and had gone on this boat several times as a diver when she was younger). I was able to jump in the ocean 8 times (no less pat on my back) in rainy somewhat chilly and windy weather with huge waves (4 times).    With the wet suit I didn't feel much cold and pro Dive boat gave me the noodle (they were aware that I will need that support). Other 25 or so travelers were divers.  It was an excellent experience and I was so happy with Pro Dive. They kept everyone well fed happy and safe.  On 2 occasions they were able to spare one employee who helped me with snorkeling -holding one end of the tube and pulled me against the waves - that was tremendous help as most of my energy was spent in just swimming against the waves and getting a bit closer to the reef.    I would definitely recommend snorkeling . even though it was a bit scary it was so worth it and I would go again if I have the opportunity.    When we came back to Cairns I found out that at least one of the days we were gone all snorkeling day tours were cancelled due to bad weather. Since we were already far away somewhere we were still able to do it. Two families that we met at different places were a bit sad that they will have to leave Aussie without this experience (they had kept 1 day for it but their tours were cancelled).    I am hoping this will help others who are in my boat - who are afraid/scared even in the pool who have never snorkeled before to take that leap of faith and do it. ,SVAA0814,Cairns,"Tampa, Florida"
From today ‚Äì 1 July 2023 ‚Äì parking fees in the Blue Mountains are increasing both in the areas they will apply to and their amount.    The increases are being applied by the Blue Mountains City Council (BMCC) to areas controlled by it for example Echo Point at Katoomba. They are not applicable to areas controlled and managed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) for example Narrow Neck Rd (which is closed anyway).    Stage 1    Throughout July smart parking (ie ticketless parking) is being rolled out in existing time restricted parking locations in town/village centres at Katoomba Blackheath Leura and Wentworth Falls. In addition and in response to complaints from locals smart parking is also being introduced in existing time restricted parking zones at Lincoln's Rock Wentworth Falls.    As part of Stage 1 an app will be launched. This will show real-time parking availability and take payments from visitors only. The pricing structure is being finalised. Visitors will be given the option to pay to park for 15 minutes one hour or daily at key locations and there will be peak and off-peak periods. For example until today anybody could park in designated spots along Katoomba St (the main drag) for free for up to 2 hours. By the end of July however visitors will have to pay for every 15 minutes of parking.    Us residents are being given 3 months to apply for and obtain our FREE parking permits (about bloody time).    Stage 2    It is expected that high demand visitation sites will also have smart parking facilities (including sensors and parking meters) operational from September 2023 to January 2024 once community consultation on the Parking Precincts Plan has been finalised and the plan reviewed and endorsed by the Council. These sites include:  ‚Ä¢ Cahill‚Äôs Lookout Katoomba  ‚Ä¢ Echo Point Precinct Katoomba (plus expansion of existing parking fee zones)  ‚Ä¢ Katoomba Falls  ‚Ä¢ Gordon Falls Leura  ‚Ä¢ Wentworth Falls Lake  ‚Ä¢ Falls Road adjacent to Wentworth Falls Lookout (Presumably this means the immediate area west of the Wentworth Falls picnic ground. It does not include the existing parking areas inside this area as that is controlled by the NPWS.)  ‚Ä¢ Fletcher Street and Valley Road adjacent to Conservation Hut Wentworth Falls  ‚Ä¢ Lincoln‚Äôs Rock Wentworth Falls (expansion of existing parking fee zones).    The BMCC has also decided to install smart parking facilities at Leura Cascades. This can only be a sick joke because the BMCC has kept Cliff Road and all vehicular access to Leura Cascades closed since early 2019 due to a landslide they can‚Äôt be bothered removing. The cost of re-opening Cliff Road at Leura Cascades has since increased exponentially because the bush has started to reclaim the closed road section. ,Pietr,Blue Mountains,"Katoomba, Australia"
Hi    We are staying two night in a hotel in Katoomba and then staying two nights in Sydney. We thought it would be easier to take the train from Katoomba staying two nights in Sydney city and come back on the train to Katoomba. My question is there any.overnight Parking at or near the train station in Katoomba. ,Virginia F,Katoomba,
Arriving in Sydney in late February 2024 and I wondered if there are bus/coach companies that  do tours longer than a day? We would like to go further afield than Sydney but would rather not have to hire a car as it means my husband spends the time driving not seeing the scenery. In the UK we have coach companies that will put on say a 5 day trip to Scotland and organise the accommodation and itinerary. Any company in Sydney which does similar?  Thank you. ,PebblesBob,Sydney,Westward Ho...

Apologies in advance if im oiling a squeaky wheel here ive trawled through and then become overwhelmed finding the right info ‚Äòfor me‚Äô.  We are travelling around tas next month with our two younger boys 5yrs and 7yrs.  We have 3 weeks and im having trouble working out how to spend our final 5 days.  We are looking for different unique-ish experiences but also not too full on for the kids as they are prone to whining when having to walk too long (sigh!)    Itinerary so far:  Hobart 5 nights  Launceston 6 nights (staying with family so some local down time and day trips)  Cradle Mountain (Sheffield) 2 nights    ‚Ä¶and then we have 5 nights to make our way back to Hobart back via the East Coast to fly home this may be too long or short to some readers but im also mindful that it will be cold so not exactly beach hang weather!    Im thinking  St helens  Freycinet/coles Bay area  Port Arthur    I guess im looking for any specific recommendations for activities/locations/accomodations - aswell as suggested amount of time in each place  Im looking forward to your comments :)    Thank you in advance ,marshallsmum,Tasmania,"Perth, Australia"
I'm an Australian citizen which means I qualify for ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) and VWP (Visa Waiver Program). So I booked my flights only to find out I need to apply for C1 Transit visa (only transiting - not leaving the airport at LAX) because part of my holiday prior to transiting the USA is going to Cuba which disqualifies eligibility for ESTA.  I've had to fill in a lengthy DS-160 form pay AUD$295 and now need to book an interview with the US embassy in Melbourne. If I knew this was the process and cost I would not have gone through the USA but my flights are non-refundable. My biggest worry is that interviews at the Melbourne embassy are booked out 2 months ahead and I'm leaving in 3 weeks' time. The US government website says there are only a few days to wait for C transit visa interviews but the booking portal (http://ustraveldocs.com) shows different. Has anyone else had a similar dilemma and how did you get it resolved?

Hi Everyone    My wife has always wanted to visit an oyster farm and I was wondering if any of you know what is the nearest oyster farm to Melbourne?    I could only find those near Adelaide and Sydney but we will not be there. We can only travel max 5h by car as we'll be with a small baby.    If really don't have maybe one of those places where you can catch your own fish/seafood and then eat it. I saw the Cripps Family fish farm but it seems to be closed.    Thank you! ,Michal N,Melbourne,Singapore
Hi Friends  I thought smart to just asks this as a separate post - we are staying 5 nights (Mid February 2024) at the Marriott CQ. We want one day to visit the BM. We want to do scenic world and a hike to see 3 Sisters.    Would you suggest:  A: Train and do it yourself  B: Rent a car (don't want to get frustrated and lost)  C: Take a tour that includes these things. (I've seen some that include things we don't need such as a meal - just as happy to bring sandwiches..........)    We arrive in Sydney on a Thursday for 5 nights if a day of the week matters.    THANKS!  Ellen ,Ellen L,,Philadelphia...
When I went to Switzerland there was a Swiss Travel Pass which includes bus train ferries and several attractions so I can easily hop on and off without worrying about getting a transportation card and figuring out how much to pay. Is there something similar for Australia? I was trying to research but it seems like there are some free buses but then some for a fee and then the fees vary and all the cards differ per city.    I'm a solo traveler and I don't like those big tours across the country so I was planning to do some things on my own and others with a day tour. Several posts have said public transportation is so easy in Australia so should I do them all on my own or still do the day tour? The day tours I was planning are: Blue Mountains Hunter Valley Great Barrier Reef Daintree Rainforest Yarra Valley Great Ocean Road and Philip Island for the penguin parade.    If I keep these day tours is it better to pay for public transportation as pay as I go or it'll still be more cost effective to get a day or weekly pass?    I have a credit card with no foreign transaction fees but while I was booking my hotels I noticed that there are places in Australia with a credit card surcharge fee. Are credit card surcharge fees common in Australia? I'm trying to plan how much cash I should bring.    Thank you for your advice! ,Teresa,,
We're traveling from WA towing a 24' caravan with our 2 toy poodles. We've lucked out and due overstaying and a breakdown costing us over a week we're going to hit the Great ocean road on the beginning weekend of the October school holidays. We don't have the time to delay any further to start the leg at a later date this trip. So our questions are what it's like to get caravan park accomodation or free camping options on the trip for this period. Comming from Ballarat we're looking at getting a stopping option close to the start of the great ocean road with 1 or 2 stopping options along the length. Than ks for any responses. ,Adrian S,Great Ocean Road,
Iv just spent a few days in Napa Valley California. With not really thinking I brought a case of wine. The winery offered to ship it home but that was going to cost more than the wine itself. So my question is can I bring this back into Australia within my checked bagged if I declare the wine being 12 bottles ?  TIA ,Lauren,,"Esperance, Australia"
Hi! I know there is supposed to be a no-tipping culture but there seem to be some exceptions.  Do we tip an Uber driver? I understand people round up for taxis. If so do we do it in the app?  Do we tip people delivering food we order? For instance if we have food delivered from Banjo‚Äôs do we tip and in cash or on the app?  Thank you! ,Koalatravelor,,"Westchester, New..."
Hi all    We're heading to Queensland in February for a month or so from the UK.    I love going to hotels in Europe and West Indies that have a range of sailing dinghies available for residents to self-sail. Usually there's a guy in an inflatable too ensuring that inept guests don't end up over the horizon. Hobie cats Lasers Toppers that sort of thing.    For some reason I can't find a way to search on Queensland hotels that have this sort of thing. I cannot believe with the warms waters etc that they wouldn't exist?    Can someone put me out of my misery? Not bothered with bling/luxury. Just a few names of resorts/hotels that have simple boats to self-sail ideally in a monitored water area.    thanks in advance!

Hi everyone    I am in the early stages of planning a 2025 trip to Australia. I am planning early because I want to be prepared to book certain trip components as soon as they are available and because I am going to attempt to travel hack our way to free airfare.    The background on us is that we are a family of 3. In 2025 my husband and I will still be in our 40s and our son will be 12. We enjoy the outdoors and wildlife history culture and tasty food. We do all have a fear of heights. We have done things like canopy towers to observe wildlife. But things that are high for the sake of being high (ferris wheels gondolas over canyons) are not something fun for us.    The trip will take place in July and/or August 2025. We are somewhat flexible about how long the trip can be. I am aiming for somewhere between 2 and 3 weeks but we can add or subtract a few days as needed. 2025 is the husband's and my 20th anniversary so we have set a pretty generous budget. I am aiming for the non-airfare portion of the trip to come in under $15000 USD/$23500 AUD.    With that context I hoped you could provide any general feedback on our itinerary answer the specific questions I have posted and comment on where we might find good wildlife viewing options. My son wants to see wallabies wombats any marsupials really. We'll do the zoo in Sydney but he really loves seeing animals in the wild.    1. Arrive in Syndey - spent 4 or 5 nights. Is there a day trip from Syndey that you would recommend for winter travelers? Or would it be better to spend all the time in the city? It seems like there is a lot to do.  2. Fly to Yularu. (We are flexible on trip start dates so will time Sydney portion so that we can leave on a day where flights are offered). 3 nights at Ayers Rock Resort.  3. Transfer to Alice Springs. We are going to Alice to catch the Ghan north to Darwin. But it does seem like there are some worthwhile things to do in the Alice area. Should we add in some time here? (at least 1 night)  4. Ghan to Darwin. (1 night)  5. Darwin. I'm not sure how many nights to spend in Darwin. There seem to be some worthwhile things to do in the city and we may be able to time our arrival to the dates for the Darwin festival. There is also the opportunity for day trips from here.  6. 3 or 4 night tour to Kakadu. My hope is to be able to do this with a private tour company but I haven't gotten quotes yet to see if it is in the budget.  7. Return to Darwin and fly home. May need to stay a night in Darwin before flight.    Thanks in advance for any feedback! ,Jess_S_10000000,,Boston...
Staying for 5 days with a 11 yr old kid.  Marriott gold member so biased towards marriott hotels.    1) Should I go for Westin- Is metro noise still there? is it only at day or during night too?  2) Ritz carlton- is it a buffet breakfast? I can't find this info on net.  3) Is Sheraton good enough? ,Health F,Melbourne,
This is to help others who may have similar concern.  We were at Cairns Airport in late August 2023.    Our flight got delayed and we arrived at the airport quite late perhaps around 11 PM. it was raining also. There was a long line (15 or so people ahead of us) for the taxi but the taxis were coming constantly (so they must be able to communicate to others that there are still passengers waiting). The line was moving fast. We had no issues at all.    I saw some people going for Uber also but with the luggage (and we were exhausted) we just stood in the taxi line rather than walking a short distance in the rain to catch uber.  So no worries for the late flights. ,SVAA0814,Cairns,"Tampa, Florida"
Is Westin at Collins street still impacted by metro construction noise? ,Health F,Melbourne,
Hi  This is my personal opinion based on our 2 hour guided trip in August 2023. Your expectation and experience might be different than mine    Our Group - Three adults myself and two sons ( Both very knowledgeable about environmental science trees animals and stuff one of them is majoring in environmental science with many classes in climate change and policy etc ). We read 80% of the informational boards (or take pictures and read it later) when we are traveling. We are not average travelers - the whole plane journey is spent in reading about the place we are about to visit.    Before we did this tour we had been in the region for couple days already and had at least superficial knowledge about many trees vines plants etc. We had spent 3 hours at Daintree Discovery Centre (and perhaps could have spent another 3 if time was not a factor) as you can learn a lot there on your own pace.  We had also done the Free Botanic Garden walk in Sydney and had learnt a lot about flora/fauna there also.    1. The Cooper Creek Wilderness walk is expensive and a group of I believe 10 of us took the 2 hour walk with Ms. Angie.  2. If you are interested in learning a lot about rainforests and trees etc. it is worth it - if you are an average Joe then you will not remember much of this information after few hours.  3. None of us were from Australia so emphasis on Australian politics about Pigs and how it is impacting the other wildlife does not make sense - there is Nothing we can do - shaming the local govt with tourists is Ok but fruitless. All 3 of us are very aware of politics and I feel that if someone is quite passionate about something they should do something to nudge/force the Govt. to make better decision. Get with your neighbors your city/county people and petition - that will help solve the problem tourists can not solve this problem.  4. We did see couple of spiders and learnt few new things but because we had already read plenty of informational signposts in the area (why trees have buttress - she discussed 2 reasonings out of the 3 we had read about about strangling fig trees about the stinging trees - I read the notice by Wallacha falls and it prompted me to wear my jacket)  it was not new information for me.  5. We had already done many interesting trails so the trail itself was just OK for us.  6. This was not a time for any fruits/flowers but in the season I am sure there must be many flowers/ fruits and the walk might be more interesting.  7. Both my kids learnt few new things. I asked them individually and they said $30 or $35 might be the fair value for a group of 10 for this trip. For $80 it is quite expensive and not worth it.  8. What we understood that their family makes money only by giving these tours OR by selling the book so I understand why the prices are high - but none of us thought that the tour should be that expensive.  9. We had seen fan palms and giant trees on the walks in the area - so I was not awestruck by the majesty or grandeur of what we saw on this track.  Quite often when I am in nature I feel the quietness the ancient trees - something inside you that makes you stop in your track and soak it in - that did not happen to me perhaps because it was a tour and so we were moving at a pace and of course we were talking.    10. What I liked - we saw a Cassowary and a chick (for few minutes).. that was my highlight .. it was close to the car parking. Before that we had seen one Cassowary by the discovery center but no chick.    Will I do it again knowing what I know now - Not for $80 per person. Yes for $30 or $35 per person.  For this much money I was thinking they should offer water juice coffee/tea and some snack/cookies after the tour was over (Knowing my kids will not eat anything .. but that would be nice for the travelers).  I agree with Ms. Angie that Govt should do better to protect the native wildlife. ,SVAA0814,Cairns,"Tampa, Florida"

I'm looking to travel to Sydney Cairns & Melbourne in December and keep reading about how this is the worst time to visit the reef. What I'm not clear on is whether this means not ideal or don't even bother because it's terrible! I don't mind the heat if I'm by the ocean. I do want to see amazing sea life even if it is not the very best month for viewing... am I wrong in assuming that you will see beautiful marine life year round at the GBR? I hear it's rainy but does this mean storms each day that give way to sun (like Florida or the Caribbean) or that your trip gets rained out and all activities cancelled? I've read about the stingers but is it routine for dive outfits to provide suits as part of their service? Are you literally not allowed to go in the water at the beach or do some beaches or resorts have areas that are safe and it is permitted? Thank you in advance for putting it in perspective! ,C@mpS@mpson,,
Hi All  This is to provide you all some feedback so you can plan accordingly. This is my personal opinion based on my recent experience from late August 2023:    We drove the Bloomfield track in an SUV in 2021 MGHS.on August 30th from south to North.  For our party of 3 it was wasted time - the track is OK (no outstanding beauty - nature/wildlife). It has some creek crossing unpaved roads a rocky terrain some construction etc.  Now it depends upon your perspective (what you have done in the past). We had more exciting driving adventures in USA (where I live now for many decades) and back in India (where I grew up).    All 3 of us were laughing that it is over after we reached the falls (Wujal Wujal - north end of the track and you can go there from Cooktown without going to Bloomfield track).  The fall was good but then again if you have recently seen spectacular falls then you can miss it.  I liked that we were the only ones on the falls and just the slight remoteness of the fall and the waterflow is good. If you are in the area it is good to visit - however it is not worth it if you are spending 3 hours or more to see this fall.    Bloomfield Track - Creek crossings: Only the first creek Emmagen Creek had somewhat deep water rest of the creeks were very shallow when we visited.    The Rockiness - If you have driven in remote places in Utah or Arizona to see Slot Canyons then you have seen/experienced better than this route.    Scenery - there is not much scenery in this route that you do not see elsewhere. We had driven the Great Ocean Road before so it was rather underwhelming.    We left at 6 in the AM and came back midnight - went till cooktown and even further a bit to see sand colors and I think 80% of this particular day was sort of wasted for us. Looking back we should have NOT gone on this track and rather spent our day somewhere else.    Only reason I am writing this as I had heard a lot about this track and was extremely keen to see what it is all about - after seeing it I call it marketing.  Hope this helps some of you in making the decision to Drive or Not drive. ,SVAA0814,Cairns Region,"Tampa, Florida"

Hello experts    We are a family of 4 adults (including my senior parents) and 2 boys aged 6 and 9 from Singapore. We will be in melbourne from 17thNov - 24Nov. Here is rough itinerary and would like to get your thoughts if its feasible :)  I'm keen to check out the city's vibrant cafe culture and good food! Am also excited on the GOR road trip to experience beautiful coastal scenery forest hikes and hope to see native animals in the wild. Would also love the chance to visit a good vineyard but seems they are all located in eastern side of Melbourne. My parents enjoy hiking amidst cool weather and natural scenery which we don't get in our home country. The boys love playing sand on the beach and seeing animals in the wild.    I have not really organised the city itinerary but listed places we might be interested to visit.    day 1 Fri (17Nov 6am plus arrival) :  Staying at Ibis Central  Melbourne CBD area : Melbourne museum Fed square Degraves st Hardware lane flinders lane Hosier lane Victoria state library    day2 Sat:  morning - early afternoon : Puffing billy daytrip (Belgrave to Lakeside) via train  Explore rest of CBD sights not covered yet    day 3 Sun:  Breakfast QVM (read that its most lively on Sun?)  Melbourne Zoo (read that free entry for kids does it apply for foreigners )    day 4 Mon (stay apollo bay):  Collect rental car at Southern Melbourne at 10am  Drive to Torquay and shop at surf wear outlets  Lunch at Torquay  Stop at Bells beach to take pictures maybe a short walk around  Great ocean road chocolaterie for hot chocolate  Split point lighthouse to climb lighthouse and see coastal scenery  Erskine falls (might skip if not enough time since planning to go Hopetoun falls another day)  Teddy's look-out  Dinner at Apollo Bay restaurant  Check into Big4 pisces apollo bay.    day 5 Tues (stay apollo bay):  morning : Maits Rainforest reserve boardwalk  lunch at Apollo bay fisherman co-op  afternoon : Is there a nice beach in apollo bay area or nearby where kids can play sand and adults can have a picnic?  Mariner's lookout for sunset  Dinner at apollo bay restaurant    day 6 Wed (stay Port Campbell):  Cape Otway road to spot Koalas not going lighthouse.  Otways California redwoods  Hopetoun falls  Gibsons steps  12 apostles  London bridge to see penguins at sunset  Check in Loch Ard Motor Inn  Dinner at Port Campbell or nearby restaurant    day 7 Thurs (stay Port Campbell):  morning: Loch ard Gorge Arch Grotto.  Lunch at Warrnambol or nearby between 12 apostles and Towerhill Sanctuary  afternoon: Towerhill Sanctuary for hiking    day 8 Fri:  Drive coastal road to Melbourne airport for departure flight at 4.55pm.    Besides the questions asked above i wonder if i should spend the last night in Halls Gap /Grampians instead so there is a better chance to see kangaroos in the wild and hike there instead of Towerhill sanctuary. So i should finish all coastal formation attractions on day 6 and early day 7 drive to Halls Gap/ Grampians for a hike and stay for the night.    For the inland drive back from Halls Gap / Port Campbell to Melbourne airport is there a place to stop by for lunch or a break midway? Better if there is also a mall/K-Mart/Targets for last minute shopping too.    Thanks for the advice! ,afro_ken,Melbourne,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hello Mates!  Planning a 3 month semi Big Lap in 2025 from the US. Have spent a lot of time in coastal FNQ the GBR and the Brisbane area already‚Ä¶We are planning on buying a used 4WD SUV for the trip and renting or buying a camping trailer.    Is theSavannah Way from Burketown to Borroloola similar enough to the Gibb to just do one or the other? I see a limited number of severely corrugated roads in our future. Would you do both anyway?    We‚Äôd do the Gibb from Kununurra to Derby or Highway One not both. Is that a mistake?    We are definitely going to Karijini. Just trying to balance all the different types of scenery within the 6 weeks we are allotting from Brisbane to Perth.    I‚Äôm figuring the second 6 weeks will be Perth to Brisbane not needing any time for Tassie(will do that another trip)  the Red Center or the coast between Brisbane and Port MacQuarie.  Thanks. I‚Äôll be slowly building my itinerary based on your expert advice! ,SnowyandSniggles,,Canandaigua
I was looking forward to staying in a hostel at Melbourne as my friends had shared positive reviews about it. However when i read about the reviews of the Hostels in Melbourne it seems like quite a large number of hostels over at Melbourne seem to have bed bug issues :(    Wondering if anyone has any advice for how to choose a clean hostel? ,mrandmrsteo,,"Singapore, Singapore"
We are on a cruise in Feb 2023 that docks in Brisbane  none of the Ships excursions are of interest to us and we've been to Brisbane before    looking at the map the cruise terminal looks to be near the Airport?  and the DFO shopping center appears to only be about 10-15 minutes from the cruise terminal  does anyone know if this is correct? and and would it be easy to get a uber from the cruise terminal to the DFO and back again?    thanks in advance ,Nick in NZ,Brisbane,"North Shore, New..."
Hi all  I saw quite a few taxi booking sites in Melbourne like 13cabs silver tops Crown cabs etc. Are there any one which should be avoided or they are all generally safe to book? I believe booster seat are not required for a 6 years if we uses these taxi? ,WishesT,Victoria,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hey I got a speeding ticket at 21 May. But I never received my speeding ticket over email or telephone number. I was living with a host family and was driving their car and I got a on spot fine. The host family never sent me the find that came by and letter. So now it is overdue but I want you to give them a statement of declaration so I could maybe come out of the fine. I don‚Äôt know if I should pay the fine or not and I would like to know if somebody had issues traveling out of Australia or getting in again also does anyone knows if a speeding ticket in Queensland can expire because if it expires in five years and I could come back in five years and everything is OK. And I don‚Äôt have to worry. They don‚Äôt have my passport but they have my normal German drivers license. What should I do now I was thinking about calling them because I NF never received the fine until now but I have only received it because I asked Miles family if I had any more lettuce coming into the address so now my fine is overdue. ,nele s,Queensland,
Hey all! So I'm finishing high school this year and I've decided instead of going to schoolies and just getting pointlessly hammered for a week straight I'd rather spend the time with my dad doing something that I'll actually cherish for life. The trip will be a week long and we will be going to either Canberra around QLD (preferably avoiding the sunny or Gold Coast as this is traditionally where schoolies is held) or somewhere in NSW.  Here's a list of activities we'd like to do and other notable things while we are there. (I know we likely won't tick all these boxes but I'd still love to get a lot of them covered.) Mountain biking (This is the big one and definitely a must have activity for us. We'd love to go to a good mountain bike park and have fun on some downhill trails.) light hiking free entry festivals perhaps some urban exploring too...? seeing some amazing views being around people (another must have) and whatever other activities you guys think would be perfect for us to do.  Now the fact of the matter is that currently no reservations have been made and since we will be there in November... let's just say I know our bookings should have already been completed by now. Unfortunately as many grand plans and ideas that I have I can't seem to land any definite plans. We will be driving down so no need for flights but info such as locations names of hotels bike rental companies and any other tour operators planning or relevant info would help so much. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks to you all! ,Lucas,New South Wales,"Ipswich, Australia"
We Will be there in October and are wanting to visit both whitehaven beach and visit Hamilton island too. Is it worthwhile spending  one day at each location?    or is half day visit to Whitehaven and half day visit to Hamilton island enough ?

I don‚Äôt want to move there if every noise I hear at night freaks me out wondering .please can I get some advice on where are the safest suburbs to live and is the a huge police presence in Darwin to help with this problem. ,wildfig,Darwin,Rockingham...

Hello everyone!    My husband and I will be visiting Australia for the first time this mid October. We'll have 14.5 days in Australia (already exclude flights into Melbourne and out from Sydney). We love nature first food (but watch our sugar) and learning about local life. Below is our rough itinerary so far.    Day 0 Depart to Melbourne  Day 1 - Melbourne - Queen Victoria Market & downtown (laneways)  Day 2 - Melbourne - NGV Fed Square maybe South Melbourne  Day 3 - Melbourne - GOR stay at Apollo Bay  Day 4 - Melbourne - Port Campbell stay in Halls Gap  Day 5 - Melbourne - Grampians stay in Halls Gap  Day 6 - Melbourne/Tasmania - Return to Melbourne fly to Hobart  Day 7 - Tasmania - Hobart MONA  Day 8 - Tasmania - Salamanca market stay in Freycinet  Day 9 - Tasmania - Freycinet Wineglass Bay  Day 10 - Sydney - Launceston stay in Launceston  Day 11 - Sydney - Drive to Cradle Mountain  Day 12 - Sydney - Cradle Mountain  Day 13 - Sydney - Return to Launceston fly to Sydney  Day 14 - Sydney - Royal Botanic Garden Sydney downtown  Day 15 Return to Jakarta    My questions:  - Considering the season and the amount of time is it better to do the above Melbourne-Tasmania or is Melbourne-Sydney better?  - Do the above destination choices already make the most of our limited time in the respective areas? Or are there destinations that are not that awesome and should be dropped/replaced to make this trip less rushed/more enjoyable?  - Is it very difficult to drive in and out Cradle Mountain to Launceston in Spring? Previously I've heard that in winter the road may often be closed. I hope to catch a flight to Sydney on the day we exit Cradle Mountain.    Your feedback are greatly appreciated! ,StElle,,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Spent 2 nights in Cairns and a week in PD. Had been before so not as interested in all the touristy sights this time more a relaxing holiday.  The one thing I was worried about before going was all the talk about booking restaurants. Yes if you have a specific place in mind then a good idea to book for some certainty. However there are SO many restaurants and as long as you're fairly easy going then there are a huge number of choices!! We booked a couple of places (Yacht club and Surfy) but honestly we didn't need to. Lots of empty tables with people walking in and being seated straight away. (We were there between 6-9pm so not super early or late)  Ate at the Court house (great Barramundi) Central Hotel (excellent pizza) and the other 2 above. Also ate on the balcony of our apartment a few nights courtesy of Coles supermarket ! So to everyone worried about reservations just go when you're ready and if you can't get a table head next door - there's always something available.  We also went to the Low Isles with Wavedancer. While it's a great trip I would recommend you check the tides before booking. We were at the island at low tide and it was not ideal. Coral above the water and very poor snorkeling. Hard to even swim off the island as the water was very shallow. Still a nice trip but if you have the option of waiting for a day when the tide will be higher while you're out there then so much the better. ,Shoesandhandbags,Port Douglas,"Christchurch, New..."
so i want to go in a month i have a visa but did not book anything yet so i might be cutting it close. I'll be coming from Bali. I don't know the order of the trip yet since that will depend on flights and prices. Here are the segments I'd like to do let me know if it's possible:    Sydney  day 1 arrive in sydney (flight from somewhere)  day 2 sydney  day 3 sydney  day 4 sydney to blue mountains (katoomba take early train)  day 5 blue mountains to sydney  day 6 leave sydney (flight to somewhere)    Cairns  day 1 arrive in cairns (flight from somewhere)  day 2 cairns - atherton tablelands  day 3 cairns - GBR day trip  day 4 cairns - Daintree  day 5 cairns - kuranda  day 6 leave cairns    Uluru  day 1 arrive in uluru  day 2 kings canyon day trip  day 3 kata tjuta sunrise (using hop on hop off)/uluru sunset  day 4 leave uluru    Melbourne  day 1 arrive in melbourne  day 2 melbourne  day 3 melbourne  day 4 phillips island day trip  day 5 day 1 of 3 day GOR /grampians tour  day 6 day 2 of tour  day 7 day 3 of tour  day 8 leave melbourne    Tasmania  day 1 arrive in Hobart  8 full days in tasmania  day 10 leave hobart    altogether the days above add up to 30 days (if you add the days listed it's 34 but note that the arrival day on one region is the same day as the departure day of another region.    How does this look overall?  1. GIven how i'm coming from Bali how do you suggest organizing the itinerary (what region to do first second etc)  2. I was thinking of including Darwin area also either by removing Tasmania or finding things to cut (for instance i could cut the 3 day GOR tour Daintree and atherton tablelands a day or two from tasmania and that could give me 4-5 full days in Darwin to do a tour to kakadu and a day at litchfield). Is October a good time to even consider such a move? I know it's the buildup    Any advice is appreciated. It's my first time in Australia and it might be my only time since I live in US. Budget wise I am fine with splurging since I may not be back so let's ignore that aspect for now.    Any help is appreciated i want to buy flights within the next couple of days (as I said I'm already cutting it short since i want to be there in a month. ,dayexday,,

Hi.    I‚Äôm trying to pin down my timing.    I will be in Warrnambool mid March 2024 and plan to take the train into Melbourne then catch the SkyBus to the domestic airport. There are lots of flights to Sydney so I know I can choose a later one in the day.    Any idea on whether the line upgrades will be done by March so I don‚Äôt have to factor in the shuttle/train from Geelong? The PTV website only shows disruption dates for three upcoming months.    I‚Äôm just trying to limit the wait time at the airport but would like to get your recommendations.    Thanks! ,Janlyn-60,Melbourne,"Toronto, Canada"
Hello my wife and I will be taking a Carnival Cruise in November. Two of our stops will be in Cairns and Port Douglas. I have yet to see any great dive excursions from the Carnival website. Has anyone had experience in booking a dive company from either of these two ports? Due to time constraints we are just looking for a two-tank dive.    I appreciate any help you can provide. ,Michael C,Cairns,"Phoenix, Arizona"
I'm traveling for the first time in November and would like advice on my itinerary. Sydney 4 days. Tasmania/Hobart 5 days. Melbourne 4 days. Cairns/Great Barrier Reef 3 days. 5 days Auckland/North Island and 5 days Queenstown/South Island. I could possibly substitute Uluru for the Great Barrier Reef. I'm aware it's a fair amount of flying but my travel style is that I do like to move around. I like natural wonders good food city life and snorkeling. I will probably be traveling alone. Does this seem doable or would you have other suggestions? Help greatly appreciated. ,M G,,San Francisco...

Hi all  This is to help fellow travelers. This is based on my personal experience from late August 2023 when I drove GOR. My opinion is NOT to offend anyone and I understand that people will disagree with my opinion.    I am compelled to write this as when I was planning the trip I was trying to figure out whether I should drive GOR and if Yes how many days for GOR  some of the comparative reviews gave me perspective on what to expect. I think it is only fair to write my feedback in the hope that it helps fellow travelers.    Background - I have traveled many many times on Hwy 1 in California often staying overnight at San Luis Obispo or other small towns on the way. My most recent drive was in March 2022. I have driven Road to Hana two decades ago and I thought it was simply out of this world (but then I had traveled less than what I had traveled now) still when we drove the Road to Hana the second time in Dec 2021 ( we actually stayed in Hana for few days ) it was again simply amazing (so many small and big waterfalls the rainbows starting and ending in ocean flowers greenery ..to drive the small section of the road took us many many hours despite not much traffic because you would want to stop at every corner. This small portion of the road rivals to and at times exceed many drives in Kawaii.  So in essence I had driven both routes rather recently and had liked them. I decided to spend few days on GOR (my first decision point). After reading many reviews I understood one thing - people who have done route 1 (generally speaking) didn't like the GOR as much because they tried to cover GOR in one or two days. Most people liked this route when they had spent at least 3 days. This was the tale end of winter and we knew it could rain so we built some time (mental note ) for that.    For me 4 nights were good - we stayed at Lorne Close to Cape Otway Lighthouse Port Campbell and Warrnambool.    1. For us it was worth it. All 3 of us thought that both Hwy 1 and Road to Hana offer a different experience and they aall are worth doing it for their own reasons.  2. The GOR had lighthouses and history and Koalas (did I mention we love seeing wild animals in the wild - as long as we are safe lol) . It also had Roos Wallabies and Glow worms. The views were fantastic.  3. The rock formations - I know the coast from Portland to Seattle has the beautiful rock formations also ( I have lived in Portland) - they were still worth it for us to see. We were there last visitors in the evening and first visitors in the morning to see the sunrise.  4. I liked the little towns they had character. If my memory is right Port Campbell has one small grocery store with post office in the same store. We went late evening to buy the bread and there were only 2 kind of bread in the store (we are NOT foodies and spend most time sightseeing rather than looking for food) and very limited fresh food selection (we were there close to closing time and it was not a big deal to us - we make do for food).  5. We did NOT had time to do Lorne Wire park or any other paid thing on this route - there was enough Free things to do . Granted we spend time looking for Koalas in the areas we were expecting them and we found many - which was so fun. We spend time watching mob of Roos in the AM - and also in the late evening.  There is not much wildlife (different animals for us) on Hwy 1 or Road to Hana. We also saw few colorful parrots and some other birds. You can hear the birds but you can't generally see them.  6. We did see I believe 2 or 3 waterfalls and even when the waterfalls itself were not as spectacular as Yosemite (I was there in June 2023 and that was simply amazing) the paths were so lush green so beautiful.  7. Before even we reached Logan Beach and Warrnambool we were aware that the whale season is messed up (we asked in Lorne and and Cape Otway) - there were no whales and locals had seen only 2 whales so far which is not the case usually.  8. We did go to Tower Hill preserve and were lucky to see Emu and Echidna there (my kids are very good in spotting things) along with couple of Roos and wallabies.  9. We went to Melba Gully around 5 PM and get the lay of the land and then waited in the car there itself till 9 PM or so when it was pitch black and then walked again to see the Glow worms.  10. We saw both lighthouses and liked it. We had stayed at Bimbi and bought the Cape Otway lighthouse ticket from Bimbi and it was slightly cheaper. We loved our stay at Bimbi - we looked and found 4 Koalas on the property. We saw few interesting birds on the property also.    I was glad that we had spent 4 nights on this route which gave us 3.5 days out of which 1 day was drizzling off and on and so Lorne wire park was closed.    My opinion - spend at least 3 full days and 2 nights to feel / experience the route. We had 3.5 full days and 4 nights (because of bad weather and because I know we like to read/learn every thing and spend time in looking for wildlife). ,SVAA0814,Melbourne,"Tampa, Florida"

I have been lurking here for a while and noting down a few ideas and tips. I need to crack on and start booking car hire and accommodations though. Would welcome your input!    We are a couple 70 and 65. My hiking days are over due to an arthritic knee but otherwise active. We are not looking to tick attractions off - we want to get a ‚Äòfeel of the area‚Äô and are often happy to just sit and take in the atmosphere over a coffee. Having said that we have done road trips in NZ up the west coast of Australia and the Garden Route in SA. I have checked driving distances between the towns mentioned below and they don‚Äôt seem too onerous. We love good food and wine. I realise Halls Gap is a hiking destination but am happy to sit with a view and a book while the Other Half hikes. I have put in 3 days at Apollo bay because we want a couple of days by the ocean.  We will be coming from HK where we have a 3 day stop over from the UK. We arrive very late night. Overnight Radisson Flagstaff for 4 nights pre booked (although I think this is one night too many; not sure if I can change this). Here goes -    Day 1 - recovery/orientation/coffee/sky deck?  Day 2 - day trip on the train to Geelong  Day 3 - prison goal/ and or possibly food tour  Day 5 - check out. pick up hire car. Drive Apollo bay. Overnight  Day 6 - Apollo Bay  Day 7 - Apollo bay  Day 8 - check out & drive Warranambool -  Day 9 - Warranambool  Day 10 - check out drive Halls gap (looking at Halls Gap log cabins)  Day 11 - Halls gap  Day 12 - Halls gap  Day 13 - check out & drive Ballarat  Day 14 - check out. & drive Mornington Peninsula  Day 15 - Mornington Peninsula  Dat 16 - check out - return car late afternoon. Overnight Radisson (pre-booked)  Day 17 - check out - afternoon flight home    I would welcome feedback on the itinerary first then any suggestions for mid range accommodation and great places to eat along the way. I have picked stays at the particular towns based on advice here and what we would like to see. (Can give more detail).    Thank you in advance for your time. ,Navybluebiplane,Melbourne,"Lichfield, United..."

Looking ahead to a one way road trip next June up the Queensland coast. Was planning to fly from US to Brisbane and go from there. But I am now thinking of flying to Sydney instead enjoy city for a couple of days in winter when it's more quiet then flying up to the Sunshine Coast airport skipping Brisbane hiring a car and starting from there. Does this raise any logistical or other red flags for people in the know other than missing out on Brisbane in order to see Sydney? ,Mypeeps,,"Majorca, Spain"

Hi everyone I've posted a similar post but I would like to know if anyone could give me an advice as what to skip between these areas. It will be our first trip in Australia though we are experienced independent travellers.    The Kimberleys (possibly with top end) . Gibb river Road the Bungles and Cape Leveque included.    The Red Centre (loop with the Mac Donnelly included)    Western Australia from Perth to Ningaloo Reef and Karinji NP.(loop)    Of course we would like to see them all but the fees would really go beyond what we can afford.  I've done lots of researches about transportation so I know what to expect. My question is rather what places we should keep and the one we could keep.  We love wild nature and red landscapes....

Hi all    I received a speeding conviction in the UK a couple years ago where I pled guilty via post and received points on my licence and a fine from the court. There was no arrest and speeding is not an imprisonable offence in the UK.    Speeding does not go on a criminal record in the UK as it is considered a motoring offence. However I believe I received a conviction. Would I have to declare this on the eVisitor/ETA?    I don't want to go through the hassle of declaring something that's not considered a crime in the UK - anyone else been in a similar situation? ,jamie g,,

hi i'll have six full days. Going alone so think i'd prefer to take tours rather than hire a car. I haven't bought flights yet though looking at late october.

Should i fly in and out of Hobart or look into a open jaw? What organized trips would you recommend?

Or do you guys perhaps think there may be too much flying/shifting between places?    21/04/2024 Fly in -> Melbourne  22/04/2024 Melbourne  23/04/2024 Melbourne  24/04/2024 Melbourne -> Whitesunday  25/04/2024 Whitesunday  26/04/2024 Whitesunday  27/04/2024 Whitesunday  28/04/2024 Whitesunday  29/04/2024 Whitesunday -> Port Douglas  30/04/2024 Port Dougals  01/05/2024 Port Dougals  02/05/2024 Port Dougals  03/05/2024 Port Dougals  04/05/2024 Port Dougals -> Uluru  05/05/2024 Uluru  06/05/2024 Uluru  07/05/2024 Uluru -> Sydey  08/05/2024 Sydney  09/05/2024 Sydney  10/05/2024 Sydney  11/05/2024 Syndey -> Fly out ,Matt,,"London, United..."

Hello again I now have a rough itinerary mapped out for our 4 week roadtrip in a hired motorhome & wondered what people's thoughts on it were.    Leaving Perth 6th November we would drive to Dongara for an overnight stay then  2 nights Denham/Monkey Mia  3 nights Kalbarri & National Park  1 night Mount Magnet - is it worth a visit to Cue while we're there?  3 nights Leonara/Gwalia/Kalgoorlie  4/5 nights Esperance  1 night Hopetoun  1/2 nights Stirling Ranges  2 nights Albany  1/2 nights Walpole/Pemberton  1 night Augusta  2 nights Margaret River  1 night Dunsborough/Bussleton  Need to be back in Perth 4th December    I still have a few days unaccounted for & I wondered if there were any must see places that I've missed or are there places we should spend longer/less time in. I don't want things to be too rigid or too rushed but am worried if we leave all of the decisions until we get there it will descend into chaos. Any advice would be very welcome. Thank you. ,Kath&John C,Western Australia,"Westgate, United..."
I am booking Christmas for a family of 4 with 2 teenagers. What is the nicer accommodation - Poinciana or Anchorage?    We'd prefer a more spacious apartment with a bigger deck so are leaning towards Anchorage 14 but am worried it will be too far away for the teenagers to independently explore the marina and beach etc.    Poinciana 111 looks like its in a great location but looks quite a bit smaller and not as conducive to the kind of relaxing holiday watching the sunset reading a book etc.    Any advice would be appreciated ,balib0und,Hamilton Island,sunshine coast

Hi can I check if Fremantle airport shuttle is the best way to get to my accommodation in fremantle from perth airport? I read some reviews about them being unreliable and poor customer service.

Hi all    We love Tassie and have been there several times. We haven't been since 2019 but have a trip planned in Oct. We are flying in and out of Launceston (flights and car hire significantly cheaper than Hobart) and have 8 nights flying in Sat and out Sun. We are a family of 5 (3 boys aged 2 7 8) and enjoy nature hikes (up to around 8-10km) and good food. Going to the Hobart Harvest markets and Masaaki's are priorities so itinerary at start is built around that.    So far I have pencilled in -    7 Oct - 11am arrival Launceston. 1N Hobart (via whiskey distillery?)  8 Oct - Harvest market then drive to Huon Valley. 2-3N Geeveston (summer kitchen bakery willies apple shed Tahune airways Hartz NP Hastings Cave and Pool)  10/11 Oct - Bruny Island 2N    From 12/13-15 Oct I am not sure where to stay. We have a midday flight out of Launceston so need to be at least within 1-2 hrs of the airport on the night of 14th otherwise flexible at this stage. We could possibly go somewhere 2 nights then 1 night closer to Launceston.    Our most recent stay was a week on the east coast (Falmouth) so not too interested in the unless there is something different you could suggest (we have done all the top activities along there - wineglass bay twice etc).    I was thinking possibly Derby or the Great Lakes region but not too sure any other suggestions?    Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! ,keedm002,Tasmania,"Adelaide, Australia"
There are a total of 6 of us and one is my 90 year old mum.  We hope to visit in sept 9th to 16 sept. Is this a good time to visit pls.  My mum can walk but not far.  We will be hiring a car and hoping to stay in apartments or rental property as opposed to a hotel so we can do some cooking.  Our interest is mainly a road trip taking in coastal and mountain scenery and perhaps including a farm stay. I read that Perth is beautiful.  Would love some recommendations on a place to base ourselves or can we stay in 2 different places and drive around pls.  Read that Margaret‚Äôs river is a love ly place to be.  Hoping for some advice pls.  Can someone also recommend a car rental hire with no excess pls. and a suitable car for 6 adults with at least 6 cabin bags.  I do understand insurance will be high.  Thank you so much for your help  Much appreciated.  Ysh ,sh y,Greater Perth,ireland

I have booked what I thought was a shuttle from Sydney International Airport to Hornsby for a flight arriving at 5.30pm on a weekday but the only option was Book a limo. The cost in AUD was 164.00 but when converted to NZD was $282.83 which is more like the conversion rate for USD to NZD.    Would and Uber or a taxi be cheaper to Hornsby than AUD 164.00 at that time of day? I would like to catch the train but am worried about managing in the rush hour (although I have a small suitcase).    Thanks ,Fretwell,Sydney,
Hi  Is it necessary to buy ferry tickets in advance to Rottnest Island? Is it possible to buy on day itself or the day before? and what happens if weather is bad and the island cannot be opened or ferries cannot sail? Possible to get any refund since we are travellers and not locals?    Also how long a time is estimated for one to enjoy the Rottnes Island? We have two young girls with us.    Is it worth to buy those ferry and bus packages that I saw on Tripadviser? THe buses meant the bus rides on the island? It is like a tour bus that one stays throughout on or one that allows us to get up and down whenever we like for unlimited times?    How about the ferry and bicycles packages? Do the bicycles come with child seats? and are there child size or tween size bicycles? Are the cycling routes easy tto manage?    Or should we just buy all separatedly?    Any discounts for children for the ferries or buses?    With two young children with us do you all advise that it will be easier for us to take the bus or the car?    Thanks. ,carol21132505,Perth,"Singapore, Singapore"
Hi  Can anyone please advise (and also highly confident please) if it is possible at all to get a taxi or call for a uber from Perth Airport to Perth City at timming like 1230am ot past 1am? We are arriving in Perth at around close to midnight in early October. And we are travelling with our two young girls who are both below 12 years old. We have an accommodation booked in Perth city and would like to get to it after our arrival at the airport so that everyone especially the girls can take a good sleep before we start our official holidays the next day.    Is it possible to get a taxi or call for a ride from uber for a pick up from the airport to go to the city at past midnight or even close to or after 1am (it might take a while for clearance at the airport I presume). Will there be taxis waiting at the airport at that time or even uber drivers willing to drive to the airport at that hour? and if so how much will it cost us?    Not super keen to book a private ride before we leave for Perth as it seems to cost so much.    Grateful if someone could advise please.    Thanks. ,carol21132505,Perth,"Singapore, Singapore"
In NZ there is a shop called health2000 they have all sorts of natural health supplements and often you can go in and they can look at something wrong with you and tell you what's wrong or what's lacking. in your diet or a deficiency  since my daughter has been in aussie shes coming out in some viral rash all over the place spots lumps hives . super itchy we thought it was scabies but its not its like a group of raised areas and psoriasis looking rashes some even look like ringworm but mostly not.    Doctors have been useless she hasn't got medicare yet so its expensive for everything so i need to find one of these health food style shops in the gold coast can anyone point out what the equivalent would be and where ,pauls_pad2002,Gold Coast,New Zealand
Hi  I'm travelling to Sydney for NYE the first time. I've just heard that most of the public vantage points will now be free operating on a first come first served basis. I know it's been a while since these events were free but does anyone know what the queue's will be like? We're looking at the Botanic Gardens. Will we have to queue in the morning on the 31st? I'd rather not camp out the night before! just don't want to queue for hours/whole day only to be turned away as it's at capacity! Then it's too late to go elsewhere    Any help appreciated!

We'll be visiting Melbourne in December over Christmas with a 2 year old and trying to decide between Park Hyatt and Rydges Melbourne. They both seem to get good reviews and the price point is similar for the room type we're looking af .  Park Hyatt King Room positives  - Big room  - Quieter area but still close enough to CBD with access to restaurants    Rydges Melbourne Twin King Suite/Apartment positives  - for the same price we have an option of 2 King beds or an option of a kitchenette suite room  - newer/ recently refurbished hotel.    So it's been hard to decide because they both offer things we're looking for  - King Bed  - Swimming Pool  - Accessible to restaurants      So it's been difficult to decide. Has anyone had experience with either of them or even better have been to both and could offer some thoughts? Or which one would you choose for a 7 night stay? ,lildutchpancake,Melbourne,Hong Kong

I'm applying for a Business Trip visa (600) for Australia from India.    Under Health Declarations the application asks:    In the last five years has any applicant visited or lived outside their country of passport for more than 3 consecutive months? Do not include time spent in Australia    To this I have clearly mentioned: No    Still in the document upload section it is asking me to upload Evidence of Travel History under Required Documents. Why is this the case?    If I try to ignore it and go to the next page it asks me the reason why I have not uploaded all the required docs and the visa will not be granted until they are uploaded in the future. I will never be able to upload that cause I don't have any so what to do in this case? Am I missing something? ,Aditya Soni,,"Vadodara, India"

We will be traveling to Mornington Peninsula in mid Dec 2023.  We are 2 adults + 3 kids age 14 11 and 8yo.    I am thinking of visiting Peninsula Hot Spring but not sure if that is a good idea as it will be summer time.  And if I do I am thinking if it will be better to visit early in the morning or later in the evening when the weather is cool or has cooled down.    I read that certain areas (Hillside Pool) only allow kids under 16yo to visit if we arrive before 10am.    And also overall it is a good idea to go in Summer?  Appreciate all your comments especially from those with kids or those who have been there in summer.    Thanks.  Shu-Yin ,tanshuyin,Mornington Peninsula,Penang Island...
We are two active seniors planning a couple of days in Melbourne. We will be arriving on the Southern train from Adelaide and will fly out from MEL. We are currently trying to decide on a hotel. We are looking for clean hotel safe area and handy to the tram area as we will not have a car and we love to walk as much as we can. We have kept the budget for $200 (although would go higher for a fabulous one) and have considered a few hotels. We like quirky or interesting ones but don't need a hotel restaurant or gym etc. Which of the following hotels do you recommend (or not) and would it be better to stay near the train and airport bus stations or anywhere in the CBD? On first glace we like the Rendezous Hotel The Hotel Windsor Brady Hotels Central but would also consider the Movenpick or Great Southern Hotel because of their proximity to the station. We would not be going to bars but would be out at restaurants and possibly theatre. Any and all suggestions appreciated. ,Cynthia F,Melbourne,"Saint John, Canada"
Hi All  We will be in Melbourne for 3 days in late Feb 2024 and we want to go wine tasting in Yarra Valley. We can rent a car and drive - but can't drink and drive much - so really think a tour would be best. But so many of these tours only stop at a couple of wineries and do cheese or lunch - we would love to go to a few wineries over that other stuff. We are Chardonnay drinkers - though will try anything.    can you recommend anything? Many stop at the Yarra Valley Chocolaterie & Ice Creamery which I'm not opposed to (who doesn't like chocolate?). Regardless any thoughts so very welcome and appreciated!    Cheers!  Ellen ,Ellen L,Melbourne,Royersford...

I booked to stay at Desert Gardens Hotel Uluru through their own website Ayers Rock Resort back in February. After seeing a massive drop in price in June I decided to cancel my booking and rebook at the cheaper rate. This was done no problem. The original booking was for 968 AUD which I paid by credit card and was charged at 550GBP. When the refund eventually arrived (after 3 or 4 emails and waiting nearly 2 months) the full 968AUD was refunded according to the email I received from Ayers Rock Resort but my credit card was only charged back 495GBP. My question is who is to blame for the difference my bank or their bank. I know its only 55GBP and the money isn't really important its more the principal. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks. ,ukdebdow,,United Kingdom

I am picking up someone arriving at 5.30am at Sydney Internationl Airport T1: ( usually a crazy busy time often with incredible delays ) Where could I park and have breakfast while waiting for their text to say they're getting their bags? I am familiar with the very convenient option at the domestic terminals where you can wait at Big Mac or The Mantra  have breakfast and when they text you drive only 5 minutes to the pick up point. So incredibly easy!!!!  Is there a similar hotel or even Big Mac where one can do the same near the International?  Or is the only option to use Big mac or Mantra and drive to the international pick up area? ,Sylvia D,Sydney,"Sydney, Australia"

Hello  We are planning a 8D trip - 2 A and 2 kids (9 and 5). Open to renting a car.  We land at 9 PM on day-0 and then have 8 clear days to spend. Leaving on day-9 ard mid-day.    We like to go slow paced - enjoy cafes and restaurants. Interested in nature culture scenic drives and some urban feel. We dont drink - so not into wine but appreciate some wineries are more about the experience and offer food etc too so open to that.    Our family loves staying out till 9-10ish pm - so looking to base ourselves in places which are not shut after 5 pm. So we have some buzz going around for a late evening stroll etc.    Keen on doing couple of days in Perth CBD (KP Mint beach) another 2 days Freo.    Unsure if MR would work to our liking - some friends have suggested there is nothing to do after 5? Are there some areas in MR which are more happening than other perhaps.    Keen on Pinnacles - confused b/w day trip or staying a night.    Prefer to stay in hotels. Not AirBnb/Homestays.    Thanks - and appreciate any tips/guidance. ,travel_love,Greater Perth,"London, United..."

There's a wonderful exhibition of Chagall - Printmaking Poetry Public Arts at the Jewish Museum Alma Road St Kilda until 10 December 2023.  The permanent exhibition is really worthwhile too.

Any ideas on best places for a parrot-obsessed 10 year old to see parrots whether in a zoo/sanctuary or in the wild? :) We are visiting family in Buderim Mackay and Brisbane and we don't want to drive more than a few hours from any of those locations. So far we have on our list: Maleny Botanic Gardens Parrots in Paradise Australia Zoo & Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. I'd really love for her to see parrots in the wild but don't know where. Also I'm not sure if such a place exists but would love to have a rainforest/treehouse experience for a few nights and would be awesome if that could be in a place with wild parrots. Thank you! ,Alana C,Queensland,Laguna Hills...
Hi  Would like to get an eSIM for my phone whilst I visit the East Coast for a month. Which provider would people on here recommend? It's mainly for data but calls would be a bonus. Can the SIM be activated prior to arrival (in Sydney)? I looked at the Optus options and they have mobile plans and prepaid plans. The former lists under eligibility criteria as you must be eligible - not exactly helpful! Any suggestions for a decent SIM without too much hassle to activate would be most appreciated.  Thanks  Peter ,PeteWEdinburgh,,Edinburgh
We're staying on Lady Elliot Island for 2 weeks in October. We will want wetsuits so should we take our own?  Also they recommend reef shoes.

My husband and I (53 and a very fit 69) are considering doing a home exchange for no less than 2 no more than 4 weeks in Australia next October possibly going into November. We have never been to Australia before so I would very much like to hear your suggestions of a city or town that would be a great place for a home exchange of 2-4 weeks. We would like there to be some sites to see to get a sense of what it is like to live there to have convenient neighborhood cafes and some natural beauty at least nearby. Public transportation is a plus. Being able to walk to some places would also be a plus. Australia is such a large country I would like to be happy in our home base though I hope we can make at least a couple short trips to other places in Australia while we are there. I understand we will need to fly to most destinations that the public transportation between cities is not very good. Renting a car is a possibility too. We are on a budget so the home exchange works well for us. We don't need fancy but would like to get a glimpse of what it is like to live like a resident there vs in a hotel as well as see some sites as any tourist would like to do.  Thank you in advance! ,kelleyonthekey,,"Pensacola, Florida"

My husband and I are hoping to drive from Sydney to stay a few days somewhere up to 3 hrs drive south of Sydney. We like swimming in calm water on nice beaches but also like nature walks and interesting little towns and villages. We've been looking at beachfront places in Vincentia and also Mollymook but just need som advice and recommendations. We are in our 70s so no surfing or strenuous hikes for us. A restful relaxing few days in a beautiful place is what we'd like. Thanks so much in advance!!! ,sandra v,Hyams Beach,"Bangor, United..."

Hello  we will be around Brisbane first week of September going direction Daintree and would like to take a boat trip to see whales. Where is the best place for a good experience? We are looking for the best chance to see them ideally above water preferably not too crowded. Only interested in wildlife so not paying SeaWorld and such for their boat. I read Hervey Bay is the best but maybe it is overhyped compared to the rest?  Even we are set on to take the boat trip we would ALSO be interested to see them from coast but it'd need to be great for us to pursue as our time is not unlimited - think Hermanus or iSimangaliso in South Africa.  I read also about possibility of swimming with whales in Mooloolaba that would be amazing but generally it is very expensive and the conditions are disadvantageous (no refunds no free trips with no sightings etc.)  Thanks for all the tips. ,Asanoth,Sunshine Coast,
Been a long time since I lived there or last visited and just making first tentative plans.  There used to be a simple cafe where the prawn trawlers landed and I'm wondering if this is the small restaurant now or if they still do simple food. I can but hope. Google hasn't been my friend.  There was also a small group of cafes and bakery. They were already turning into fancy restaurants along the prom when I last visited. I believe the lovely bakery and Italian have gone now - is that so please?  I also saw a thead about whale watching. We used to have to go to Hervey Bay. Has this changed too? ,Toopaz,Mooloolaba,"England, United..."
Looking at a Kuranda Railway trip but need to find out how long the train spends in tunnels. One member of our group is very claustrophobic so long tunnel transits would be a problem. From what I‚Äôve been able to find it looks like the longest tunnel transit is less than 2 minutes but I need to confirm that. Also how dark are the coaches in the tunnels? ,Bob,Cairns,"Norfolk, Virginia"
Hi!    We are a family of 4 (2 adults 2 boys 4 and 8) who will be travelling to Tasmania for the first time in January. We are joining a group of friends in Orford at the very end of our trip and have decided we will fly in a few days earlier to explore other areas beforehand. I've booked our flights and accom. The accom bookings are flexible until closer to our arrival month.    I've found myself wondering if I should tweak our itinerary slightly. At the moment we have:    Fri - arrive Hobart airport around midday collect hire car and head to Hobart. Afternoon either at Mt Wellington or Mona.  O/N Hobart    Sat - Salamanca Markets Battery point (and Mt Wellington or Mona if missed one the afternoon prior) Head to Port Arthur via Richmond in the late afternoon.  O/N Port Arthur (White's Beach)    Sun - Port Arthur Historical site Coal mines afternoon at beach near accom  O/N Port Arthur (White's Beach)    Mon - AM Tasman NP (Devils Kitchen Tesselated Pavement etc) and Doo-town. Head to Bicheno via Kates Berry Farm.  O/N Bicheno    Tues - Explore Bicheno area Douglas Aspley Waterhole Evening Penguin Tour  O/N Bicheno    Wed - Day trip up to Binnalong Bay / Bay of Fires area  O/N Bicheno    Thurs - Freycinet NP. Head to Orford in late afternoon to meet group of friends.  O/N Orford    Fri - Maria Island  O/N Orford    Sat - Spring Beach and drive to airport in afternoon.    Is it worthwhile doing the day trip to Bay of Fires from Bicheno? Our friend who lives in Hobart implied that you see the same landscapes at Bicheno and Freycinet...? The distance isn't an issue - we day trip to the Gold Coast for swims on the weekend and it is a similar drive.    If it's not worthwhile I am thinking about dropping a night from Bicheno to have an extra day in Hobart (so then we have 2 nights everywhere).    I'm quite torn...

Need to book 4 nights in early February for husband myself and toddler. Ideally apartments park cabins or a house so we have space aswell as car parking. There is so much available on Airbnb all over the city so I have no idea which area would be better prices are all pretty similar and within budget. We‚Äôll mainly be doing day trips outside of the city so we don‚Äôt need to be in the CBD but some restaurants or access to food delivery nearby or parks for our toddler would be a benefit. ,Nicole,Launceston,"Cairns, Australia"
Hello  I'm going to Australia in Nov/Dec 2023 as a 24 year old solo female traveller from the UK. I am planning to meet a friend for a few days in Sydney and then go off on my own up to the East Coast possibly going to Uluru too and finishing in Cairns. I want to visit a long-distance relative in who lives near Brisbane/Gold Coast for one afternoon. Other than my dates and locations below I am up for anything.    I am arriving into Sydney on Sat morning 18th November and out of Cairns on 6th December.    Can someone give me some recommendations for an itinerary please? Finding it a bit overwhelming at the moment to decide what to do/ what not to do. If I could fit in any of the islands that would be good to know too.    At present was thinking something along the lines of the below but honestly very easy going and open to suggestions. The key things I want to fit in are Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest and maybe Uluru if possible but if more to do on the East Coast that I should go to instead then happy to give it a miss.    I'd love to swim with some marine animals (e.g. either whales sharks dolphins etc.) if able to but accept this may not be possible with the season but any suggestions on where might be able to do this would also be greatly appreciated.    Sydney Sat 18th Nov - Thurs 23rd Nov - 5 nights (2 days to see a friend and then spend rest of time doing touristy things)  Fly to Uluru - Thurs 23 - Sat 25th Nov - 2 nights  Gold Coast - Sat 25th Nov - Thurs 30th Nov - 5 nights (this would include one day of visiting family)  Cairns - Thurs 30th Nov - Weds 06 Nov - 6 nights (Great Barrier Reef The Daintree Rainforest open to other suggestions - might go to Port Douglas for a few nights)    Many thanks    Jemma :) ,Jemma,,
does anyone know what happen last year? was the 2 nights min rule also in place and did the rooms all got sold out with that rule? bc afaik  there's not enough worthwhile to warrant 2 nights stay. so i am wondering who will be booking it even in peak season (august)    kings creek station doesnt work (or cost almost the same) bc we have 3 in the traveling party.    my last resort is to wake up early and do it as a long trip (Uluru-KC-Alice) hike rim for 3h in the middle of the day. but this is terrible timing for photography bc it's neither sunrise nor sunset.    maybe just have to pay through my nose for deluxe room ,mrc282,Kings Canyon,World
Dear Australian friends  I know this forum is meant to ask questions and I have asked and received outstanding answers to many questions.  My wife and I spend 2 fabulous trips of 9 weeks each back in 2015 and 2017.  One advisor on TA was of just great help and was so friendly that she met us for lunch the day we arrived in 2017.  On a day trip in the metropolis of Barcaldine QLD we met a couple from Australia who were traveling and we all felt an instantaneous attraction to one another. Long story short since those few days in Barry and Longreach they came to the US to see us for 5 weeks. We had a marvelous time showing them around Texas New Mexico and Arizona. Then a year later met in Hawaii. Then Covid happened. But we Facetime regularly.  Since 2017 my precious wife of 50 years has sufferered the inhumanity of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. After 3 years it reached a point I could no longer keep her safe and I had to have her go live in a private long term care facility.  After some time I have decided I have to do things we would have done together so in August I am again traveling to Australia - this time to visit my friends there and hopefully to make more.  I‚Äôve traveled a great deal in my adult life. Nowhere interests me like Australia.  So thank everyone on TA who helped me back in 2015 and 2017. Thanks to those trips I now have wonderful Australian friends. The scenery is spectacular but the people are better.  Best regards  and Australia I‚Äôll see you again August 11.

Hello  we are travelling to Sydney for a wedding with our then to be 13 months' old at the end of Jan - beginning of Feb 2023. We would like to stay for the first week on/near a baby friendly beach and then more to Sydney Harbour for the remaining 4 nights. I couldn't find any relevant recent threads on Tripadvisor so I would wander in if anyone could recommend:  - a baby friendly hotel (preferably with child care and/or baby play facilities) on a baby friendly beach or a nice serviced apartment;  - a few baby friendly worth visiting beaches;  - baby friendly hotel (preferably with child care and/or baby play facilities) in Sydney Harbour.  our budget for the hotel is ideally ¬£150 but we can go up to ¬£250 for the right place.  - reliable and professional baby sitting services  - any other must know tips for traveling with baby in Sydney would also be appreciated.    Sadly our friends who are getting married don't have children so can't offer any real help with the above    Many thanks.  Anastasia ,Hownice2cu,Sydney,United Kingdom
When I saw the extremely high price to take a car on SeaLink I assumed the more convenient Qantas flight was the right choice. (Flight is actually cheaper than the ferry even without a car.) Just looked at car prices at KGC and they're sooo much higher than ADL. (You can't take your car on the ferry or on dirt roads. etc isn't a concern as my credit card will provide primary auto coverage.) I guess there's no way around this either option will be super expensive. Tours suddenly aren't as bad. except we greatly prefer the freedom a car provides enabling one to go where you want when you want. Anything I'm missing? Thank you. ,Craig,Kangaroo Island,

I applied via the app for the visa to enter Australia and was approved. In the meantime we have had to get our daughter a new passport (US Passport) and I am not sure how best to update. I can add the passport but under applicant details it lists the old passport as the one applicant will use to enter Australia. I am not opposed to reapplying just don't want it to get denied because she has one on another passport number. Any advice on how to fix this? Thanks! ,WhereInTheWorld,,

Intending to visit Perth and the southwest corner during October. Wanting to visit wildflower areas beaches and nature's best. Thinking of booking accommodation in Perth (for 2 days) before heading east to wave rock (for 2 days) and then taking 3 weeks to do a loop down south along the southern and west coast back up to Perth. Do i need to prebook accommodation or would there be plenty of accommodation available at that time in the major towns?

Hello    we are going to Australia 25 days of self camping and self cooking on butane cooker. Do you have any experience with how to leave the gas bottles in a (small) car over day? Is it enough to wrap them in some clothes/sleeping bag or so?    I do not really think bringing them with when hiking or so or leaving them wherever on a parking lot is a viable option... Butane needs to be stored below 50 ¬∞C which is way less than it is in a car on a sunlight after a few hours.    How do people generally do that on such kind of vacation?    Thank you. ,Asanoth,,
Hello  we are going to Queensland next week for 25 days super budget roadtrip and would like to get one or two data sim cards.

Are there any such prepaid sim cards on offer or do we need to bite the bullet with the 30 AUD sim?  Thank you. ,Asanoth,,

So today we spent on Rottnest Island and now having returned to our hotel in Perth I have to face the fact that I lost one of my cameras. Looking back I know exactly when and where around 3 pm on the lawn in front of the jetty while re-packing our day packs.    I am old enough to be pretty sure that most people who find a 800 $ camera (it's a DJI Pocket 2 for those who are familiar with these gadgets) will not try to return it to its owner but hey who knows maybe I'm wrong.    Unfortunately going back and looking / inquiring for it in person is not an option we are on a tight schedule and will be heading north first thing tomorrow morning but maybe I can call someone or write an eMail? Is there something like a Lost and Found office? (Once again: I am positive I did not lose it on the ferry).    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Greater Perth,"Cologne, Germany"

Hi everyone    We‚Äôre coming up to Port Douglas soon with our two kids (2 and 4).    We are thinking of a day trip to Green Island or Fitzroy Island but have heard mixed reviews on both are they worth it and is either recommended more?  We thought the island would be the better option for a day trip rather than going out to the reef given they‚Äôre still little.    We‚Äôd be happy playing at the beach and doing some basic snorkelling but if either has better activities for little kids that would be the preference.    Thanks!! ,Em2,Cairns,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi all    I'm planning on squeezing in a few days visiting Tassie in December while visiting a friend in Sydney. I will be arriving Tassie late morning on a Saturday and will need to fly out early morning on a Wednesday (essentially 4 days).    I can't decide whether to land in Launceston on the Saturday making the drive to Cradle Mountain shorter and getting a glimpse of Launceston; or to land in Hobart and get to visit Salamanca Markets for a couple of hours before I drive to Cradle Mountain (needing an additional 2+ hours of driving on the road which I don't really mind too much). Either way I would go to Hobart on Monday morning after Cradle Mountain stay there for 2 nights before leaving early morning on the Wednesday. I'm accustomed to driving; sunset won't be till after 8.30pm during December.    So the key question is: Is it worth the extra 2hrs of driving and missing 3hrs in Launceston for Salamanca Markets? Can I see the same/similar arts and crafts at fixed brick and mortar stores when I return to Hobart on a weekday? Key interests would be wool products paintings and small trinkets/arts and crafts. If it's just the vibe I will be willing to forgo and simply land in Launceston. I would imagine a lot of the more prominent stores at the market would have a day to day fixed store somewhere... can I get some commentary on this; and what/where might these be?    Option 1:  11.30am Land in Launceston  Launceston lunch and a few sites around city centre such as City Park Design Tasmania QVMAG (not interested in Cataract Gorge).  4pm Depart to Cradle Mountain  6pm Arrive Cradle Mountain to settle in    Option 2:  11.30am Land in Hobart  Hobart lunch and Salamanca Market  2.30pm/3pm Depart to Cradle Mountain  7pm Arrive Cradle Mountain to settle in    Thanks! ,Hiki08,Tasmania,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi all    We will have 4 full days in Barossa Valley from 1/10 - 4/10 with a base in Gawler (4 adults+ 3 children 17 14 & 11 yr old). Hoping to put together an itinerary to have a balance b/w visiting most notable wineries most picturesque towns in Barossa and not run over our feet. Seeking recommendations of how to best plan the 4 days and which towns and wineries are not to be missed.  Do we need to allow one day per one town or are there couple of towns which are next to each other which is doable in 1 day? So far I understand that most talked about towns are: Tanunda Gawler Nuriootpa & Greenock? Also Marananga was mentioned.  Our only experience with wineries is from McLaren Vale region and we were very impressed with D'arenberg & Wirra Wirra wineries. I know that BArossa is far more older region but any advice for a wow experience would be recommended. Thanks in advance :-) ,LeapingFrog,Barossa Valley,"Melbourne, Australia"
HI Everyone.    I am hoping to be in Australia for 3 - 4 weeks next year starting in late March and extending into April. My current plan is to spend time in 3 locations: Sydney Alexandra Headland (to explore the Sunshine Coast and see Australia Zoo) and Airlie Beach (to explore the Whitsundays and the Outer Reef).    What can I expect as to the weather in each of these places at this time of year? I realize that Sydney weather is likely not the same as that of the Queensland coast. Also are the stingers an issue at all Australia beaches or are they more predominant in Queensland? Do most beaches typically have stinger nets/protected areas for swimming or will I need to plan for a wetsuit?    Thank You! ,Michelle F,,Manchester...
Hello  My family of 3 adults and 1 child (10yo) will be spending about 9-10 days in Tasmania. This is a rough plan for our trip and I'd like to seek your advice specifically for day 4 please if it would be a good idea to drive from Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary to Bicheno directly. Based on time estimation we thought we should be able to reach Bicheno in time for the penguin tour at around 7+ pm in the evening. Or should we schedule the tour the next day after our visit to Freycinet National Park instead?    I'd also appreciate if you have any advice for the plan -- especially for parts that may not look practical to you.

Planning a trip to Sydney in October. Could anyone tell me where we can see kangaroos and koalas?  Would it be better to go to a zoo or a planned trip where kangaroos and koalas might be? I understand that I won‚Äôt be able to pet them but would just love to observe them would it be better in the wild? Any recommendations anyone please? Thank you ,jools4444,Sydney,Newcastle upon...
Checked in to the Sebel Quay West. Thanks to TripAdvisor forum for the advice. It‚Äôs a great hotel in a great location. Spacious and clean rooms. We walked to dinner at The Morrison because it was close and we were hungry. We all liked our dinners and really liked the cocktails. Woke up and walked around the Rocks grabbing breakfast at La Renaissance Patisserie and Cafe. We then walked to the Opera House because we couldn‚Äôt wait to get up close. Walked to the library because my daughter loves libraries and then took a cab to Icebergs at Bondi. My husband took a swim in the freezing pool and we all cheered him on before making our noon reservation for lunch. Food was good and view was spectacular. We then did the walk to Bronte where my husband took another swim this time in the ocean. We all ran around the shore and played some ball before continuing our walk. It was a perfect day out and we were blown away by the beaches. We are from California and our beaches pale in comparison to the Sydney beaches. Definitely want to come back when the water is a bit warmer. Came back to our hotel and went to the Friday night market at Chinatown for dinner. Exhausted! Next day we my husband and son walked across the bridge (just the regular way not the top) and my daughter and I went to the market in the Rocks. This was after we ate all the Belgian chocolate at that little cafe in the Rocks. Kids and husband wanted to rest after this but I went to Pitt street to shop (loving the exchange rate). We all met up and walked through the Botanic gardens and enjoyed a rest on a bench with gorgeous views. We went from there to do a little more shopping (made the kids get some stuff for school) and then went to our reservation at Chin Chin. This was a recommendation from friends and it was delicious. Our favorite meal of the trip. Loud and hip restaurant but my kids liked it. The next morning we had reservations for a tour of the Opera House. The kids weren‚Äôt excited by any of the current performances so we thought this would be a good way to get in the venue. It was a great tour and very informative. Held my kids attention. We then took the ferry to Manly Beach and got lunch. Headed home tired. Took a break and then walked to Darling Harbor for dinner. Took the ferry back to the Quay for gelato and headed back to the hotel. We really liked Sydney. We were blown away by public transportation and how easy effective and clean it is. Probably the cleanest transit I‚Äôve ever seen in a major city. We all also commented on how clean all the bathrooms are. Kind of an odd thing but we really notice it with kids. We really liked the vibe of Sydney (per my son). It was our last stop in a 17 day trip so I think we were all a little tired when we got here. It once again felt like it would be a great place to live. We loved it! ,CalBear_02,,"San Francsico, CA"
So we arrived at Perth late Thursday night unfortunately too late for the free shuttle to our airport hotel which meant we had to take a cab. When we told the driver where we needed to go he started to lament that he'd been waiting for three hours and now he was stuck with such a short trip so I wonder:    Are the taxi drivers (at airports) by law obliged to accept any route / fare or could he have refused us his service? (In the end it was a 50 $ fare).    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,,"Cologne, Germany"
First time visiting this beautiful part of the world 25-29sept.  I am a bit lost as to what to do. Should I spend the 4 nights in Hobart or a night elsewhere? Will I need a car? I love the idea of a comfy bed and breakfast.  I love to explore I love food scenery visiting towns countryside a bit of art history.  Any tips for a great balance I‚Äôd love to hear.

Hi Friends  Our flight will be reaching at around 10:15 PM and planning to drive to our accommodation in Port Douglas around that time. Is it a wise option to drive to Port Douglas in the night or is it better to stay overnight in Cairns city and head out in the morning.    As our rental car pickup is at Cairns Airport  we want to confirm what is it like to drive in the night before we make changes to our accommodation.    Note : We are from Victoria and hence driving conditions are not a problem.    Any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated.    Cheers  K ,Kalyan Nagelli,Cairns,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hi  Husband and I (young 50s) are just starting to plan a trip to WA from UK. We have to travel in UK school hols so travelling August for about 3 weeks in a stopover in Bali on way back. We have been to Oz twice before (east coast) and are reasonably experienced travellers. We‚Äôre thinking of a week ish in Perth/Fremantle area and a week ish in the Broome area. We realise it‚Äôs winter but are from northern UK so even Perth winter will be warmer than most of our summer! Happy to hire a car if needed. We like food/wine exploring history wildlife. What do you think are the most important things to see/visit? Rottnest Island and Cable Beach are on the list so far. Thank you. ,Sam P,Western Australia,"Lancashire, United..."
I would love to spend more time exploring my own country but accommodation in particular seems to just be so expensive especially if you want to travel in the next month or two. It doesn't seem that long ago that you could use a service like booking.com stayz or airbnb and find a range of affordable places to stay. Now it's very common that many places are $400+ a night which is unaffordable for us. Of course it's often possible to find something more reasonable but you have to look long and hard. Sometimes we stay in pubs which is okay but a bit hit or miss.    Eating out is also a lot more expensive both compared to the past and compared to other countries.    Every time I plan a holiday in Australia I end up deciding that our money will go a lot further in other countries including Europe. Am I missing a way to find reasonable places to stay for $100-$200/night for a couple? I suspect I'm falling into that category of people who hanker for times past when things were more affordable but this is pushing us into travelling overseas (not a hardship at all but not always possible) instead of exploring our own country. I do realise that this is a first world problem and that many can't afford a holiday at all.    Any thoughts? ,Escape9876,,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hi  I know I know not enough time but that's what we have :) I'm trying to decide if I should try to fit in Melbourne Cairns and Sydney or skip Melbourne.

Would appreciate any thoughts or itineraries. We are from the U.S. but will be in French Polynesia first then New Zealand before Australia. ,sandymc,,

Dear all    We will be visiting Australia in Dec/Jan with our 2 kids (age 4 & 6). We will drive from Brisbane to Sydney in 5-6 days having 5 nights to spend along the trip. (January 10th to 15th)    We plan to drive down the pacific highway and sleep in 3-4 different locations. Looking for a good mix of beaches towns kid friendly activities and potential (inland) parks or attractions. This drive is only part of our bigger 4wk Australia trip so we aim to minimize the driving distances and also relax a bit here and there.    Where would you recommend us spending those days and nights? We don‚Äôt mind spending just 1 night in a place but doing 2 in one location once or twice would also be nice.    Finally; we will be driving a rental car but we love camping. Any tips for holiday parks that rent cabins or other ways to experience camping life without the actual motorhome/caravan would be greatly appreciated!    Many thanks in advance for any tip or reco looking forward to visiting your beautiful country!    Best  Mark ,MarkdeBruijn2013,Pacific Coast Australia,Den Haag

I'm booked on Qatar flight from Heathrow to Sydney via Melbourne where I pick up a Virgin flight for the Melbourne/Sydney leg. I booked through Virgin and have a 1 hr 30 min transfer time at Melbourne. Has anyone done this trip and is the transfer enough time? I have called Virgin and received mixed messages about checked luggage but assuming I have to clear immigration collect luggage clear customs recheck luggage the time isn't enough?  Has anyone done this flight? One Virgin customer service person said the luggage would be checked to Sydney but that doesn't make sense as arrival at Syd will be domestic therefore where does the luggage go through customs. Very confused and not sure whether to weather the cost of changing booking. Sydney flight is the last one of the evening so no chance of getting a later one if it's missed. Thanks in advance ,clare d,,
Hi all I've got a flight booked LHR/MEL/SYD all through Virgin with VA flight numbers - LHR-Mel with Qatar. Virgin have provided 1.35 hrs transfer at Mel international to onward domestic Syd flight. I am assuming I will need to collect luggage immigration and recheck luggage at Mel. Transfer time was provided by virgin but doesn't seem long enough. Anyone have any experience of this? The Mel-Syd flight is 8:30 in the evening and the last one scheduled so I know its the airlines responsibility to get you transferred if they set the transfer time but I don't want to be stuck in Mel overnight.

I'm looking at the 3 major stints - Perth to Adelaide Adelaide to Melbourne Melbourne to Sydney. Now I can see there is a huge distance between Perth and Adelaide and what I would like to know is: Is there enough to see between Esperance and Adelaide to make it worth all that travelling? Or would I be better to just do Perth Ningaloo and Margaret River etc and then FLY from Perth to Adelaide and forget whats in between?

I would like to book an apartment in an area that it will make it easy for me to get around using public transport/ walking so that I manage to see Sydney during the few hours that I will not be working. I have seen some apparments in woolloomooloo area that are within my budget (around 300aud per day) and was wondering if it is easy to get around from there.

I understand that some of you regulars are following our trip so here we are after 4 days in Sydney and a week in (or on?) Tasmania we finally flew west arriving in Perth late Thursday night then spending yesterday and the majority of today in the Wheat Belt before just now settling into our hotel back here in Perth.    Tomorrow we plan to spend the morning in the CBD and then head for Scarborough and / or Cottesloe in the afternoon whereas Monday is reserved for a combination of Fremantle and Rottnest. My thinking is that we start with the Island and then use the rest of whatever time is then left for Fremantle. Does that make sense or should we finish with Rottnest?    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Greater Perth,"Cologne, Germany"

And does the daytime train ever sell out? Or it can generally be booked at the last minute?    Thanks a lot! ,travelwiz13,,United States

Hi folks and amazing TA community!    Hubby and I are taking a trip to the wild wild west for our first time. We come from a beautiful coastal area in Sydney and love the beach and active lifestyle. We want to have a relaxing time exploring a bit of the north and south of Perth and don't want to feel like we have spent out whole time driving.    I have read many of previous threads and suggestions and know 10 days is ambitious to cover off up to Kalbarri and Margaret River but I am deadset on seeing the PInnacles and getting up to Hutt Lagoon (the pink lake has always been on my bucket list) and Margaret River and Busselton also look too spectacular to miss although this can be negotiated out for another more feasible/attractive alternative.    We have mapped out the first half of the trip (Days 1-6) and wanted to get feedback if you think it would be doable/enjoyable/relaxing and not rushing too much before we cement the 2nd half (all ideas and suggestions absolutely welcome). We are not into night life (non drinkers) camping or diving but love nature hiking wildlife/bird spotting and cycling.    Proposed itinerary:  Day 1 - Arrive Perth airport 10.30am. Make way into CBD to pick up rental car 12pm. Explore Kings Park/lunch before heading down to Pinnacles/Cervantes. Overnight Cervantes.  Day 2 - Cervantes to Dongara. Leuseur NP. Overnight Dongara.  Day 3 - Dongara to Kalbarri. 3 nights in Kalbarri. Hutt Lagoon and Kalbarri NP hiking.  Day 6 - Kalbarri to Fremantle. (Am not sure about this part as it will be a long day). Could break down this leg and stay somewhere we didn't explore on the way up maybe Jurien Bay? 2 nights in Freo.  Day 8 - Freo to Margaret River/Busselton. 2 nights  Day 10 - Margaret River to Perth CBD. Return rental car  DAy 11 - 6am flight    Thanks in advance for your help and recommendations muchly appreciated! ,Lanni L,,"Sydney, Australia"

Greetings everyone. We have left our holiday plans for special wedding anniversary a bit late to get the places we were looking at for August. And rather than a tropical pacific island we were looking at Australia. We have been to port douglas cairns brisbane gold coast lord howe island etc. Looked at other places but thinking Noosa seems to fit our requirements and is easy to get to from nz We are mild adventurer couple. We love paddle boarding snorkelling walking biking. Love whale spotting. We are actually happy to shop local and eat in. Dont like shopping! Love to be by the ocean.    Would appreciate any recommendations for nice beachfront places to stay (tingirana looks great but dont want to spend that much on accommodation when we intend to be exploring most of the time) and recommended areas we should look at for great beaches swimming snorkelling walking and cycling. We intend doing a day trip to K‚Äôgari and a whale trip.    Would appreciate any suggestions and comments. We are usually a bit more intrepid travellers but a serious health event has made us a bit more cautious. ,nzp0ppy,Noosa,Nelson-Tasman...

Hi! I'll be travelling to Australia soon for a year (working holiday) and am in the process of applying for an international driving permit to be allowed to drive there. According to the Finnish motoring association for Australia I can choose to get either the 1-year 1949 convention IDP or the 3-year 1968 convention IDP. I wanted to get the 3-year one as the 1-year one is only valid for a year from date of issue and as I need to apply for it a few weeks before leaving for Australia it'll cease being valid before my one year in the country is up. Also I might spend a couple weeks in New Zealand before going home and might want to drive there which would make the 3-year IDP necessary. Again according to the Finnish motoring association both IDPs are valid in NZ.  I've been doing some research and I can't find much information on whether the 3-year permit is actually valid in Australia or not. I've seen lots of posts/blogs saying that depending on where you're from you might need an IDP to drive and it's valid for a year... never any mentions of 3 years. Also Wikipedia says that only the 1-year IDP is valid in Australia (and New Zealand). Should I trust my motoring association and go for the 3-year one still? I am thinking about getting a NSW drivers license when I get there anyway which should allow me to drive the entire year. Then with a 1-year IDP I'd only miss out on driving in NZ.  Thanks for any help! ,Jessy,,Finland

Hello :)    This will be our first visit to Tasmania self-drive for 14 days (mid May).  We have travelled to Australia for a couple of times but this is our first time renting an EV.    As mentioned in another thread Tassie is a great place to tour around in an EV as the attractions are not far from each other. With the help of google map it shows the locations of the charging stations (Chargefox is free for my rental EV) and finding the alternative charging network (self-paid) using the Plugshare app.    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g255096-i887-k14314497-Car_pick_up_and_return_at_Launceston_Airport-Tasmania/    We are not planning to book accommodation that provides EV charging but to charge along the route / nearby accommodation before we end the day therefore our itinerary is not crowded with many locations per day for more flexibility in the EV charging.    Will be staying at these locations:  - Launceston  - CM region  - Bicheno  - Hobart    Anyone with advices & tips to make our EV journey more efficient and smoother?  Thanks :)    Cheers Mel ,RyanMelSG,Tasmania,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hey guys    We are departing t2 in under 3 weeks to DFW ‚Äú16hr flights‚Äù with our 16 month old.

We are flying to Melbourne from Hobart at 6.20am and will have 6hrs in the airport prior to boarding so we figured a shower to freshen up Bub might be a good opportunity.

I‚Äôd assume that foot wear would be a must seeing as it‚Äôs a public facility‚Ä¶    And I read that WH smith sell bathing kits if need be..

II have not been able to find a definitive answer online to the question Do I need a park pass to see the Field of Lights?

Some of the posts here made me nervous about how long it might take to get a tourist visa. Using the ETA app I entered my info scanned my passport page had it detect my passport chip and used the app to take a photo of myself. They send along a code to your email to verify it and use the location of your phone to verify that you are currently outside the country. I did not have to provide any travel details. It took maybe ten minutes. After I paid my AUS$20 by credit card it said I was done. I received my visa approval just moments later by email. FYI I am a USA citizen. ,TravelDreamin,,California

If I want to do a day trip to the Blue Mountains via train can I just walk around on the trails and viewpoints near Katoomba for free without paying admission to the Scenic World park?    Also if I took a morning train and stayed through the afternoon could I have a good look? Is there any reason to spend the night?    About when would the last train back to Sydney depart?    Thanks! ,travelwiz13,Sydney,United States
What part of the city would you recommend staying for transport links? I like to stay in a city for a few days and really use my feet and public transport to explore a lot of different areas. Anywhere in particular better than another area? Obviously if there was an area that was scenic central and a little hipster that would be great. I'm overwhelmed right now. ,travelwiz13,Sydney,United States

Hi    I am intending to visit Perth coming end Nov to eary Dec with my family. We will most likely not be renting a car if getting taxi or private ride like uber is easy.

Hi all we're off to Europe this year and have always used the 28 Degrees Card (now Latitude) when travelling and it has been great as it's low on fees and overseas transaction costs.    However I saw a recent review that Latitude now sends a confirmation text (two-authentication security thingy) when you use the card. This doesn't work if you're using an overseas SIM in your phone... (or if you are using your own roaming service on your regular phone it adds to the cost of unnecessary texts).    Has anyone else experienced this? Can anyone suggest another alternative credit card with low/no ATM or international conversion fees?    thanks ,aussieshorty,,"Caringbah, Australia"

Ouch!    In answer to another question I posted a helpful TA member warned me to bring a credit card with PIN.

Considering Esim options for our visit to these areas. The easiest choice is Airolo which uses Optus.    Question 1; is Optus coverage as good as others (no I‚Äôm not expecting much coverage in Kakadu NP for example - my Q is is Optus as good as others)    Question 2; are local communications habits such that a data only plan (no calls so only WhatsApp or iMessage and email) is going to work for me? I‚Äôve found this true in many countries but don‚Äôt know about Australia    Choosing an Esim to load up before our travel is so much more convenient than messing around after arrival to find a store while jet lagged filling out paperwork waiting in line etc ,OutdoorsAdventurer,,"New York City, New..."

Morning Tassie experts!    Excited to finally come back to Tasmania after nearly 20 years away!! I'll be there late September for a week and a bit and am trying to get a little organised. Have a rental car through Uber Car share that's big enough to sleep in the back if needed (and a national parks pass woohoo) and am keen to explore again. Will spend the first weekend in Hobart and see the MONA (which didn't exist when I was there last!) and potter around Hobart Salamanca markets etc). As far as what to do in and around Hobart I feel I am all set- thank you. I won't be doing Port Arthur this time around either as already been and mostly keen to get out into nature- though sadly have a few 'active middle age lifestyle' injuries that will prevent me from doing multi day walks (otherwise would have been on the 3 capes walk quick smart!) but can definitely manage some day hikes so long as they are say 4 hours max return.    I suppose after the first weekend in Hobart I have a solid 7- 8 days I can really do whatever I want and would love your advise on how to balance the trip. I don't drink alcohol anymore so will give the wineries a miss from a drinking POV but always love trying local cheese and other foods- though attempting to do this trip on somewhat of a 'single parent travelling solo' budget so would probably only splurge once or twice on something flash (like lunch at a winery etc) and try to shop local/farm door/self catered where possible instead. Mosty I just want to get out into nature (on a bit of a spiritual cleanse/nature rewilding mission at the moment) and do some lovely walks be immersed in nature and maybe even finish a new book if I'm lucky! Thinking to find some hostels or rooms in air bnb's or little cabins to stay in (there seem to be a lot of options still) and have the trusty road trip worthy car if needed as well (and a warm sleeping bag).    I'm also a sauna junkie so of course the sauna community raves about the Floating sauna in Derby (aware it's a bit far and wasn't sure if it was worth the effort). Once upon a time I travelled to Freycinet which was amazing though it has been quite some time so probably worth going back? Never been to Cradle Mountain Maria Island Bruny Island north or west. coast. all of which i know would be amazing. It's hard to narrow it down to just a few things!!!    Would love your advice on where you would go and how long to spend in each place (how many nights)? I had this hope of seeing the Tarkine (spending a few days there doing some bushwalks maybe even volunteering for a day or two) but b/c i'm flying in and out of Hobart i suppose that may have to be saved for a future trip- and possibly a summer trip at that!    Welcome your suggestions and thanks!!!  x ,Avi,Tasmania,"Sydney, Australia"
Last minute trip to Australia ! (incredible miles redemption from San Francisco) We leave next week. Kids are teens.    Trying plan our 3 full days in Sydney to maximize our time. I have been reading posts and have a list of things to do (all the main attractions) but was wondering if you have any suggestions as far as itinerary goes.    Day 1:  Land at 7am    WWC 8:30pm    Day 2:    Day 3:    Day 4:  Morning - Whale watching?  Flight to Cairns at 4:50pm    We are staying at Rydges but can change if not good (grabbed it to have an option for family of 5)    1. Where is the best place to see Australian animals? We don't generally do zoos (my 3 kids have never been) is there any other way to see them that is not a zoo with enclosures? (no interest in seeing other animals)    2. Our visas were approved immediately except for my youngest son. He is the only one who was born in the Philippines (we were expats there) so I assume that is why. He has both EU and US passports so I am puzzled but also a bit nervous. What if he doesn't get a visa? Have you heard of any EU/US citizen not being able to get a tourist visa? ,IlariaK,Sydney,"Saratoga, California"

Landed in Cairns in the afternoon . Got our rental car and went to check in at the Pullman Cairns. Hotel is definitely dated but the location was great. Dropped our stuff and went to explore. My kids were starving so walked a bit and checked out the man made lagoon but they needed to eat. Salthouse was busy in a good way so we got seats at the bar and ate there. Food was good and I loved my drink. We walked around town and bought some necessities. Went to bed early (again). Woke up early and decided to head straight to Yungaburra. We were initially going to stay in the Atherton Tablelands but thought it might be too remote. We made it up there and checked out the visitor center. We didn‚Äôt have real plans and the ladies there were very helpful and told us where to go. We ate in town mailed a postcard (my daughter loves to send them) and went to Millaa Millaa falls. Beautiful falls but lots of tour vans. My husband and I swam but it was too cold for the kids. We then headed towards Mungalli and stopped for lunch at the dairy. What a treat. We shared the cheese plate kids got iced chocolates (I don‚Äôt know how they are different from a milkshake but apparently they are). Service was slow but it was beautiful and we didn‚Äôt mind. We then checked out Mungalli Falls and wished we were there at sunset to see the platypus. Somehow it was already 3pm. We drove back and stopped at Josephine falls. My son really wanted to swim but it was late and cool. If I did it again I would have prioritized Josephine falls. It was gorgeous and the pool was so deep. Drove home (too much driving for one day) and grabbed dinner at the hotel (food was mediocre). We loved the Atherton Tablelands. It was gorgeous. We had no idea what to expect (very little written in any guidebook). Rolling hills water and beautiful trees. Loved it! Wish we had another day there. Really too bad it‚Äôs not on more tourists radars (at least tourists coming from California)  The next morning we went to Rusty‚Äôs marketplace and got smoothies and white pineapples. It was fun walking around and checking out all the tropical fruit. We bought white pineapple. In Hawaii it costs about $20 and here it was $5! Next it was on to Port Douglas. We stopped At Hartley‚Äôs on the way. Completely freaked my kids and myself out but I think that was the point. We spent about 2 hours there and it was plenty. Got to PD around 1pm and we were starving. Seemed that every place was full. It‚Äôs odd because many restaurants had open tables. I know they were reserved but it seems that restaurants hold tables when they could let diners in and let them know they have limited time. Anyway we found food and then checked in at the Mandalay Luxury apartments (great location and perfect for our family) and took a nap! After some rest we walked on Four Mile Beach and watched all the people swim (we were informed there could be crocs so we stayed out). Left the kids at home (they still full from lunch) and husband and I went to Surfy‚Äôs. We had made a reservation and thank goodness because they were turning people away. There were once again open tables but now we know. Second half of Port Douglas to come‚Ä¶ ,CalBear_02,Cairns Region,"San Francsico, CA"

Family of 4 (kids 11 & 15) will be in Melbourne as part of a larger Australia trip next June 2024. I currently have 8 hotels on my list that I have narrowed it down to. All are under my $500 USD/ $785 AUD budget. I guess my question is how important is location is we plan to not hire a car and do public transit or guided tour. I keep reading about areas to avoid but we just got back from NYC and nothing there concerned me. My top choice is probably the Next Hotel but that is at the higher end of the budget. Is it that much better than say The Adina Melbourne that is 1/2 my budget? ,camk14,Melbourne,"Phoenix, Arizona"

Hi all    Our family ran into a frustrating situation with Stayz and are now stuck.    I booked an accommodation in Nerong NSW on Stayz. There were issues with the payment as the system keeps deducting random amounts and the host was unresponsive to all my inquiries.    After so much back-and-forth I decided to call it a day and put in a request to cancel. However host has gone MIA and has not approved the request to cancel. Stayz app is broken and I cannot access customer support.    Has anyone been in such situation before? Will the request to cancel been nullified once the trip date has passed?    I had good experience with Stayz before but I guess we never know until we actually run into problems and need their customer service. ,Piyemingo,Sydney,

Landed and checked in to our Airbnb. It was spacious clean and comfortable. It‚Äôs called the Blue Door and was on Murray Ln. It ended up being a great location to walk to restaurants and really access the city. As soon as we dropped our luggage off we walked to meet our Adelaide Greeter and got a quick snack at Dumpling King. It was busy so we figured it was probably decent. It fit the bill (we just wanted a quick bite) We met our Adelaide Greeter two hours after landing. She was amazing. Sheryl gave us a tour of the city after asking what we were interested in and told us the history of Adelaide. She pointed out some cute shops and restaurants and then we all went to a rooftop bar 2KW for wine and snacks. Went home and fell right to sleep.  Next morning up early and headed to get a coffee and breakfast on our way to Sheryl‚Äôs house. She invited us to see her property in the Adelaide hills. What a treat! She has a hobby farm and two dogs that entertained my son as we walked the property. It was very special. She then came with us to Handorf to walk us around. We grabbed some sweets and coffee and she told us all about the area. We said our goodbyes and we went on to Sidewood winery (Sheryl suggested it with kids). They had a little play area for the kids to run around and we tried their fabulous whites. After that we headed to Cleland animal park. It was so quiet there on a weekday afternoon. We spent 3.5 hours feeding wallabies and kangaroos. So many Joeys! We also did the koala encounter which was so fun. We had a little snack at the cafe (mediocre food but filled us up). Checked out Mt Lofty lookout before we drove back to Adelaide CBD and walked around the Botanical gardens a bit and got dinner at the Elephant British pub (just okay but good beer). Went back and fell right to sleep.    The next morning we woke up and got coffee at a little cafe around the corner from our Airbnb. We then headed to Morialta Nature Park. It was on my list and Sheryl said we could probably see koalas in the wild. We walked the first falls trail and saw koalas. It was such a beautiful morning out and we really enjoyed the walk. The kids wanted to check out the play area after so we walked there and they ran around. The park was so clean and well maintained. If I lived in Adelaide I would be there all the time. We had a reservation to feed kangaroos at Woodstock wines so we took the scenic route through the hills to get there. We did a tasting at Woodstock and then fed the sweet kangaroos. Woodstock also has a playground that entertained my 10 year old while we tasted (win win). We were hungry and the woman working at Woodstock recommended a little place on Main Street. We had lunch (and hot chocolate) and then headed to Port Wallunga. My daughter and I relaxed on the gorgeous beach while my husband and son threw a baseball. I wanted to do one more tasting and love Chenin Blanc so we headed to Coriole. It was on the hill and bit with beautiful gardens and views. We drove home after and decided to get Hot Pot for dinner since we had never had it and seemed to be everywhere. We went to the Hot Pot Guy because there seemed to be a lot of people and it was a few blocks from our Airbnb. They were patient and explained it all to us. We had a lot of fun eating and it was delicious.  The next morning we wanted to do another nature walk. We mapped to Brownhill Creek Rec Park and found Pickle in the Middle on the way for breakfast. It was healthy and delicious. We walked for about an hour and enjoyed the birds and scenery. Then we drove back to the CBD and did some shopping. Sheryl had suggested a local artists collective in the Arcade and a store that sells aboriginal art on home goods. I also bought opals from the opal mine store in Rundle. I would have never known to go to any of those stores without Sheryl‚Äôs suggestions. We bought some special items. We need to eat and the Central market was open. Thanks to the forum we went to Lucias. I almost wished I was cooking because all the food looked good. My son wanted to check out a park near our Airbnb so we went back to our Airbnb and the boys went to play. I texted Sheryl and asked for a good place to walk near the Torren River. She suggested the Gilberton swinging bridge. My kids loved it and it gave us a chance to see where people live. We also thought it was cool they used to have a swim club there. We then headed back to CBD and walked along the river there. Quick trip back to Dumpling King (kids were hungry but adults were still full from lunch so this was quick and easy) and Barbie bobas for the kids.    We loved Adelaide. It seems like such a livable city. Everything was so clean and well maintained. I‚Äôve never seen so many parks! I could have spent another week there just exploring the nature parks and drinking wine. The one thing we really wanted to do was rent bikes in the McLaren Vale but it seemed that the bike rental shop closed. I also didn‚Äôt see public bikes in Adelaide. Lots of scooters but with the kids I wanted bikes. I can‚Äôt recommend the Adelaide Greeters enough! We learned so much and got so much more out of the area. Sorry this is so long but I didn‚Äôt see a lot of info for people with tweens/teens so I hope this helps. Next time I come back I want to stay for a month! We were on the go all day but that‚Äôs how we travel. We were in bed by 8 every night so well rested every morning. Oh and coming in winter was great. Cool evenings but we had sunny days that required light jackets. That winter sun warmed us right up. I highly recommend a winter visit. On to Cairns! ,CalBear_02,Greater Adelaide,"San Francsico, CA"

Ok seems like it is recomended to allocate 6 hrs to Rottnest Isl .  So I imagine options are a tour or just the ferry ride there and back.

Alot of tours give departure time but no return time - just says return to original departure point- does that mean there are ferries going back & forth all day????  Best Tour company please.

Hi all    After some suggestions and did a search and found mostly old recommendations though some has been useful.    Partner and I along with our 16 month old boy are spending 4 nights in Port Douglas next month and wanted some suggestions if you dont mind.  We're specifically looking at Daintree and GBR suggestions. Note we'll have a hire car the whole time.    For the Daintree my gut feel is a tour probably isn't a great idea for us and the other guests and maybe just driving our selves is best ? Is that accurate and if so any suggestions on areas or places to see ?    For the GBR I'm very keen to go out and see it but mindful of the little guy on the long boat trip etc. Any tours you suggest might be ok for him ie shorter trips/larger boats so not too rocky. Can you take a pram on the boats ?    Also keen on any other suggestions such as food other places to check out etc    Thanks ! ,Miles B,Port Douglas,"Sydney, Australia"
I will be landing in Brisbane in early morning. Is is best to get AUD at an ATM using a debit card or going to a money exchange kiosk? Is there an ATM in the international terminal after going through customs? Would a bank give a better exchange rate?  Thanks. ,Janet R,Brisbane,"Phoenix, Arizona"

Hi - in 2019 we did the south loop from Perth (Margaret River Albany Esperance etc) - we will back in Perth next year (July) and this time would like to head north. Thought we might head up Green Head area then inland towards Wubin then back to Perth via Northam/York. Would appreciate any advice on must see/do's. Thanks ,Billy M,Perth,"Newcastle, Australia"
I know this has probably been asked ad nauseam but I keep finding conflicting information about the topic. I have rushed to book accomodation in Kings Canyon and then Uluru (in this order) and booked an SUV car (not 4wd). Am I going to be fine if I drive from AS to Kings Canyon then from Kings Canyon to Uluru and finally from Uluru back to AS? Can that be done through sealed roads only without taking too much of a detour?    Many thanks to the kind soul that can resolve this conundrum for me! ,Lorenzo C,Red Centre,
We would like to hike to Marion‚Äôs Lookout continue up to Kitchens Hut then down via Face Track Lake Wilkes track onto the Dove Lake Cct.    Is it easier (I don‚Äôt mean shorter) yo get to Marion‚Äôs Lookout to start the hike at Ronnie Creek on the Overland or Dove Lake Carpark and go via Wombat Pool track.    We have all day (weather permitted)    We have a spare afternoon is there another walk we could do for a few hours say from 2-6pm ? ,kidsb4me,Cradle Mountain-Lake St. Clair National Park,Hampton East...

In a couple of weeks I am flying from Brisbane to Sydney from then flying out 8 hours later to Europe. I would like to spend some time in the city between flights. I will have luggage with me. Is my best option to take a train from the domestic airport to Central station leave my luggage there then take a train from Central station to the international airport? If so can I buy the one ticket or do I need to purchase separate tickets? Thanks! ,Mark D,Sydney,Queensland...

Hi there  If I was to travel to Kangaroo Island between Christmas and New Years am I likely to find campsite for swags? No power needed. Is there anywhere you can camp near the beach? ,Katrina G,Kangaroo Island,

Hey all!    Due to a number of unfortunate and annoying flight changes/cancellations (thanks Qantas!) our time planned for Kangaroo Island got pretty short. Nonetheless although disappointed we are willing to stay posotive and make the most of it (cancellation is not an option).    We are flying in on Sep15 9am and flying out Sep17 3pm.    Given the timeframe which area of KI would you suggest to stay in so that we are close to wildlife and are able to visit main nature spots (restaurants are not the ultimate priority proximity to beaches would be really nice)? Basically seeing wild kangaroos through your window/porch is the childish dream. We will be renting a car.    Should I split my overnights between Kingscote & Western end? Stay in the north instead for both nights? Or just stay in Flinders Chase (e.g. Postman‚Äôs Cottage)?    Thanks! ,Karolis_LTU,Kangaroo Island,"Vilnius, Lithuania"

We will be staying at Wonga Beach near the Daintree & want to do a Daintree River cruise to see wildlife. Bit overwhelmed with the varying 'companies'. Some have 'quieter' electric motors. All the reviews look good. If someone has some current insight into & recommendations it would be appreciated.    Also:  Is early morning better?  2 hours better than 1 hour?  Are all the cruises from the southern side of Daintree or are some north of the river (we're also staying at Cape Trib)    Many thanks ,David G,Cairns,
So we will heading to Hobart on Thursday and plan to visit Mt. Wellington for sunrise either Friday morning or Saturday morning. Now I understand that the access road maybe closed due to bad weather (as apparently it is while I am tying these letters). So what would be our alternatives? Where could we park if the road is closed and how would we get to the lookout?    I also understand there are coach buses who serve the peak. Would they be allowed on the otherwise closed road? Do they run that early in the morning?    Last but not least: if the road is NOT closed what would be the appr. distance between the parking spots and the lookout?    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Tasmania,"Cologne, Germany"
Hi all  Some of you have helped me on my other questions so thank you for sharing your time and expertise.

So‚Ä¶.    Long story I‚Äôm back for my annual trip shortly and will do my bookend in Cairns    Last year I was very disappointed by Riley.    Just had a to and fro with Shangri La with whom I‚Äôve had at least 15 stays in the last 20 years. Unable to find a record of my Golden Circle account at the central level (email has changed) and curt reply due to a cancellation in 2017 when flights changed  I‚Äôm loathe to book there given I‚Äôm looking at close to 450pn for a club room.    My Hilton account has expired and their website is not letting me start a new account but it does look promising      So I‚Äôm open to suggestions one night stays late November quiet room clean maybe a club room.

so im in preliminary planning. In 3 weeks I think I'd like to visit Sydney Melbourne Cairns/Port Douglas and possibly Uluru. Is that possible? I can also make the trip longer than 3 weeks if necessary. Money is always a factor but this may be my only trip ever to Australia so I don't mind spending more since i won't be back (at least in the near future). It's a solo trip and I will not rent a car. How would you recommend dividing the days?I know it's a super basic question that has probably been asked many times before but i'm seen a range of opinions from online itineraries so would love to hear your thoughts. So far I really only planned sydney and melbourne and was thinking this:    day 1 - arrive in sydney (i live in east coast US so jetlag may be a problem by the way. i might have to add an extra day in sydney to account for jetlag recovery. I typically recover from jetlag pretty quick but furthest i've gone and recovered was cambodia)  day 2 - day trip to blue mountain  day 3 - sydney harbour/opera house/botanic garden/art gallery area  day 4 - manly beach or bondi beach (coastal walk to coogee) - take night bus to melbourne (i've seen 7:30 PM to 7:30 AM buses are typicaly offered). I've taken many night buses in my life and don't mind them.  day 5 - melbourne - Royal botanic garden/Shrine of remembrance/National gallery victoria  day 6 - melbourne - day trip to great ocean road?? As i said i wont have a car so don't know if it's possible.  day 7 - Old Melbourne gaol/melbourne museum/queen victoria market area  day 8 - flight melbourne to ?? or add a day in melbourne for phillips island or something else?    any advice is very appreciated. As I said I literally started planning yesterday so sorry for lack of knowledge but it's always better to get advice earlier rather than later. ,Michael R,Sydney,

Hello all. Need some advice on the overnight ferry we (four adults two children) plan to take in first week of June crossing from Geelong to Devonport. Can the sea be very rough during this period how safe is the ride with Spirit of Tasmania in early June?

My wife and I are arriving at the Cairns airport on the 18th and have a car reserved with Hertz. Our plans are to go to the Thala Beach Reserve for a few nights and then on to the Daintree Wilderness Lodge for two nights.    I just read that rental cars in Austrailia cannot be taken on Ferries. To my knowledge there is no way to reach the Daintree Wilderness lodge without taking the Daintree River Ferry.    Is this true? What other options would we have to get around while there? We could get a driver to the Thala Beach Reserve I am sure but how do we get to the Lodge from there? And would we be able to get around and see the Daintree National Park without a car?    This is a bit of a last minute fly-in-the-oinment for us. I would appreciate any advice. ,Aging Tramp,Daintree,"Arlington, Virginia"

Our March 2024 trip is planned. We are hoping to shift from Exmouth to Albany on the same day and found a Qantas/Rex Air combo that worked. However Qantas just kicked the LEA-PER flight back an hour which leaves us only a 45 minutes gap at Perth airport in the early evening. We will be carry-on only but...assuming flights are on time is there any prayer this is sufficient time to get from T4 (Q) to T2 (Rex)? Yes will have a Plan B but were just hoping to avoid the overnight/airport hotel dynamic and would appreciate the reality check. Thanks! ,PasadenaBunch,Greater Perth,"Pasadena, CA"
We are flying in to Cairns late morning in mid September. Our first destination (for 2 nights) is near Malanda in the Atherton Tablelands. I am trying to decide whether it is better to drive the longest route via Babinda boulders and Josephine Falls or take one of the shorter routes. We would like to see something on our way and are not sure whether these are the best options or there is something else you would suggest. Our interests are natural features swimming etc. The next day we want to explore the area including falls such as Millaa and Lake Eacham. On our way back the timing will mean that we can't stop anywhere. Any recommendations on the best falls or other places to visit would be appreciated.    Also we will have cooking facilities so want to pick up some food/alcohol supplies on our way including some fresh seafood. Where would be the best option on our route to do this? ,Skiwiflyer,Cairns,"Park City, Utah"

I will be visiting Tasmania for the second time in early December for 7 nights and was hoping to get some travel advice on my trip. As far I have only booked flights to Hobart and am yet to decide where to stay or visit. Unfortunately I can't drive so my options are very limited on where I can go. I was originally planning to book a multi-day tour around the island but these tours have gotten extremely expensive since I booked my flights. As I am a uni student on a budget I can't afford to book one of these tours anymore. I also planned to visit Cradle Mountains but accommodation has also gotten extremely expensive so I can't afford to visit Cradle Mountains either. Does anyone have any budget friendly tips on how I should go about my trip? I have done most of the touristy things in Hobart already and was hoping that this trip could be little off the beaten track so that I could explore new places. At this stage though I am thinking I might be best basing myself in Hobart and going from there. If it helps with answering my question I am very adventurous love nature enjoy hiking and the outdoors love good food and experiencing things that are a tad unique.    Thanks so much for your time and effort in answering my question. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ,Billie h,Hobart,

We will be arriving in Brisbane on 11 March 2024. Thinking of visiting and using Brisbane as a base until 18 March when we would fly to Sydney to board a cruise ship. So far this is what I'm thinking....Besides enjoying what Brisbane has to offer we would do a day trip along the river to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary a Sunshine Coast day trip to include Eumundi Markets and Noosa and a Gold Coast Day Trip down to Byron Bay. Another day go out to Moreton & the Bay Islands. Is 7 nights too much time in Brisbane? We are a bit older travelers and my husband is not keen on renting a car.    This is our 2nd time in Australia (the previous trip we visited Cairns & the GBR the Red Center Uluru and Alice Springs and Sydney). This trip will include Brisbane on to Sydney for 1 night and a South Pacific cruise and a cruise to Tasmania then Melbourne (where we plan to take a tour to the Great Ocean Road) and back to Sydney for a few days when we depart on April 13.

Hello everyone    We are in the early stages of planning a 2-week Northern Territory trip in late March/early April 2024. We have always wanted to visit Kakadu and Uluru and had planned to do so during the dry winter season but we will be in Southeast Asia next year and are thinking about including them as part of that itinerary given Darwin‚Äôs relative proximity from Singapore or Bali (compared to where we are in the U.S.). If the weather during late March/early April makes travel inadvisable during this time we can save it for another time. But we seem to be most excited about Australia our favorite travel destination. We have taken memorable trips to Tasmania Far North Queensland and most recently a fantastic road trip down the Coral Coast from Exmouth to the Margaret River area in Western Australia.    Our first question is whether the weather during this time will be so bad that we won‚Äôt be able to enjoy nature and the great outdoors that we have come to love about our experiences in Australia. We can handle the heat (we were in Exmouth in December) but worry about the kind of weather that could potentially ruin a trip‚Äîhigh chance of flooded roads being rained out for days or unbearably hot and steamy weather that would make say hiking and wildlife viewing unpleasant. During this time will the swimming holes and hot springs even be open?    Here is a first pass at an itinerary:    Day 1: Fly to Darwin from Singapore  Day 2: Fly to Alice Springs and drive to Glen Helen (Discovery Parks)  Day 3: Glen Helen  Day 4: Kings Canyon (Kings Creek Station)  Day 5: Uluru (Ayers Rock Resort ‚Äì Outback Hotel)  Day 6: Uluru  Day 7: Uluru  Day 8: Drive to Alice Springs for a late afternoon flight to Darwin  Day 9: Darwin to Litchfield National Park  Day 10: Litchfield National Park  Day 11: Katherine Area  Day 12: Katherine Area  Day 13: Kakadu (Cooinda Lodge)  Day 14: Kakadu  Day 15: Drive back to Darwin  Day 16: Fly to Bali    We will need to fill in the details but in terms of pacing what do you think? Any place we are leaving out that we should include (and conversely exclude)? Would appreciate any advice you may have.    Thank you! ,4quartets,Northern Territory,United States

Hello  could you please advise where to stop for two or three nights en route from Daintree (south of river) to Carnarvon to break the route in half (say at least 5+11 but better something like 7+9)?  Our itinerary before is Eungella - Mission Beach - Cape Tribulation - south of river for a crocodile boat trip. Our main interest is wildlife - we would like to see also some outback fauna such as red kangaroos or emus but that is probably not best done on this route. Any good wildlife (but wild not zoo or enclosures) location would do.  I was thinking Charters Towers for the Allied Rock Wallaby colony plus the fruit bat colony but maybe after over 2 weeks in Queensland already we might be already wallabied out (not really sure how it will go though...).  I was also advised to go to Atherthon tablelands but I am not sure how to grasp it given our interest(s) (and it actually adds time instead of breaking the route :D ).  Also one more question: I checked some campsites availability why is Carnarvon so popular?? It is more booked out than any other park I checked.  2WD hatchback and tent camping only.  Thank you. ,Asanoth,Queensland,
Hi  I am going on a cruise to Australia. The cruise has excursions to Cleland park and Healesville sanctuary. Unfortunately I can afford only one of them.    Which one would you choose - Cleland park or healesville sanctuary? I would like to get close to animals to pet and feed them.    Appreciate your help! ,Larisa B,,"Germantown, Maryland"
15 years ago during our 3 month family trip around QLD we inquired in person at the Townsville tourist info office in town who had lists of cheap accomodation on Magnetic. We got a 2 bed 'apartment' with kitchen which was attached to a private residence cheap & a fantastic base.    We're now travelling QLD sans kids wanting to visit Magnetic again & book ahead this time. All I can find on line are Stayz & Airbnb for big bucks. Would anyone know if these types of rentals still exist & where to find them? Thanks ,David G,Townsville,

We will catch bus from Launceston city to stay nearby hotel. Like to watch penguins. Must join a tour? Or you can just walk down beach and see little ones everywhere?

Hi  We like outdoors and adventure mid 40s with three teenage kids. Tried to maximise the variety of experiences with no one night stays and breaking up long drives with things to do and places to stay. This still feels rushed though! Aiming for summer 2023.

Hi all  Do you think this day plan is reasonable?    Will be travelling from Jurien Bay to Kalbarri August 30th.  Leave Jurien Bay travel to Coalseam Conservation Park for a couple of hours to see the wildflowers and then on to Kalbarri arriving 4ish.    The other plan was to just travel through Geraldton and Horrocks.    Many thanks  Veronica ,Veronica B,,
Hi  Has anyone been to Vincentia NSW which is a beach resort close to Jervis Bay? Is it a nice place to spend a weekend? Apart from the beaches what are the activities available there?

Hi everyone    We are planning to visit Rottnest on a Monday in November. We are planning to do the Rottness Express ferry package with bike rental from Freemantle .    However I'm not too sure how long we need on the Island and it looks like once you have booked a ferry time you can't move it.    We need to drive to the harbour in the morning (from South Yunderup) and leave our car there so could get there at 10-11 am without it being too much of a rush.    Thanks ,Claire,Western Australia,

We are planning a 5 week road trip in South Australia in Feb 24 and would like to incorporate the coastal route from Melbourne to Sydney Murray River and High Country and the Blue Mountains. We understand that some places in those areas were severely affected by the 2019/20 bush fires. We are wondering if there are still effects which impact on the landscape and exploring the area eg scenery access etc. Any advice and comments? Thank You. ,Lesley J,,"Bristol, United..."

Greetings! We will be visiting Melbourne (6 days) Cairns (3 days) and Sydney (3 days) this month end. I realize this is last minute trip with only couple of weeks out and we are trying to get our itinerary figured. Any feedback would be appreciated. This will be a trip with my 6 year old son. We will be staying at Grand Hyatt Melbourne and will have access to a rental car on all days (if needed).    Day-1: Short day Arrive at MEL from SYD. Federation Sq and Melbourne Museum;  Day-2: Flinders Street Station Sealife Aquarium OR Melbourne Zoo;  Day-3: Royal Botonical Gardens and Healesville Sanctuary;  Day-4: Phillip Island Nature Park - Koala Reserve and Penquin Parade;  Day-5: Drive Great Ocean Road;  Day-6: Depart to CNS.    Questions:  1. Is this itinerary practical? Will any day be too much or too little?  2. Any other must see that we could possibly replace on any of the day? I realize there is a ton more like Dandenong Ranges National Park Yarra Valley etc. but with limited time I need to be selective.  3. Recommendation for great ocean road drive.  4. Food recommendations - We are open to trying any or all exotic/ unique opportunities.  5. Between the zoo and the aquarium - which would you recommend?    Thank you in advance! ,NKAGAR2,Melbourne,Florida
We're just starting to consider a trip to Australia. Right now we'd focus on the SE ( Sydney to Melbourne & some spots around Melbourne like the GOR Mornington Peninsula Phillip Island) and the SW ( Perth Margaret River Albany Esperance) - no specific routes yet.    Would you recommend a spring trip (likely October) or a fall trip ( likely March) to explore these areas? Ocean swimming would be nice but not critical. I'm concerned about bush fires in fall but maybe there is as much of a risk in spring.    Thank you for any advice. ,smitten_kitten,,Canadian Rockies...
Hi all    First time visiting the snowy mountains for most of us here. We‚Äôre planning to stay in either the Lake Crackenback or Snowgate Motel. We also have elders and an entire family ranging from an infant to 60 years of age so I must ask:    1) How do we get to the chairlifts? Preferably the easiest for us to access the one above many people skiing or snowboarding around how much does this usually cost?    2) Our main goal here is to see and experience the snow what would be the best for us to do so with the most ease of access and have the best chance of seeing the thickest snow?    3) Any general tips and expectations for a big family of 10 (excluding accommodation; just the trip to the Snowy Mountains the chairlifts back down and seeing as much snow as we can)    4) Still exploring our options even if last minute what is the most affordable and convenient place to stay for a big family with elders and kids?    Just really confused where to start and how to find all this information as well.    Any help is appreciated TIA! ,JV,Snowy Mountains,"Brisbane, Australia"
I apologise if asked already but we will be in Sydney in the last week of October and want to do the bridge walk. All options are currently available but before booking we would like peoples opinion on the three options. We like the idea of the night walk (18:00 start) but wonder if the experience is greater during the day of perhaps a bit of both (twilight) is the best option.  Thanks in advance.

Hi there    I am going to ask this Q in both the Queensland / NSW forums given I am between places in each region. I am coming to Australia with my husband for the first time in a few weeks - we will be spending most of our time in Sydney and the surrounding area but have a few days free to travel further afield. I am very torn between the Daintree Rainforest / Port Douglas area vs. Byron Bay.    Reason being I feel like in Sydney we will have more of a cosmopolitan city experience then we venture to the Blue Mountains - so I would love to experience beautiful beaches and ideally rainforest. However I worry we are venturing too far for this if we go to DR / PD - and perhaps we can have a similar experience in and around Byron Bay? Equally I cannot get a read on Byron Bay as reviews seem to be mixed!    We are a newly married couple in our 30s - we love luxurious spots kicking back exceptional food and wine and are open to light hiking and some activity but I am not terribly adventurous (i.e. I will hike kayak snorkel sail but you won't find me surfing or zip lining!).    Thoughts?    THANK YOU!  Shelby ,Trip297390,New South Wales,

We are a family of four with two young adults and will be visiting Cairns for GBR in Feb 2023. We are debating whether we should try scuba diving (no experience) or snorkeling. And there are so many companies out there that don't know which one to pick. Greatly appreciated if someone can give us advice or a recommendation on which tour to choose.

We are due to arrive in Sydney next week and have many domestic flights. We purchased domestic flights last December on Qantas and they have changed some of our flights to different airlines - Sunstate and Alliance I think) We will each check a bag on all flights.    We are flying Sydney to Hervey Bay via Brisabane- 90 minutes-is that enough time or too much?    Hervey Bay to Cairns via Brisbane - is 1 hour enough here? Seems like a very small airport but I have no experience.    Cairns to Ayers rock- 90 minutes or do I need 2 hours yes returning a car at the airport.    Ayers rock to Cairns- We will need to return car and check bags- this I have read more like 2 hours even though small airport. Is this the right amount of time?    SYD international- 2.5-3 hours is what I am seeing.    Thank you for the information! ,Northwestern,,
Our family of 5 (2 adults + 3 kids) are on a road trip straight from Melbourne Airport to Mornington Peninsula where we will be staying for 4 nights in Dec 2023. Then I thought of going over to Phillip Island for a night or two with the Penguin Parade as a highlight before driving back to Melbourne City (and maybe stopping by Puffing Billy and cherry picking).    However after googling I soon realized that there is no ferries that take cars from Mornington Peninsula to Cowes Phillip Island.  I saw a Port Western Ferry that only takes passengers from Stony Point in Mornington to Cowes.    what options do I have?  If I leave our car in Mornington then how do we get about in Penguin Parade?  And if not then the only way is to get back to Melbourne the same route I used to get to Mornington? Seems like a little bit wasted!    Appreciate all your advice.  Thanks. ,tanshuyin,Melbourne,Penang Island...

We will be in Adelaide in 2 weeks! Coming from Los Angeles (2 adults 2 tween/teens). We know it will be cold but that's ok because it's hot in LA and will be nice to have some cool weather. We are staying in the center of Adelaide. Right now I have us exploring Adelaide one day going to the Adelaide Hills and checking out the Cleland Wildlife Park and possible wine tasting if we have time and we have one more full day. I was planning to bike in the Barossa Valley and wine taste but the Fleurieu Peninsula looks like fun. What would be the better location with kids/teens and why? Obviously weather will help us determine what we do but any advice is appreciated. We go to Port Douglas after and end our trip in Sydney ,CalBear_02,Greater Adelaide,"San Francsico, CA"

Hi all    We are a family of 5 (husband & I with our 3 kids aged 14 11 & 8yo).    We would like to rent a car upon touching down Melbourne Airport to get to Mornington Peninsula for a few days.  After that we would be staying in Melbourne CBD for about 2 weeks.  So I'm hoping car rental pickup would be from Melb Airport and drop off would be Melb CBD.    We would most probably be bringing 2 big luggage with us and with 5 people in the car I am still scratching my head to see which car can fit our family plus our luggages while keeping it still economical.    Most of the sedan cars can sit 5 but has very little boot space and I doubt it can fit 2 big luggage.    And also which car rental company is good and yet not too expensive.    Would appreciate if somebody can advise me.  Thanks! ,tanshuyin,Melbourne,Penang Island...

I'm confused about what national park pass to purchase for my 3 week holiday in Tasmania with friends. Three of us initially do the Three Capes Walk using the boat transport to the start provided. Then we hire a car to go to Mt Fields National Park. After that we meet up with an Australian friend and will be transported in his car to visit several other national parks including Cradle mountain. It seems that a backpackers pass is needed for the Three capes since we arrive in a boat. Then a vehicle pass will be needed for Mt Fields but we wont be able to transfer that pass to the friends private vehicle for the remainder of the trip. Grateful for help. ,JackyChallis,Tasmania,"Waikanae, New..."

Hi    I was considering travelling to Darwin and other parts of Australia after travelling south East Asia (I am from the UK so seems worth extending the trip as it's so much closer). However due to timing of when I was going to Asia it would mean I end up in Darwin around December or January time which I know is the wet season.    I read that roads can be closed and cyclones can be around but I have always wanted to go to Darwin primarily for the wildlife animals and amazing scenery but seeing some posts about access to kakadu being restricted in this time I was wondering if anyone could help me decide whether the the trip be worth it and should I skip this stop and go straight to another city? ,Juliette A,Darwin,

Hi everyone!    I've been reading a lot of great information on these boards over the last while and the time has come to ask for specific comments on my own planned itinerary.    My wife and I are in our early 30s; we are pretty active (enjoy hiking outdoor scenery in general) and like good food & wine. In general we aren't city people and would much prefer beautiful countryside and scenery! We are well used to road trips also and generally enjoy that form of travel. This is part of longer term travel so we will be trying to keep costs down as much as possible (happy to stay in motels airbnb not eat out every night etc.). Have budgeted to be able to splash out on great big ticket items though like Great Barrier Reef tours Fraser Island tour Whitsundays cruise/flight etc.    Have decided to focus on south and east as it ticks most of our boxes in terms of what we enjoy. Trying to balance seeing as much as possible and also leaving enough down time that we won't get exhausted is difficult but this is early in our travels and we will be heading to Fiji for a week afterwards to relax so hopefully it will be ok!    At the minute we are making an assumption that we will be back to Australia in 2027 for the Rugby World Cup so purposely leaving out the big cities (Melbourne Brisbane) and the Red Centre as we will plan to explore those when we are back. Would consider reducing Sydney by a night or two also to have more time on road trip.    I've set out a draft itinerary and some comments below and I suppose I'm just looking for some general comments/critique on the places I've included/left out route structure in general etc. Happy to get into any specific areas of it in subsequent posts if anything needs clarifying. Thanks a million in advance and I welcome any comments!    17 Oct - arrive in Melbourne from Europe  1 nights near airport to sleep and recover from jet lag  3 nights on Great Ocean Road (collect rental car and don't do much first day maybe as far as Bell's Beach - will probably still be recovering from flight) - other nights in Apollo Bay/Port Campbell  3 nights in Grampians NP (Hall's Gap)  Return to Melbourne and fly to Cairns (rent car for 4/5 days)  2 nights in Port Douglas (Quiksilver tour)  2 nights in Daintree  3 nights in Cairns  18 nights road trip to Sydney (would consider a campervan for this section as I think it lends itself well to the route i.e. lots of one night stops) - preliminary planned stops are Mission Beach Townsville Airlie Beach (2 nights - see Whitsundays on cruise or flight or both) Rockhampton Bundaberg Hervey Bay/Rainbow Beach Fraser Island (2 day/1 night tour) Noosa Heads Burleigh Heads Byron Bay Coff's Harbour Nambucca Heads Forster Pokolbin or somewhere in wine region (2 nights) Katoomba (2 nights)  3 nights in Sydney  21 Nov - fly Sydney to Fiji ,Patrick K,,"Galway, Ireland"

How should I plan 6 days Gold Coast? I am arriving on 21 st Dec and will be leaving on 27th ,Rahulkumar Shah,Gold Coast,"Ahmedabad, India"
With helpful advice from this forum a few weeks ago my wife and I have scheduled our whirlwind two-week visit to Australia starting in Sydney then Uluru and finally Palm Cove before flying to New Zealand for a family wedding.    We are now trying to make a final decision about lodging in Sydney for 5 nights. I have booked a room at the Radisson Blu Plaza. The room's a decent size has some seating in addition to a desk chair and is at a good rate. I like the location fairly close to Circular Quay. However we are considering any of three Meriton Suites facilities as an alternative to get more living space and to facilitate having a small breakfast in our room each day. We can get a one bedroom suite some with balcony for the same or less than we will pay at the Radisson at the Campbell Sussex or Kent Street Meriton. All of the Meritons appear to add 10-20 minutes walking distance to get to Circular Quay compared to the Radisson. Obviously we will not be spending all our time at Circular Quay but I picked that just to compare locations. Do you have any thoughts about the relative merits of these alternatives location or otherwise? I know one of the Meritons is near a shopping area but that's of little interest to us. I'm sure that we will be doing ferries the Rocks the Opera House the Harbour Bridge probably the Botanical Garden while in Sydney. We also would like to be staying fairly close to restaurants.  Thank you. ,Rick S,Sydney,Saint Paul...

Hi  I will be visiting Cradle mountain in April try to search for Shuttle Bus' Schedule for Dove lake.  Only info i got that it runs every 20 mins ... but I can't find when would the 1st and last bus be.  (I wish to be there until late for sunset and visit there again in early morning the earlier the better. Then depart for other town.)  Also If somehow i miss the last bus is it possible and safe to walk to the visitor center?    Thanks in advance. ,panisajay,Cradle Mountain-Lake St. Clair National Park,
Hello! We are interested in visiting resale shops for hard goods and some light clothing shopping. There seems to be a cluster Oxford and Crown. I‚Äôve also read in reviews that Paddington has good shopping and we are interested in surf wear. Finally I‚Äôd like to walk a couple/ few of miles for exercise and see architecture and pretty homes.    We are staying at Marriott Quay and meeting a group at the Eye mid-afternoon. Will start out in the morning. Where should we start and end along Oxford? Bus or Uber? Thanks so much! ,GeckoMom,Sydney,Santa Barbara...

We are looking for help in choosing our hotel for our stay in Brisbane. We want to be in the CBD area and have booked the Grand Chancellor but are having 2nd thoughts (mainly due to the apparent uphill road back to the hotel) the hotel itself seems very nice any feedback on it would be appreciated. Our dates are 15/10-18/10 and would appreciate any feedback from those who have stayed in the vicinity. Our budget is approx ¬£150/$270 per night. Thanks. ,ukdebdow,,United Kingdom

Just a casual Sunday evening blurb about some local restaurant news.    A fairly recent opening from the Love Tilly Group that brought us the prominent wine bars Dear Sainte Eloise and namesake Love Tilly Devine comes the Italian trattoria Palazzo Salato. Located in Clarence St on the site of the former Redoak Beer Caf√© this concept comes with an equal focus on their 500 strong wine list and the food to complement that list. The sister property to Ragazzi certainly heats up what is becoming quite the competitive space with the likes of De Vine Vini Divini and Little Felix all within a few blocks of each other.  https://www.palazzosalato.com/    Two forum favourites (plus a diner from Central Coast) are offering a Winter Dining Prix Fixe Menu at a 50% discount. The Fenwick Ripples Chowder Bay and Lagos Cucina in a promotion from their parent Sydney Restaurant Group are offering this deal until the end of August.  https://www.sydneyrestaurantgroup.com.au/whats-on-1/winter50offspecial    A long awaited replacement for Automata has finally arrived. It come in the form of Longshore by the Hartyard pair Jarrod Walsh and Dorothy Lee  a seafood focused modern Australian restaurant which has an unusual combination of A La Carte 5-Course Tasting Menu and a 10-Course Snack Degustation.

Hello! Would like to tap on the wealth of knowledge from all you NSW experts.  We (hubby myself & our 11yr girl) will be in Sydney from the last week of Nov to 1st week Dec. I‚Äôm planning a 4 day self drive along the Grand Pacific route. We are huge foodies would love some time on the beaches and would love to spot of whale watching (if still in season) and/or net booming (never heard of this until I started my research a month ago). We love exploring small towns even better if there are good local cafes bakeries artisanal small producers and the like.  We arrive on 26/11 morning and will likely rent a car and head out. As we would have just gotten off an overnight flight I think it would probably be prudent to just take an easy 1-2 hour drive to our accommodations. I‚Äôm looking at Kiama / Lake Illawarra / Wollongong. Is this area a good one to base ourselves? I‚Äôm also wondering if I should do the full 4 days in 1 Airbnb or if anyone has a good recommendation for a nice farmstay somewhere along the route I‚Äôm happy to break it up to 2 days each. We live in the city and my girl would absolutely love a farmstay experience feed the animals harvest some fruits etc.  Looking forward to all the tips and advice I can get from you guys thanks very much in advance! ,FoodieFamily,New South Wales,
Hi everyone. This will be my fourth trip to Australia and my husband‚Äôs first. Husband is an expert surfer. I am trying to cram everything we need to do into two weeks and it is extremely difficult. Currently I have a rough itinerary of five nights Sydney (maybe a night or two in Newcastle will take some of these) three nights Byron Bay three nights Noosa and two nights Cairns because everyone needs to see the GBR once in their life.    We have friends scattered all over the place from Melbourne to Noosa so I feel pressured to cover all those cities and I feel like a donkey for already dropping Melbourne I need to add it back but heck I want to tone it down and not be so stupid amazing race. I know it looks easy just drop Byron for Melbourne but there are two breaks in that area albeit remote that are on the list to check out. I will be grateful for all of your suggestions and ideas. Thank you in advance. ,KK_Melia,,San Diego...
Hello  we were to visit Queensland OOL to OOL for 25 days in July and August but needed to postpone our trip. We will probably start around September 1st meaning that with 25ish days we will overlap with spring holidays.  Our main (pretty much sole) interest is wildlife. We are on budget very tight budget on Australian terms tent camping and self cooking all the way through renting a hatchback.  We plan to visit Brisbane - Noosa - Hervey Bay area for about a week Eungella and Cape Hillsborough for a few days Mission beach Girringun and maybe Atherthon higlands for a few days and of course Daintree. On the way back we might go through Charters Towers Carnavoron and if there is time Lamington and Springbrook. It is quite a lot to cover in less than 4 days I know.  Anyway I assume when we get to Daintree the holidays will have started so I wanted to ask how bad is it with crowds there - I especially would like to avoid crowds of shouting children. I would think we would like to spend 3 full days north of the river: We love rainforests and like to enjoy calm walks looking for little creepers and in Australia also hopefully tree mammals and birds of paradise.    My questions are as I will need to book in advance given the spring break does Daintree get much more crowded with spring holidays and weekends and are 3 full days (4 nights) at the North Beach campsite sufficient/not too much?  Also any tips are appreciated: We only decided today we can go and our plan for the original trip was not too polished yet.  Thank you. ,Asanoth,Daintree,
Hi everyone  I've been so disappointed to find some lovely 1 x bedroom apartments with balconies and lovely views only to read through all the reviews to find that there's so much noise from construction sites nearby or the train line. I have been to Australia before but have not stayed in Brisbane and so I have been looking in South Bank/West End and the CBD. We also have a personal dislike of showers over baths and so I have eliminated apartments that don't have walk in or separate showers. We will have done a road trip from Melbourne Mornington Peninsula and Sydney before reaching Brisbane and so we will need a parking for our hired car. Any suggestions will be welcomed. Thank you ,Bernadine70,Brisbane,"Johannesburg, South..."

Hi all    I am travelling to Australia for the first time with my husband at the very end of August for 9 days/nights. We are flying in and out of Sydney as the city is the focus of our trip however I do want to take advantage of flying to essentially the other side of the world and do some exploring - BUT - without cramming in so much that I don't feel we have time to fully appreciate our present.    Out of 9 nights how many would you recommend dedicating to staying in Sydney to truly get a proper feel for the city? I know some will say you could spend weeks there and still not be bored we are not mega tourists in the sense that we need to see every museum and every exhibition but we would like to immerse ourselves in the city and hit the highlights whilst feeling unhurried. I am open to doing some day trips from Sydney as well where it makes sense.    Since we fly into and out of Sydney I am thinking we spend the first 4 nights there head elsewhere for 3-4 nights and then come back to Sydney at the end of the trip. I have done a lot of research and digging around this forum and the most interesting places for us seem to be:    - Blue Mountain  - Hunter Valley  - Byron Bay  - Whitsundays  - Lord Howe Island  - Cairns / Port Douglas / Daintree Rainforest    My question is - what are the strongest from the above in terms of cannot miss places and which would you suggest overnighting in? My natural inclination is to think that it makes most sense to day trip to Blue Mountain and Hunter Valley perhaps spending some nights in Byron Bay OR Whitsundays OR Cairns OR Lord Howe Island.    About us - we are a newly married couple in our 30s and we love great food exceptional wine being outdoors (more so in the way of beaches luxury cabins in the woodlands snorkelling light hiking - not anything too too taxing or adventurous; more so speaking for myself!) and soaking up nature and culture. We are quite chilled and like to explore but do not like days crammed with jumping from Point A to Point B to Point C. As I said unless it cannot be missed we are not fussed about museums / art though open to booking something at the Opera House.    If helpful we will be staying at the Four Seasons for the first leg of our trip possibly returning at the end or perhaps trying something more boutique for a different experience.    Many many thanks in advance!    Shelby ,Trip297390,Sydney,

Hi all we will be coming across on the SOT in December bringing our car. We hope to drive around the island in 2-3 weeks. Food history and nature are all high on our list of things to see.    This is our draft itinerary:    Day 1: Arriving at 5:30am Devonport drive to Stanley stopping at-Fossil Bluff Table Cape Boat Harbour and finally The Nut. Check in the. Head to Godfrey beach to see penguins returning?    Day 2: Drive to Cradle Mountain walk around Dove Lake. Night tour at Devils Cradle. Stay o/n.    Day 3: drive to Stahan stopping at Montezuma Falls Henry Dunes (?) watch The ship that never was. Stay o/n    Day 4: Gordon River Cruise and Hogarth Falls. Stay 2nd night.    Day 5: West Coast Wilderness Railway from Queenstown at 10am-2:30pm. Iron Blow Lookout Nelson Falls. Stay O/N at Lake St Clair    Day 6: walk around Lake St Clair Wall in the Wilderness Russell Falls continue in to Hobart.    This is where I‚Äôm lost‚Ä¶obviously there‚Äôs lots to see in Hobart itself so possibly Day 7. Then do I stay in Bruny Island or day trip out? Again with Port Arthur do I stay in Hobart or somewhere closer??    From there we will head up to Coles Bay Binnalong Bay then on to Launceston before heading back to Devonport.    Any advice is much appreciated‚Ä¶I like to fit everything in if possible. Am I missing anything so far?? Haven‚Äôt mapped out the second half yet.    Thank you!! ,Lucky M,Tasmania,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi kind forum members I wonder if I can ask for some advice please due to changed travel plans.    We are coming to Aus from the UK in Feb/March 2024 as a couple of retirees but a newly diagnosed eye condition for myself (the designated driver) has drastically altered our plans while there exploring the East Coast.    We now have to rely on air travel between destinations and as such need to sort out a couple of road transfers. These will be between Brisbane and Byron Bay and then from Byron Bay to Noosa the other transfers we will pick up as shuttles at airports to booked hotels.    Would anyone be able to offer any recommendations for a reasonably priced transfer company between those 2 destinations please?    it's such a shame that we have had to change our plans of driving up the East Coast but worse things in life happen so we just have to adapt I'm sure we will have a great first visit to Australia!! ,M C,,"London, United..."

Hello I did check the top questions but didn't see any specific answers to this question. We do like the flexibility of having our own car to tour Barossa Valley and a few wineries but then again it might be more relaxing to let someone else drive and handle logistics.

I see the canola is starting to glow so herewith my annual visiting the canola message. I post this because I have a number of farming friends who are thoroughly fed up with having random strangers traipsing through their canola paddocks in a bid for that Instagrammable photo. I even know of an instance where a family drove quite a distance into the farm climbed the fence and set up a collapsible picnic table and took much persuading to leave.    As the canola comes into bloom we have the perennial issue of tourists wanting to see the fields and take photos. Unfortunately this can lead to problems for farmers and other road users.  Please please please stay out of the canola fields- and tell your friends as well!  As I drive in the rural surroundings of my home at this time of year I often see a lovely yellow canola field with a rental car parked next to it and tourists wandering through the crop presumably taking photos. Unfortunately the nature of the road and the traffic means that I am often unable to turn around and speak to them to let them know that what they are doing is rude in the extreme as well as illegal trespass.  If you see a canola field and want photos take as many as you like from the outside of the fence. This field is the farmer's private property and his livelihood. Trampling down plants and shaking the seed heads off the others you brush past (canola seeds are very fragile) reduces the farmer's income. In addition it is very easy to spread diseases into the canola that will kill it or severely reduce its yield.  Just because a gate is open does not mean it's an invitation to enter. This is for the farmer's convenience not yours. If you open your front door to let the breeze in you don't expect passers by to just walk in.  Farmer friends have told me that often they even have tourists driving right up to their houses and wandering around as if it's a public park.  Please park safely. Be sure that your car is completely off the road and don't park just around a curve where you may cause an accident as you drive away just as an unsuspecting motorist doing 110kph comes around the curve and finds you slowly pulling out into the road.  If gates are open this is not an invitation for you to enter. This is for the farmer's convenience not yours. Please stay out.  How would you feel if tourists waltzed into your garden and home trampling the plants and knocking over your treasures so they could get a great holiday photo?  Look but DO NOT TOUCH and STAY OUT OF THE PADDOCKS! ,YorkFoodie,,rural West Aussie

Our flight home from Auckland (following a Sydney to Auckland cruise) will go from AKL to SYD to LAX. The AKL-SYD leg is Air New Zealand and the SYD-LAX leg is Delta. They are not on the same ticket and do not code share (based on my research). The layover at SYD is 4 hours. The plan is to pick up our luggage following the AKL-SYD leg go through customs and then come back around through security for the SYD-LAX leg. Not ideal but necessary to get premium economy for all legs of the flight for my very tall spouse. I was confident of the process and that we would have enough time - now that the flights are booked I am second guessing my judgement. Hoping for reassurance from the experienced travelers in this forum but welcome any and all advice. Thanks! ,KSL,,Michigan
Hi all    My wife myself and our 2 year old daughter are making our first trip to Sydney (from New Zealand) in 6 weeks time and I am hoping for some advice and tips on how to make the most of our trip.    We have booked our flights already and are flying to and from Australia on the Emirates A380 which we are quite happy about as the entertainment should be good and will help keep our active child happy (any tips for flying on this plane with a 2 year old? we are quite nervous about that as its her first flight).    We have also just booked out accomodation at Adina Apartment Hotel Sydney Town Hall as it looks to be in a good location (central and close to a public transport stop with plenty of different options. Any feedback on this choice? our choices for 1 bedroom apartments within our price range were quite limited.    We are now looking into transport we will take public transport everywhere we go as we will not rent a car. What is the best way to do this for a family of three? bearing in mind we will have our daughters stroller with us also maybe trains are the only option? should we get a transport card and if so is there different options? we are close to the Town Hall light rail station I think we can get a few different trains from their and get to most places from there without to many transfers?

My husband and I will be staying in Darwin on the final leg of a one-month Australian holiday in August before we fly back to London. It will be my first time in Oz but for my husband this is a return visit. He worked for 4 months in the Novatel (Atrium Hotel) on the Esplanade while on a gap year back in 1990 and has always wanted to return. We'd hoped to stay at the Atrium initially but reviews on all of the travel sites aren't great. Should we believe what we read? Ideally we'd like to stay in a city centre apartment during our 6-night visit and are happy to spend ¬£¬£¬£ to find the right location in a clean quiet well-serviced building with a pool. We are currently looking at the Ramada Suites by Wyndham the Argus Apartments or a Garden Bungalow in the Palm City Resort but are open to suggestions. I've noticed that most of the Darwin Airbnbs are in the same hotel/apartment blocks that you find on Booking.com etc. We'd love to hear recommendations from seasoned Darwin visitors and locals on where to stay to make our visit extra special. ,DeiseGirl15,Darwin,"London, United..."

So my questions are:  - What are some fun things to do in Perth on weeknights? I'm a bit of a foodie so I'd love anywhere that's friendly to solo diners.  - On the 3 days that I have off what are some good day trips I can take outside of Perth? Should I hire a car?

We are in our late 70‚Äôs but fit for our age  active and reasonably alert.  Flying from Sydney to Adelaide for a couple of tourism days then plan to take the Sealink bus down the peninsula and catch the ferry renting a car upon arrival for 3-4 days. So Then the adventure takes a dark turn‚Ä¶ as we have no idea what to do!    Is there a choice of ferry destinations to choose from? Assume the car rental company KIC is there at the entry ports?    Then where to stay and where to go for our adventure? We like the rustic rural areas best and like nature wildlife viewing and the such. Assume we would stay at 2 different locales as we see the island? Where is recommended? And no camping obviously for us!    I see that night driving is a no no- fine with us geezers!    And we do like decent food and lodgings‚Ä¶    Thanks in advance for ideas!

Has anyone done the trip and can recommend the best route? We have only ever driven the A8 all the way to Ballarat so haven't driven any of the routes further North.    Also if you have any recommendations for an overnight on the way it would be appreciated! ,keedm002,Victoria,"Adelaide, Australia"
Hello we are planning on traveling around Tasmania from March to May 2024. We would like to visit Bruny Island during this time. Could someone advise if there are RV parks available. our van is fully compliant. Thanks. ,Cosmopolitan562518,Bruny Island,
We are from the Northern Hemisphere so we're not quite sure about high temperatures in March and whether or not taking the Kuranda train first and the Skyrail second or vice versa would be best since neither are air conditioned. Looking for experiences specific to train or Skyrail being too hot in the middle of March. We think we'll do the Gold upgrade in order to keep a train car cooler since it will have less people. What does anyone think about this? ,Bkbak,Cairns,"Tempe, Arizona"

I arrive 930am and have 1 night in Cairns and departing 12pm the following day for Japan.    I dont want to commit to a tour in case flight changes however after options for things to do    Would a DIY trip to Fitzroy Island be nice? Last time I hired an elec bike and cycled to Trinity beach so could consider another DIY bike trip if anyone has any ideas? Although slightly leaning towards Fitzroy as it looks beautiful. It will be mid September.    No budget constraints ,mandarin2809,Cairns Region,"Adelaide, Australia"
Hello We are a couple and spending our New Years Eve in Sydney this year. I will be reaching Sydney at 3 PM on 31st Dec '23 and I was looking for options to consider to watch Fireworks. From what I have read so far int he forums we will have to camp way early in the morning for the free sites. I am willing to spend between AUD 250-500 / person for the experience. I can see a few cruises at around AUD500. However I came across this one cruise which is around AUD270 (Greek New Years Eve Darling Harbour) by Dockside Group on Eventbrite.    1. Any reason this is half the price in comparison to other cruises something I am missing out ?    2. Also need recommendations on which vantage point should I go to if I am willing to spend AUD 250-500/person and can start queuing up by 5 PM with the best fireworks view    3. Any other cruises/boats I can go for in the lower price range of my budget at around AUD300    Thanks in advance ,Shreyans B,Sydney,

Hi All  My partner and I are travelling and staying for 2 nights next April(24) in Pokolbin. My question would be should we join one of the many winery tours or use the Hop on Hop off bus service and go to the wineries ourselves?  I think 3 wineries will be our limit but am unsure how it works if we visit the cellar doors without the tours organising it and any associated costs etc...  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I want to spend 3 or 4 nights on KI. I will be coming from Adelaide. I understand there is a bus from Adelaide to Port Jarvis where I get a Ferry which goes to Penshaw. Is there a Shuttle to Kingscote? I will stay in Kingscott and will not have a rental car. Are local tours available thru the TI office or a tour company on the Island? Most tours from Adelaide want to only spend one or two days on KI and I want to stay 3-4 days and not be rushed cramming everything into one or two days. I would like names of shuttle buses to get from Penshaw to Kingscott so I can book in advance and tour company as well. Is there a shuttle bus that goes to various sites on the island? Appreciate any help in putting together my trip. Thanks ,Keechie,Kangaroo Island,"Saint Helens, Oregon"
A bit of advice please for regular visitors to Western Australia where our daughter son-in-law and young grandsons live.    Mrs. dande & I currently have eVisitor (subclass 651) Visas. We are due to return to WA on 6th September and with our current visas cannot enter the country after 10th September.    I do appreciate we can officially enter on 6th September and stay for three months but wonder if it would be wiser to apply for new Visas?    I don‚Äôt want Immigration to think we are entering the country at the last minute simply to extend the validity of the Visas.    I would welcome for and against views. Thanks. ,dande49,,Sanur Kauh...
Hi. Need your opinion regarding the GOR part of my trip. Planning to stay 2 nights at the same place as will be too troublesome to keep unpacking with kids and seniors in the trip.

We have been reasonably regular visitors across the ditch costs about the same as a trip to Auckland and we like foreign languages. Last time we decided we had paid too much for a rental car to sit parked. This time we thought we would try using transport.    We got the train/bus combination from Brisbane to Harvey Bay.    When booking appartments I would ask how to get there from the bus station. Oh the bus drops you off but you arrange it first.  So go back to the superhelpful Queensland rail people. (Must be most helpful call centre Ive dealt with. They said ring the contractor Wide bay transport here the number  Rang them. Sorry mate thats only route we dont do  Go back to Queensland rail. They checked Sorry we dont do that anymore. Could be some taxi hanging around or someone will ring one.    So we get the train. Great ride. Folk getting on with more bedding than required for a camping trip and settling in for ride to Townsville and some obscure game between Cowboys and Eels.    If somehad a crate of chickens we coud have pretended we were crossing the Ghobi. Would we do this trip again? Too right! Loved it.    So we get to Marybough. Loaded into Wide Bay transport bus. Should have just asked the driver.    Get to depot. Stockland bus area is like movies set in a moon base. No taxi hanging around.  Dont worry mate just dial 1300....... or something. Ive still got a NZ sim card. How many digits first?    Driver rings. Shows us txt confirmation. Dissapears just us and another older couple on the moon base.  Taxi arrives. Doesnt know who his pick up was or where hes going but likes the other couples trip and takes them. Promises to check another cab coming!  15 minutes later one dully arrives.  White Crest appartment on Esplanade please.  Wheres that  !  Seems hes new to taxi driving    In the end I pull it up on phone find directions and sit next to him so he can hear it!    Going back the appartment mgr rings cab. Driver knows wsy but it was $5 more expensive. ,NZMike57,,"Christchurch, New..."
Hello guys!!!  With my husband we wd like to rent a Motorhome in Perth for 15 days for a Road trip.    Our interests are Snorkel Beach Little Trekkings and Landscapes.    -What is the best time of the year for this? (we were thinking beg Nov?)    -Any itinerary sugestions (Hopefully ard abt 2.000km in total). We were thinking driving for 2/3 days to visit the north and then drive to the south (margaret river esperance etc) for the rest of the trip. Is that a good idea?    Many many thanks we are a bit confused so ur help wd be appreciated!!! ,beatriz943,Western Australia,"Santiago, Chile"
Finally - after years of planning and numerous delays (Covid parents health issues etc) we are making our first trip to Australia next month. I decided to take a chance by staying in Potts Point at Spicers rather than the usual CBD hotel. Our itinerary is: Sydney for 2 days - Uluru - Port Darwin - and back to Sydney for 3 days. Bopping around a little I admit - but we are covering the top items on our bucket list.    So I'm unsure as to some things. My readings indicates that some think Potts Point is a seedy area but others say it's a trendy place with lots of cafes and restaurants. What is the balance here? How safe in general will it be to walk around? What are the best walks in the area? Are there areas I should avoid? Must sees especially off the beaten path? ,BarkingSparrow,New South Wales,Indianapolis...
Just FYI for overseas tourists contemplating cruises within Australia eg Kimberly. Worth reading especially wrt onboard isolation requirements. Insurance anecdotally only compensates a fraction of the daily cost if one is placed in isolation and misses excursions for example. Best know before you go.    Companies say they follow government guidelines but it's hard for overseas travelers to find them. Link downloads a PDF. Or you can Google Eastern Seaboard and Western Australia Cruise Protocols.

Traveling the beginning of November to Melbourne for 4 nights. Looking for a hotel that is conveniently located to transportation and attractions as we won't have a car. Would prefer a hotel with a separate sitting room. Worried about jet lag and having one of us wide awake and unable to sleep and wanting to sit and read or something. Don't care if we have a kitchen or not. Laundry facilities would be nice as well. Budget - want to keep it less than $450 AUD per night if possible. ,Carolyn K,Melbourne,"Cleveland, Ohio"
I'm going to the Supercar event (by car) this coming Sunday (Jul 30) and am a little bit confused over where to park. I have seen suggestions on various websites to enter either via Gates A or D both off Ferrers Road - the supercars website isn't what I'd call expansive or particularly helpful in their parking information.    Can anyone who has been to a supercars event there elaborate on which gate to use and whether or not to expect traffic jams in the vicinity - I plan to get there early Sunday morning.

Hi    It's our first time visiting Australia (traveling with my partner). We are staying for just over 3 weeks from 29 October ‚Äì 21 November. So far I'm thinking:    ‚Äì 2 nights stopping along the way to the Pinnacles Desert and then getting to Kalbarri  ‚Äì 2 nights in Kalbarri  ‚Äì 2 nights near Coral Bay  ‚Äì 3 nights in Exmouth and visiting Cape Range National Park      ‚Äì 2 or 3 nights Esperance  ‚Äì 2 nights near Albany or Porongurup  ‚Äì 3 nights Margaret River  ‚Äì 1 night near Perth with a visit to Rottnest Island      As you can see there is a gap in my itinerary and I'd appreciate any feedback.    Is it worth driving all the way to Karijini for a 1 or 2 night stay in November (we also aren't too keen on bouldering or scrambling)? Is it really worth visiting Denham/Shark Bay? Can you drive through the Carnarvon-Mullewa Rd (Gascoyne River) in a 2WD? Is it worth seeing the wave rock or just getting to Esperance? ,Claire,Western Australia,
Sharing a bad experience I've had so others don't go through the same. When I exited the international arrivals gate at SYD I bought a SIM card from a small kiosk right in front of the exit doors. They had Vodafone signage all over and I recognize that brand so trusted it. They set me up and initially everything was fine. Except once I turned the corner toward the train station I saw the Optus and Telstra booths which advertised for half the price. Okay my mistake in choosing the first thing I saw. The company turned out to be Crown Mobile btw.    Less than 24 hours later I stopped receiving any service. I thought I was just getting bad reception so gave it another few hours. Finally I submitted a support ticket. Took them two days to respond. Apparently I had mistakenly texted an international phone number which was not part of my plan. Instead of alerting me and blocking it they automatically tacked on a $10 international plan without telling me then stopped my service for nonpayment. Grr. Fine paid it.    Waited another day still did not have service. Checked my account balance to make sure it cleared. Yes it cleared but now there was another $10 charge again without any explanation. I gave up and went to an Optus store for a new SIM card.    So six days without service on my ten day trip plus all the hassle. And when I got home I got an email that my Crown Mobile service is on auto renew and cannot cancel that until I pay the remaining balance on the account!    Crown Mobile are crooks beware! ,grrltraveler,Sydney,california

We have this attraction on our list of things to do and would like your input regarding which of the tours have most variety of species to look at. There are two tours that we are interested in ‚ÄòAquarium by Sunrise‚Äô and ‚ÄòAquarium by Twilight‚Äô. The blurb says that during the twilight tour the predatory species come out and the brightly coloured reef fish shelter in the coral caves - does that mean we wouldn‚Äôt see many of the brightly coloured fish therefore might we be better doing the sunrise tour? I know this is pretty trivial but an opinion from anyone with experience of this attraction would be very welcome. Many thanks ,Aidens_Granny,,"Ashbourne, United..."

Good afternoon  I am 63 and planning a trip to Exmouth Coral Bay and Monkey Mia in October this year to visit the Ningaloo reef and surrounding area. I am arriving from the UK and have travelled widely in Oz before. I cannot dive but I am an experieinced snorkeler. I will be hiring a car. I would love to see a manta ray as I haven't seen one yet whilst snorkeling.  I am hoping for some advice on my current plans as I have 10 days to play with.  I realise the whale sharks will of gone by the time I arrive but I hope to be able to take a humpback tour and see the humpbacks via snokeling if the tour is still running. I also enjoy the odd walk and enjoy visiting different places.  Once at a place I will be looking to book up snorekling tours and other trips.  Wed 18th Oct - Fly from Perth to Learnmouth & stay three nights in Exmouth  Sat 21st Oct - Drive to Coral Bay 2hrs and 150km & stay 3 nights  Tues 24th Oct - Drive to Monkey Mia 6hrs 580km & stay 3 nights  Fri 27th Oct - Plane flight from Monkey Mia back to Perth  Does the above sound like the best areas to stay to see the west coast around the reef where I can book up tours or snorkel form the beach.  A further question as I am travelling alone will there be many people around that will be snorkelling off the beaches so that I can hopefully join them.. better to snorkel with someone than alone..  Thank you for any advice give  Dave ,Dave,Exmouth,Chandler‚Äôs Ford...

Hi.  It's been quite a while since there's been a post on here about this so I just wanted to check if anything has changed post Covid.  Can anyone let me know if there's plenty of taxi/Uber availability from Yorky's knob to Skyrail Smithfield Terminal and the same from the Skyrail Terminal back?  Also I've done quite a bit of research but it would be fantastic if someone with local knowledge can offer advice.  My ship is tendered from 08:00 and leaving at 17:00 so I'm thinking  Get a Taxi at about 09:30 and book the Skyrail for about 10:00  Spend some time in Karunda  Get the 14:00 train back to Freshwater and bus to the Skyrail terminal  Taxi back to the Port for Tender (should get back by 16:00).  I'd be grateful for some advice  Thanks ,Billysouthwales,Yorkeys Knob,Port Talbot

Hi everyone    We have planned our first time in Australia from Perth airport along the coast to Exmouth. However we want to go towards the southwest coast and loop through Margaret River afterwards. We hate driving back the same way.    I was looking at the highway 95 road that goes to the 40 road (and the wave rock). The other option was coming off highway 95 to the 49 road that goes through Kalgoorlie and Lake Ballard. Can anyone recommend one of the routes?

Is 6GB enough for these 2 ?  # 1 sim card for more browsing and social media. 6GB or 15GB here ?  # Driving loop includes: Anaheim to San Diego to Grand Canyon to Las Vegas to Yosemite to San Francisco & LA.

We are currently looking at companies that offer multi day carry a pack only guided walks. Ideally looking for walks that are on the easier end of the range or have the option on days that are harder to have an easier option as well! One of us is very fit but 1 is only of average fitness.    Thinking that a better option may be to base ourselves in accomodation that offers activities such as 1/2 day or full day walks. We would be keen for accomodation that also does meals. This way we would do walks - but not quite as much as we would for in a 3-4 day walk.    We are quite open to a few days in 2-3 places if this option exists. Eg. Bay of Fires area for a few days and then Cradle Mountain for a few days.    Price wise - we are open to Peppers Cradle Mountain prices but not to Safire prices (although it looks absolutely amazing).    Really keen for suggestions on areas to base ourselves accomodation suggestions and companies that offer guided walks (not multi day as we already have detail on these).    Thanks so much. ,5fromAustralia,Tasmania,Sydney

We are planning 3 nights on Magnetic Island late July. We enjoy hiking swimming snorkelling and nice cafes. Strenuous uphill walks are not the best but some climbing is possible. We would appreciate advice on best location to stay (without our own car) where we could get the bus when needed. Looking at around 180-200 per night (if that is even an option?) self contained would be nice although places nearby to restaurants would be OK too.

I‚Äôm in Port Moresby now and saw a gorgeous little artwork. It seems to be made of sand painted onto a plywood backing. I know there are issues with sand dirt mud that sort of thing.

Looking for an apartment stay for the last 3 nights of AO tennis. Requirements are washing machine pool & breakfast so narrowed down to Mantra Southbank or Mantra on Jolimont. May be walking home alone on the Sunday night/Monday morning after men's final so tips on that may help decide. Jolimont seems closer but the walk to Southbank safer/easier as I am unfamiliar with Jolimont location & directionally challenged! Thanks in advance. ,Vic,Melbourne,Australia
Worst service ever and I have booked thousands of cabs around the world! Cab driver #599332 refused to switch on his meter and demanded $100 cash up front. Said it was surge pricing for Melbourne Cup. When we complained to 13CABS they rang the driver we could hear the phone ringing and he refused to pick up the phone. #599332 driver he told us he was his ‚Äúown boss‚Äù and answers to no-one! I became scared we were never going to make it home safely. He threatened to drop us off in an unfamiliar location unless we paid the surge price. I have messaged emailed and tweeted 13cabs for four days received no response. I would like some assurance from the operator that steps have been taken to ensure passengers are charged fairly and are safe. All over their facebook page I can see 13CABS advertising no surge pricing this is false advertising and therefore illegal. Will use a nice safe uber with a 5* rating next time at an agreed price. Don't get scammed like I did! ,Helen B,Melbourne,"Canberra, Australia"
I just rented a car from Enterprise at for our travels in Victoria. We are hoping to go to Beauchamp Hopetoun and Triplett Falls and continue west along the GOR. I know part of that is unsealed but is it gravel or just dirt?    The info included in the rental details says The renter or authorised driver must only use the rental vehicle on a road which is properly formed and constructed as a sealed metalled or gravel road. Then T&C says that there's a higher damage waiver for driving on unsealed roads that's listed in the rental details (which it's not) that you can't drive faster than 50km/hr on unsealed roads and that cars rented from remote locations can't drive on unsealed roads. ,mdod,Victoria,NC

Hi all    I'm just wondering about transiting from Domestic to International in Brisbane airport. I know the two terminals aren't connected.  We are flying from Cairns to Dublin through Brisbane and Dubai. Whole ticket is booked through Emirates and first leg from Cairns to Brisbane is codeshare flying Qantas.  We can't check in online because it's with two different airlines and includes international. Qantas told me I will check in at the Qantas desk in Cairns and get all 3 boarding cards and our luggage be checked through to Dublin. Emirates have told me we will only be checked in for Cairns to Brisbane and then have to collect our luggage in Brisbane and then check in with Emirates and drop our bags with them in Brisbane.  Does anyone know which will be the case? Just so I'm prepared. ,Ali_N,Brisbane,"Dublin, Ireland"
We will be doing a DIY road trip in Australia after circumnavigating the continent by ship. Our time on land is from 25 January to 24 March ... so approximately two months.    We have just begun to plan the road portion of our trip and my biggest question as we do so is can we do all or part of this trip without making advance reservations for accommodations so that we have some wiggle room to change our itinerary as necessary to speed up or slow down along the way?    Any thoughts and recommendations will be greatly appreciated.    (We will be spending a week in Sydney before the cruise and don't anticipate needing any long-term accommodations there once we begin our road trip.) ,eenusa,,Colorado
Hi all    Apologies if i'm duplicating as I've also posted this on the Australia forum.  I'm planning a trip to GBR for a few days in December a quick google search recommended flying from Sydney-Hamilton although I've seen reviews on here suggesting this is not the best idea and Cairns would be the better option?    A little overwhelmed due to the size of the GBR and I don't know where to start!    Any recommendations on hotels/villas etc to stay in?    Where is the best area for snorkelling/ diving?    Is everything organised via tours and guides any recs for these?    We are both confident swimmers have no dive experience but happy to take a course beforehand.    Any suggestions welcome!    Thanks ,Saskia,Great Barrier Reef,

I know people regularly ask about entry/transit times at Sydney. So I just thought I'd point out that at the moment it's chaos. Half an hour plus queues for the ticket machines before you even get to the entry gates. Queues the length of the baggage hall for quarantine without any queue management - never seen anything quite like it in any airport. Staff snowed under.    Chatted to a few staff there apparently not a one off. It was apparently even worse earlier in the week. Saw a number of people miss their domestic connections.    Took me two hours from gate to exit which is a new record for me and I know the machines with the short queues. Others would have taken longer.    Hope they at least get some queuing methodology implemented soon. ,inas,,Sydney
Hello fellow TAs    I have seen some itineraries floating around here and thought I would share mine as food for thought esp for fellow TAs who have kids travelling as well.    Caveat:  1) We are family of 2A2C 10 and 13yo. Our philosophy for travelling is to do things that are not commonly or totally unavailable in our country. We are not hiking people and ok to do simple walks. I have tried to keep the itinerary loose so that if we change our minds we can do so easily without losing too much from the itinerary. I have also listed alternatives found during my research where available.    2) We are travelling in November when sundown is at 8pm so we get plenty of extra daylight to drive until later in the evening. If you are travelling in winter you have to bear in mind sundown is around 4+pm and shops tend to close earlier as well.    3) While I strive to keep the itinerary as kids-friendly as possible mummy aka me has decided to throw in a few activities for my own benefit. I slogged hard to get the itinerary going so I should be rewarded right :)    Now down to business...    Wednesday:  - Touch down in late afternoon  - Head into Hobart City to check-in hotel.  - Walkabout.    Thursday:  - Drive out to Huon Valley to explore apple farms and honey bees  - Platypus Walk @ Geeveston  - Glen Huon Dairy Farm?  - Sorell Farm Visit - picking strawberries  - Quick hop to Richmond  - Drive down to Strickland Falls Silver Falls  - Back to Hobart hotel    Friday:  - Day trip to Bruny Island  - The Neck Lookout  - Adventure Bay beach to try and catch white wallabies  - Bruny Island Chocolate Co  - Cape Bruny Lighthouse - Lighthouse Tour  - Bruny Island Honey  - Aft getting off the island drive via Summerleas Road to Mount Wellington  - Sunset view @ Mount Wellington  - Back to Hobart Hotel    Saturday:  - Salamanca Market + Stock-up for cooking meals over next 2 days  - Drive up to Curringa Farm w stopover in Norfolk for late lunch  - Walkabout at Curringa Farm    Sunday:  - Farm tour  - Russell Falls + Horseshoe Falls  - Gordon Dam  - Return to Curringa    Monday:  - Breakfast on the farm + check-out  - Drive towards Cradle Mountain; stopover at Deloraine for late lunch + pick-up breakfast for next day  - Check-in to Cradle Mountain Wilderness Village  - Tour with McDermott's Cradle Mountain Night Spotting Tour; 2030-2200  **Can anyone please give feedback on the tour or something similar? We did one back many many years ago (when there were just two of us and dating) but it was booked together with our stay at Peppers. Quite fun. So wanted to do something similar again. Or do you suggest we should keep to night tours at Devils @ Cradle?**    Tuesday:  - Drive out to Tasmazia for the morning  - Late lunch at Christmas Hills + Ice cream @ Van Diemens  - Drive out to Mole Creek Karst cave tours. Will book the 1600 tour.  **PSA: the tours require booking 14 days out even though the tickets can only be bought on the day itself otherwise you risk not being able to get onto the tour.  - Drive to Dove Lake for short walks: Dove Lake Boatshed + Glacier Rock. Private vehicle access from 1800.  - Takeaway dinner from Tavern @ Peppers  - Back to CMWV.    Wednesday:  - Check-out from CMWV and take a shuttle trip down to the trails near Cradle Mountain Interpretation Centre: Enchanted Walk / Rainforest Walk  - If the kids are not keen alternative is to drive out to 41¬∞ South Tasmania  - Onward to Launceston Airport for 1655 flight to Melbourne    **Friendly reminder that you will need the National Parks Pass to enter Cradle Mountain and many other Park areas. Check out the Parks pass website here for information: https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/know-before-you-go/entry-fees.    I have suggestions for places to eat here and there as well as other activities/places I think might be interesting for our family but didn't make it on the list. PM if you are interested.    I have posted the second half of my trip itinerary for Melbourne at the Melbourne page: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g255100-i278-k14469932-Sharing_itinerary_for_this_coming_November_2023-Melbourne_Victoria.html.    Feel free to check it out.    At the end of the day I wish everyone will have a blast in their own version of itinerary.    Cheers! ,fireball1611,Tasmania,Singapore

We will be doing a day on Rottnest Island (taking a ferry from Fremantle is my plan) and I wanted to book the Oliver Hill train & tunnel tour and the Bayseeker bus tour separately even though I know there are some tours called the grand island tour that incorporate both of these in one package. The reason for this is because that combo package includes lunch and the lunch sounds less than stellar. If I book these 2 tours separately I'm trying to figure out if it's feasible to grab lunch at Frankie's on Rotto in between the 2 excursions I'll have about an hour and 45 minutes to work with as far as I can tell.    My other question is although I have seen nothing to indicate this on any of the booking sites Rottnest Island's website states that the Captain Hussey historical train is currently out of service. Apparently replacement buses are available so I guess the tour still happens it's just that you'll ride a bus instead. Anyone know when the train may be back up and running? ,Pugmama-san,Rottnest Island,"Beijing, China"
Hoping or some insight on timelines and distances at Sydney airport...We'll arrive on a DL flight at 650AM collect our luggage go through customs and then head to Emirates to check in for a 845AM flight to Christchurch.

Hey fellow travel enthusiasts!    I'm super excited to plan a trip from Melbourne to the Sapphire Coast this November (10/11-26/11) with my husband and our small dog. It will be our first holiday since relocating to Melbourne from Germany in February this year.    We've been researching and narrowed down our options to Huskisson Narooma and Merimbula but we're looking to keep it simple with just two stops. Depending on which two places we choose we will definitely have an overnight stop on the way to the Sapphire Coast and also on the way back to Melbourne (maybe Wangaratta or Lake Entrance).    We are beach/outdoor lovers and love good food. Can anyone offer some advice on which places to choose? Even if you have completely different suggestions we are open to them.    Thanks :) ,Charleen E,,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi My two sons in their early 20s are planning to get Scuba certified by pro Diving school (I believe). As part of the certification they are doing 9 dives (2 days liveaboard) .  They are good swimmers and have some experience in open water swimming but no real diving experience (except once in the pool - free scuba trial run - as part of a program).  The boat will also have some snorkelers.  Wanted to get feedback if it is a good idea or should we NOT do it?  Thanks. ,SVAA0814,Cairns Region,"Tampa, Florida"

We are travelling in February starting with 4 nights in Hobart.  I have quite a physical disability and walking any distance is pretty impossible.  Are there any places that it is absolutely not worth going to if you can't make the distance to actually see it? Never having been before we really don't know what to expect. I don't want to go to a place we thought we could see and find it's over a kilometer from the parking area and we can't get there. I can probably manage a kilometer at a pinch. It's happened before and it's so disappointing when all you can see is the sign in the car park.  Conversely are there some places that have extra easy access to enjoy the scenery etc?  I hope you can help with some advice. Cheers May ,May1958,Tasmania,"Perth, Australia"
Hello fellow TAs    Am posting this question here bcos I have learnt my lesson from our previous LA trip that diff rental companies have diff way of measuring their car boot size and I nearly couldnt fit all our luggages and purchases after a 10day trip.      We are 4pax coming to Tasmania/Melbourne in mid-end Nov with 2 large luggages 2 medium luggages. We intend to book a SUV. I am just not confident which SUV type would fit us better bcos car makes differ as well country to country. Take Hertz as an example should I be considering an Xtrail equivalent or Subaru equivalent? Or should I just get a 7seater Toyota Kluger equivalent?    Appreciate any tips. If this is not the right place to ask please bear w me and point me to the right link if u can.    Thank you!! üíê ,fireball1611,Melbourne,Singapore

We are checked into the unique Yarra Valley Tram Stay at the Oaks: https://theoakslilydaleaccommodation.com.au/accommodation/yarra-valley-tram-stay/.  - Dinner and supermarket stock-up at the nearby Lilydale town just down the road.    Thursday:  - Breakfast in the room  - Fruit picking. Depending on what is available we are looking at Cherryhill Orchards or Blue Hills Berries & Cherries. Note that we are chasing after cherries but if you are not interested you can consider Rayners Orchard. They have other fruits available - check the timetable on their website.  - Lunch @ De Bortoli. Read they have nice grounds hence making that trip up. Squeeze a swing by to Yarra Valley Dairy on the way if time allows.  - Yarra Valley Chocolaterie & Ice Creamery. Who can say no to chocolate and ice-cream right!? They have classes going on at different times so if you are interested check-out their calendar often to see they have any during your dates.  - Return to Lilydale early for bedtime. Our day starts early tmr!    Friday  - Quick snack in the room.  - Drive up to Balgrownie Estate for our Hot air Balloon Tour with Global Ballooning!  - Champagne breakfast at Balgrownie after touchdown  - Maybe we will return to Lilydale to sleep abit??  - Late lunch @ Healesville + grabbing snack takeaway from Beechworth Bakery  - Quick trip to the Big Bouquet Gerbera and Alpaca Farm  - Hop over to Chandon to pick up some sparklings if in time  - Return to Lilydale    Saturday  - Check-out from Lilydale early. Takeaway from one of the top few cafes in Lilydale - I count at least 3 popular ones.  - Puffing Billy 1000-1205. Check-in to the train latest at 0930.  - Drive down to Acland St for late lunch. Visit Luna Park if we have time. Stock-up at Woolsworth here or down at Rosebud/Mornington Peninsula  - Check-in @ AirBNB at Rosebud/Mornington Peninsula    Sunday  - Breakfast @ AirBNB  - Moonlit Sanctuary. They have quite a list of animal encounters at extra charge but should be quite fun for kids.  - Drive up to Philip Island.  - Depending on what time we arrive at Philip Island we can do choice of Philip Island Go Karts check-out Forrest Caves rockpools see seals at Nobbies  - Dinner  - Penguin parade starts late in November at 8.15pm. We are supposed to be seated an hour earlier.  - Back to AirBNB after.    Monday  - Check-out AirBNB  - Enchanted Adventure in the morning  - Take Searoad Ferries from Sorrento to Queenscliff  - Drive up to Geelong to visit Vintage Market Giant Sky Wheel and Carousel  - Drive to Melbourne Airport to drop off rental and take a cab ride out to Melbourne CBD.  - Check into hotel  **I have decided to drop off the rental back at airport because we will be relying on trams/buses/our feet for the two days we are there. No point paying for rental and carpark. Plus airport is not only a 30mins ride away so the cost justifies even for return trip Airport-CBD-Airport.**    Tuesday  - QVM in the morning  - GoBoat 2hrs experience - this is a cool drive yourself e-boat experience down Yarra River. We are going to do picnic lunch onboard  - Walkabout Melbourne CBD: Degraves Block Arcade Bourke St Mall Colins St  - Eureka Tower / Melbourne Skydeck at night    Wednesday:  - Monopoly Melbourne if it is opened already (our family is suckers for Monopoly :P)  - If not continue our Melbourne CBD walkabout from yesterday  - Lunch @ Chinatown  - Any last min buys  - Taxi back to airport by 1530.  - Our flight home at 1925.

We a couple in our 70s are planning on visiting Victoria and South Australia in Oct/Nov 2024. We have been to Australia three times before for a total of 11 weeks. We LOVE Australia! I really do not prefer one night stays for a variety of reasons. Is there a way to see the GOR with this in mind? I thought of going the inland way to some spot and do day trips? We are not so interested in the surfing end of the GOR ( we live in Southern California near the beach) but are interested in the Otway area as well as the major sites on the GOR itself. Then going back to Melbourne we‚Äôd like to stay in Hall‚Äôs Gap and Ballerat. At this point we do not have a time limit. We like exploring interesting towns mild hiking and walks scenic views animal sightings and Aboriginal culture and history. Is there an itinerary that can avoid one night stays and still be good use of our time or should I just suck it up and do the one nighters? Thanks so much for any help you can give me!

My wife and I fly into Ayers Rock airport on Sept. 5 arriving at 1:30 p.m. Our departing flight is on Sept. 8 at 4:15 p.m. From what I have read on this forum it will not likely take long to pick up a rental car at the airport. When booking should I book it for 1:30 or 2:00? I assume that really will not make any difference for the actual pick-up but it may for the return.    Our departing flight leaves at 4:15 p.m. From prior posts on this forum I have the impression that the vehicle return at the airport is likely to be a park-and-key-drop. How much time before the 4:15 flight do I need to allow for car return and whatever pre-boarding processes we will encounter?    Thank you. ,Rick S,Northern Territory,Saint Paul...

First time travellers to Aus in October. After 5 nights in Melbourne for the marathon I'm researching the best things to do for the second part of our trip. Do we fly to Brisbane and do some of the SC/GC and head down to Sydney or head over to Tasmania or head west? We are flying home from Mel. We are 4 adults looking for local culture and food national parks wildlife beautiful beaches and places of interest. A wine tour would be good. Not too touristy. Happy to try something different.

Hi everyone    We will be visiting WA in November and are looking to spend time in some of the national parks.    Mount Augustus looks amazing but there doesn't look like there is any accommodation nearby the same goes for Karijini. This might sound like a silly question but where does anyone stay when they visit them? Or do people go on a tour instead?    Also out of the 4 parks where should we spend more time?    Thanks ,Claire,Western Australia,
Hello i am currently pregnant and will be nearly 6months by the time i‚Äôm travelling to Cairns with my husband. We are considering to go on a day tour to Fitzroy Island. Is it safe for me as a pregnant woman to be on the ferry/boat to the island as i am aware that this will include 45-50min boat trip. Please let me know! Thank you! ,Caroline,Cairns,"Sydney, Australia"
Arriving in Sydney 11/1. 4 days there visiting new grand nephew. Leaving to NZ on 11/19 from Melbourne. We are driving. Want to see beautiful country but not all from windshield. Lol. Gold Coast then over towards Adelaide via coast rode? Maybe up to Flinders Ranges for taste of Outback country? Then head towards Melbourne? Just throwing some things out but would really like itineraries from local knowledge or some that have taken similar time and beginning and end point. Thanks in advance. ,Tim W,,Roseville...
I'm a solo traveler going to Australia for the first time in November. Flying into Sydney. Right now I'm thinking my itinerary will be Sydney Tasmania Uluru Melbourne and Cairns. I figure 3 days for both Uluru and Cairns/Great Barrier Reef. Longer in other places. Is mid November still tolerable in Uluru and Cairns as it gets closer to the heat at Uluru and the wet and stinger season at GBR? Any thoughts from people who've been would be welcome. ,M G,,San Francisco...
As first-time tourists to Sydney Melbourne and Tasmania what do we need to know about paying for public transport food and groceries? Do all stores accept cash or is there a way for tourists to deposit their cash in some e-wallet or card for all kinds of transactions? The reason I ask this is because I have bought AUD banknotes and will try to avoid using credit cards from my home country as the bank fee and exchange rate is rather high.    Also where can we check for taxi fares for Sydney and Melbourne areas? What is the most reputable taxi company there? ,StElle,,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Hi all    Myself & my wife-to-be decided on a rather spontaneous wedding early September and found no better place for a honeymoon than Australia which was our dream destination for a while already. I was hoping for your thoughts on a draft itinerary for 17 days below considering the weather as well as other valuable local experience.    We are flying from Singapore and it makes most financial sense (tickets are the cheapest) to fly into Sydney and leave from Melbourne but alternatives are manageable.    We are mainly looking for: 1) seeing and experiencing Australian wildlife (mostly roos koalas and penguins if possible); 2) experiencing some 'chill Australian vibe' and culture in general; 3) at least a few resort-like days on white beaches; 4) visiting Sydney as I was about to move there right before Covid hit; 5) beautiful sceneries and good seafood.    Given rather short timeframe we have decided to 1) leave off Uluru and the Outbacks as it does seem to take substantial time to cover we are also packing light with no hiking stuff in mind ; 2) leave off Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef as we've had/seen enough marine life in Galapagos a few months ago.    Sep 4-6: Sydney (2.5 days)  Sep 7: Blue Mountains  Sep 8: Fly or drive to Byron Bay (based on my research Sept is a good time for Byron Bay and it kinda fits the stereotypical 'Australian vibe')  Sep 9-10: Byron Bay  Sep 11: Get to Brisbane and flight to Whitsunday Islands (agains it seems that Sep is a good time to enjoy a few days there in a resort on iconic beaches it is a honeymoon after all).  Sep 12-13: Whitsunday Islands  Sep 14: Flight to Melbourne evening there  Sep 15-16: Great Ocean Road overnight in Lorne (?)  Sep 17: Flight to Kangaroo Island for the wildlife  Sep 18-19: Kangaroo Island  Sep 20: Flight to Melbourne evening there  Sep 21: Flight to Singapore    Would you have any recommendations on the itinerary above having in mind preferences listed and the time of the year? Should we cross anything out and reallocate those days to enjoy other places in full?    Bonus question: I am considering multi-city flights on either Singapore Airlines and Scoot. The difference p.p. is AUD 400. As I've never flown on Scoot is it worth paying more for Singapore Airlines given that both are 7-8 hour flights?    Appreciate your input very much! ,Karolis_LTU,,"Vilnius, Lithuania"
My wife and I a retired couple from Saint Paul Minnesota USA are planning a trip of about 2 weeks to Australia connected to a shorter visit to New Zealand for a family wedding on September 23. I posted a week or so ago asking how the school holidays in both countries could affect travel. Based on responses to those posts we have readjusted our schedule and will be traveling mostly before the wedding.    We realize two weeks is not enough time to see much of Australia (we did a seven week road trip in New Zealand a few years ago) but it‚Äôs the best we can do this trip. With our limited time we have decided to focus on three of Australia‚Äôs greatest hits: Sydney Uluru and the Great Barrier Reef. As we will not have time to drive to each of those areas I have been looking at flight scenarios. I just discovered yesterday that the very reasonable prices I was seeing on Quantas are largely due to a sale on international flights that expires in two days. That has forced us to make decisions about the itinerary more quickly than we would like. We have developed a tentative itinerary that works on Quantas that we think gives us an appropriate amount of time at each location. We most enjoy scenic and natural settings so hope to do some hiking though limited to day hikes and possibly kayaking. We also want to visit some historic and cultural settings.    Here‚Äôs our tentative itinerary:  Day 1 (Aug. 31): Arrive Sydney early a.m.  Days 2-5: Sydney and surrounding area with possible day trip to Blue Mountains. Is a day trip there worthwhile or is more time necessary? Can a day trip be done by train or will we need to rent a car?  Day 6: Fly to Uluru (Ayers Rock Airport) arriving early afternoon. This flight would be on Jetstar as Quantas has no flights on Tuesdays. I read some comment about Jetstar being problematic about luggage allowance but Quantas seems to say we would have a 50 pound limit which is all we would need. Is there something I am missing? It seems that we can‚Äôt fly both in and out of Uluru on Quantas without adding an extra day there which we are reluctant to do unless there‚Äôs a strong reason to avoid Jetstar. All of our other flights would be Quantas.  Days 7-8: Uluru and Kata Tjuta. I‚Äôve read competing opinions here about whether a car is necessary. For the moment we are planning on renting a car.  Day 9: Fly to Cairns arriving late afternoon.  Days 10-12: Great Barrier Reef location. We have not yet decided where we will make our base for exploring the reef but likely we will prefer a location smaller than Cairns like Port Douglas or one of the smaller villages south of Cairns. We will rent a car at Cairns. Any suggestions for a good location from which to catch tours of the outer reef (snorkeling only) and possibly do some kayaking.  Day 13: Fly to Auckland. We initially thought we would fly just Cairns to Sydney on this day and fly to Auckland from Sydney the next day. We are leaning now towards completing the journey to Auckland in one day with a flight from Cairns to Brisbane and then Brisbane to Auckland. It will get us to Auckland late 11:20 p.m. but that will only be 9:20 to us and we don‚Äôt mind getting to a hotel late. It seems sensible to have just the one long day of travel instead of using two days. Do you see any problems with that plan that we are overlooking?    I realize this is a very long and in some respects vague post but I would appreciate any thoughts on this itinerary especially if there are traps or problems we are missing. We ordinarily would have completed more research and had more details pinned down before booking flights but we know the basic locations we want to visit with our limited time and we would hate to pass up the sale prices available now on Quantas. Thank you. ,Rick S,,Saint Paul...
Due to boring reasons we are coming to NZ Feb and then into March for Australia. I realize April is better weather (one of my friends is an advisor on this forum) but I have to be home by March 17 the latest for a bridge competition.    I'm struggling with the itinerary. My main questions are:  A: Should I stay in the Blue Mountains for 2 nights? I found the most charming B &B but perhaps those are 2 days that can be subtracted)  B: Should I stay in Morington Peninsula before leading to the GOR trip?  C: Can I cut Apollo Bay to only one night?  D: How many days in Sydney and Melbourne?    Here's a general idea of the itinerary.

My wife and I will be visiting Australia for about two weeks in September ahead of a family wedding in New Zealand. I received great advice from the general Australia forum on our overall itinerary. We will be flying to Cairns from Uluru on September 8 arriving 7:15 p.m. We fly to Auckland on September 12 leaving Cairns at 1:35 p.m. That gives us three full days in the area.    Currently I‚Äôm inclined to stay in Palm Cove. We‚Äôve found an accommodation that looks great and there is a kayak trip out of Palm Cove that we‚Äôd like to do.    But our main objective in the area is to do a full day snorkeling reef tour. I‚Äôve booked a tour with Seastar out of Cairns on September 9. However they are fully booked for September 10 and 11 so if the tour on the 9th were cancelled we could not reschedule for a later day. To give us that option I‚Äôm thinking about booking a tour for September 10 with another company. I like the look of the similarly smaller tour from Wavelength but that runs out of Port Douglas. Is it crazy to think we could drive from Palm Cove to Port Douglas for a tour departing around 8:00 a.m.? We don‚Äôt mind getting up early but would we need to build in a lot of extra time as a contingency for traffic delays or other problems that early in the morning? If we should stick with a tour from Cairns as our backup option what do you think about Ocean Freedom? They take twice as many passengers as Seastar but at least it doesn‚Äôt appear to be pontoon-based snorkeling and it's smaller than the 90-passenger Silverswift tour. I suppose the initial question should have been whether I‚Äôm being excessively concerned about a cancellation of our booked September 9 tour?    Thanks for your thoughts. ,Rick S,Cairns Region,Saint Paul...

Can anybody suggest ideas for travel from Sydney (CBD) to Newcastle (Charlestown area) without having to rent/hire a car? We don't want to do the actual driving ourselves.  I know there's a train but we'll have luggage. How feasible is that idea? Specifics would be great.  Are there shuttle vans or similar? A door-to-door option like this would be our preference but what I've found so far costs $1300 which is too pricey.  What about a bus? Is that safe or is it similar to riding a long-haul bus in the US?  We're trying to plan for February 2024 and there are just two of us.    How do folks in Newcastle get to the airport if they aren't driving?

Hi there    on Sept. 02 we will be driving up from Warroora to Exmouth. We expect to arrive around lunch time / early afternoon. Our time in Exmouth is very limited though - the following day we will leave early to Karijini. Obviously we'd like to make the best of what little time we have. From my research I've identified two options: either do to combined kayak / snorkeling afternoon tour or a sunset whale watching tour.    Now for the whales I am a bit wary. Some sources say they usually won't arrive until the end of August so I see the risk of them arriving later than usual. Also I am not sure how close those boats may approach the whales. I've seen whales before in Australia Alaska California and South Africa so going on a cruise to observe tiny dots in the distance is not that attractive to us anymore.    Ideally we would not book any tour until maybe an hour before our arrival but is that even feasible? Or would we risk getting no seats at all because everything is booked out (we'll arrive on a Saturday)?    Looking for ward to your opinions.

Hi there    I‚Äôm taking my Mum to Sydney for 3 nights in early October and am looking for suitable accommodation. She‚Äôs in her 80‚Äôs and mobile but only very short distances. I plan to Uber around so will not be taking public transport. We would need 2 beds and I‚Äôd much prefer a large room ideally with breakfast included.  I‚Äôm open to any hotel suggestions please? Probably more suited to a smaller establishment with less walking involved. I am considering renting a wheelchair.    Our plans will be her catching up with a friend one day (Uber/taxi there) a ferry trip somewhere (fish/chips) and possibly a garden or shopping outlet stop.

Hello!    I am in the midst of planning for our trip to Sydney (gf and I) and have maybe gone overboard on tours?    I had planned on signing us up for a tour (1st day of a 5day trip) to learn some history and get a broad overview of the city- but I ended up going for two tours in the same day.    The first one is a 10:30 Sydney Opera House Walking Tour and then a Sydney The Rocks Guided Walking Tour at 1:30pm.    We are staying at the Hyatt Regency so I felt this was walkable from our hotel.    My thinking was this would also give us time to have breakfast before and a nice lunch in between tours but now I am doubting this logic and two tours may be too much for one day.    Im not really worried about the physical strain of walking but the redundancy of information.    Advice? Is one tour enough to learn about Sydney? ,Toni M,Sydney,"Austin, Texas"
Hi    My girlfriend and I have previously travelled Sydney to Brisbane before COVID cut it short and we had to fly home. 3.5 years on we have now booked to return to the East Coast and finish off the trip going from Brisbane to Cairns.    Stupidly I didn't realise and didn't think to check what the weather would be like in January (this is my own fault for not grasping the sheer size of this country)... However we have already booked flights from the UK to Melbourne then return from Cairns back to the UK.    This is our rough itinerary planning to hire a car and drive the route. We have so far booked accommodation up until Airlie Beach. Is it worth altering this itinerary some how to now avoid North QLD due to the rainy season or is it still worth it?    28/12: Arrive in Melbourne  29/12: Fly to Sydney spend 3 days here seeing family and spending NYE in the city.  01/01: Fly to Brisbane  02/01 - Noosa Heads  03/01 - Noosa Heads - Fraser Island tour  04/01 - Rockhampton - Nothing planned just to break up the long drive.  05/01 - Airlie Beach  06/01 - Airlie Beach - Whitsunday sailing tour  07/01 - Airlie Beach - Whitsunday sailing tour  08/01 - Airlie Beach  09/01 - Hamilton Island - Lounge on a beach  10/01- Hamilton Island - Lounge on a beach  11/01 - Townsville  12/01 - Townsville - Magnetic Island  13/01 - Mission Beach  14/01 - Cairns  15/01 - Port Douglas & Daintree  16/01 - Cairns - Fitzroy Island  17/01 - Cairns - Fly home    I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has done anything similar in the past particularly during rainy season and how it went?    Is it worth us stopping at Noosa Heads and instead focussing back towards the south?    Thanks! ,Ross S,,
Hi fellow travelers. I will have 3 nights/four days to spare while in Sydney this coming July. I have an itch to rent a car and do a self-drive road trip that starts and ends in Sydney and allows me to see some of the surrounding area. Does anyone (1) know where I can find some itineraries that would be good?; or (2) have a recommendation already? I'll be a solo traveler so no need for family activities etc. Just an introvert out exploring :)    Thanks in advance for your help!! ,M. Johnson,Sydney,"Berkeley, California"
Advice on itinerary please staying in Broad beach from 28 dec-4 Jan 24 before moving to Brisbane for a few nights. Just looking for suggestions on how to best fill our days as a family of 4 with a 10 and 16 year old in tow. Maybe a couple of theme parks definitely wet n wild shopping and a few chill out days. Conscious of the time of the year and what days would be best spent where. Thank you ,Aroha22,Gold Coast,
I will be arriving in Sydney on April 2 2024 and would like to spend a few days in either Ayer‚Äôs Rock or Cairns before leaving on April 12. The time/money I have available will not allow me to do both. The Skyrail and Kuranda Scenic Railway sound interesting but I would like opinions from others as to whether Ayer‚Äôs Rock might be more compelling.

We will be staying in Brisbane for a few nights before flying to LEI for 2 nights. We have rented a car to be picked/returned to the airport in Brisbane so that we may do some day trips. My plan is to get the car on arrival to Brisbane and then return it after the trip to LEI when we fly out of Brisbane to Sydney. I understand that there is parking at the Redcliffe airport and that it is unsecured but I'm wondering how safe it is to leave the rental car there for the 3d/2n we are at LEI? We would also likely be leaving some luggage in the trunk of the car do to the limits with flying to LEI but would not leave valuables and bags would be out of sight. Is this a terrible plan? ,YoyoSun,Brisbane Region,Texas
I am helping plan a gap year trip for my wife's thee nieces.    They will likely spend 4-5 months in Australia and will want to work for at least part probably much of that time. All are experienced in working in the hospitality industry having worked in bars and restaurants whilst at University.    I have put them on to WWOOFs as an option but they seem more keen to find work in bars  restaurants hotels or ski resorts (all are experienced skiers).    What would be the best way to seek work. Get there and find something? Go to an employment /temp agency on arrival? Make direct contact with potential employers in advance?    They understand the need to sort out working visa issues well in advance.    Any thoughts would be much appreciated. ,crellston,,"London, United..."

We will be starting our 3 week journey in Sydney and driving up the coast from there. Looking for advice on the second half of our journey. Originally planned to arrive in Gold Coast next month on the 2nd or 3rd of May and stay 2-3 nights. From there spend 2 nights in Brisbane then fly up to Whitsundays (flying into Airlie and then taking a ferry or flying right to Hamilton Island) spending 4 nights on Hamilton Island with a day trips to WhiteHaven beach and to snorkel and see the Reef from there. Finally from there planned to go onto Port Douglas before flying back to Sydney for our flight home.  I wanted to spent a couple of nights in the Glass Mountains area doing some shorter hikes. However then we'd fly out of Sunshine Coast versus Brisbane which is ok. But we are running out of time and don't want to be rushed so we have to adjust the itinerary somewhere.  Better to skip Glass Mountains and / or Port Douglas or even skip Brisbane other than maybe stopping for a day? What would we be missing if we skipped Port Douglas area?  I'll add we like to get off the beaten path and avoid tourist spots and/or party destinations. Just not an option to avoid that in this part of the country from what I am reading. We do want to explore the county and what it all has to offer meet locals and see the best your country has to offer. This is our first trip to Australia. Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. ,Huskers76,Queensland,Bloomington...

Unfortunately International travel still has some frustrating issues. I have a trip coming up landing in SYD @ 6:30 and have an 8+ hour layover. As of yet I have not been able to do anything about the layover. So I thinking about a brunch in the city. It will be a weekday so that may change some things.    I have been to Sydney a few times know the airport well (Domestic and International terminals) and where the train is to the city. However having no other idea I guess we may head to Circular Quay. But exactly where I am not sure. Otherwise I am open to any other ideas. Any suggestions? ,GAFoodie,Sydney,"Atlanta, GA"
My wife and I will be visiting New Zealand for a September 23 family wedding. We did a seven week road trip around New Zealand just a few years ago so we don‚Äôt plan to spend a great deal of time there this trip. We have been thinking we would fly over to Australia several days after the wedding for about two weeks. We know that‚Äôs too short a time for such a large country but it‚Äôs all we can allow this time around.  Because we thought end of September-early October would be a shoulder season for tourism we have not booked anything for Australia yet. The other day I learned about the two-week school holiday that immediately follows the wedding date. I'm wondering what impediments that may create for our travel. Because we have only two weeks we would probably do just the big three of Sydney Uluru and the Great Barrier Reef. Will all of those areas already be booked? Will they be crowded with families with kids at that time?  Thanks for your thoughts. ,Rick S,,Saint Paul...
Hi all    My husband and I are looking at options for watching the New Year's Eve fireworks. He has his heart set on a boat cruise. We've been looking at two one is the James Craig tall ship and the other is the Captain Cook Sydney 2000. I've found a couple of mentions on here but not much to help us decide which is best can anyone help? Obviously the view is our main priority we want a great view of the fireworks but also a lovely evening all round. I was worried about there being a bunfight of loads of people trying to see through the windows on the Sydney 2000 but I've been told that's not the case and there is also an outside deck!    We know it's expensive but this is a bucket list trip for my husband who has stage 4 cancer so we are prepared to pay for something really special. ,Linda,Sydney,"Southampton, United..."

Hi fellow travellers  I will be in Melbourne during the last week of July for work and I need to be in Sydney by mid of the week after(for work again). This gives me the weekend plus two days to explore and get to Sydney from Melbourne.    Looking for suggestions for the itinerary for 4 days starting in Melbourne and ending in Sydney  - I love road trips. Prefer motorcycles over cars. Is a road trip from Melbourne to Sydney worth the time? Coastal vs Inland route? Also given it's winter is it advisable to do a motorcycle trip or to stick with car?  - Interested in: scenic roads and destinations good food offbeat experiences. Not a huge fan of skiing.  - Few things that caught my eye: the great ocean road penguin parade at philip island whale watching.  - Melbourne: This is my first visit to Melbourne. I will have the evenings during the week to explore Melbourne but can use the part of 4 days to explore more of Melbourne and around.  - Sydney: I have been to Sydney before and have explored the city and around. So not looking to spend any of the 4 days there.    Thanks in advance. ,Mohammed Haseeb,Melbourne,"Bengaluru, India"
Hi  WE are on a very tight holiday schedule due to work and I was wanting to maximise out time. I was looking for some advice from driving from Launceston to cradle mountain Our flight lands at 1.40pm into Launceston in early August and I was wondering if it was to much of a push to drive to cradle mountain that afternoon. By my calculations are once we get the rental car and drive to cradle mountain it would be about 5pm with the sunsetting at 5.30pm. We are from Queensland so we are not familiar with icy road conditions. I was wondering when the optimal time are to drive up to cradle mountain in winter and if we should be able to arrive safely or if we should leave it until the next day Thanks you for your tips and advice ,Danni I,Tasmania,

Hi making tentative travel plans. I've discovered there's a daily morning bus from Echuca to Swan Hill that would be perfect for what I want to do.  But since backup plans are always needed in the event of a bus no-show can train tickets (via Bendigo) be easily bought on the day? I'd be travelling very off-season and not in the school holidays and no car backup so at the mercy of public transport. ,Kay004,Echuca,New Zealand

Hi all I'm going to try and put up a few posts looking at areas of Victoria that are well worth a visit. Keep them in mind for future planning.    I recently took a day trip to Echuca.  This is a great spot to visit for a weekend or combined with Bendigo as part of a regional tour of our State. It's jam packed full of history.  There are a few stopping off points like Heathcote famous for the shiraz grown in the regions ancient red Cambrian soil and Rochester where the tourist information centre is also the Sports museum featuring the cyclist Hubert Opperman. Rochester has 4 pubs a number of cafes and several town trails including murals and the painted silo. Rochester is still recovering from floods in November 2022 so they'd love a bit of passing trade!    Get outtta town!  Where? Echuca Northern Victoria on the mighty Murray river.    How?  Drive from Melbourne via Kilmore Heathcote & Rochester about 2h 45m or V/Line coach/train bus - about 3 hours - bookings advised.    Eats?  Plenty of cafes pubs and restaurants. Branch of the Beechworth bakery in town and a great gin distillery.    Do?  Historic waterfront; Holden car museum; Riverboat cruises; Great Aussie Beer Shed and heritage farm museum; Murray River walks; Historic shopping precinct; Gardens; Heritage museum; art galleries; cinema; fishing; heaps of shopping.    Stay? Variety of choices from caravan parks motels and hotels B&Bs    More information?

Hi    We are from the UK andtravelling to Sydney Brisband and Byron for our wedding (sydney) and holiday/honeymoon afterwards in December/January with our 3 year old son.    Currently heading to Brisbane for a few nights and then Byron (where we have been many times and is a fave) booked up until 7th Jan but we don't fly out of Brisbane home to the UK until the 15th Jan.    We have been recommended to visit Noosa heads so are thinking of going there for a few nights but wondered if anyone has any other recommendations for places that are super kid friendly drivable (max 3 hours) from Brisbane?    Also... looking at all the many resorts around Noosa Heads have found RACV to have little water slides (we just need little ones for our 3 year old) so we just wondered if any of the other hotels in Noosa Heads have waterslides or anyone knows of any other places with hotels that have waterslides suitable for little kids?

Hi everyone  I have just arrived in Brissie with my 17 year old son. We're both exhausted from exams new job etc and happy to be here for 4 nights. However I desperately need walking sandals (my friend's dog just chewed through mine) - does anyone have an idea of what's the best place to find brands like Merrell and other comfortable long-distance walking sandals in Brisbane CBD?    Also is there anything of particular interest on this weekend? Nothing dramatic and I'm already aware there are markets on Sunday at Botanic Gardens. Otherwise I think we're happy to eat stroll and see a couple of galleries.    Thank you!  Katherine ,Katherine W,Brisbane,
We are two retirees who love to travel the world. We are from Indiana and will be taking a cruise from Sydney to New Zealand in December. We have very successfully used other companies like Go2Africa and Adventure Life for incredible adventures in Africa and Peru/Equador/Galapagos Islands after getting recommendations from these forums. We love planning our adventures but it is so wonderful to have locals to help recommend and coordinate everything so we can really enjoy our time and learn more about the local people and culture. My husband and I have never been to Australia/NZ and this is a bucket list item. Our ship leaves Dec 9 from Sydney and we would like to spend the week prior seeing some highlights of incredible Australia. A few must haves: a few days in the Great Barrier Reef (I am an avid snorkeling lover; we would love to be on a ship and snorkel on and off at various places like we did in the Galapagos) seeing Koalas Wallabies and other native species. We love the outdoors and all our beautiful world has to offer. Our travels have focused on nature (the Galapagos and Africa) along with wineries cultural tours/sites/local foods including any Catholic Religious sites/monasteries. Our budget for travel/accommodations are about $5000 (but flexible) for 7-8 nights prior to cruise in Australia. We are budget-minded but also prioritize our travels in our retirement. We so appreciate all of you and the great advice we have received. ,FreckledFromIndiana,,"Avon, Indiana"
Hi I'm trying to decide between two GBR day trips for snorkelling. I'd like to book one that allows me to see as much sea life as possible (obviously weather dependent) and fewer crowds is a bonus.    The two I'm trying to decide between are the Frankland islands Reef Tour and the Seastar trip to Michaelmas Cay and Hastings Reef. Has anyone done either of these and can share feedback? I can't do both as I don't have the time. ,jug_child,Cairns Region,"Darwin, Australia"
Hello    I am planing a visit to Sydney in the first week of August with my two teenage daughters(1613) for four nights. It was supposed to be a family trip for four but my wife can‚Äôt go because of her work schedule.    I was originally planning for two connecting rooms in Shangri-La hotel but one bigger room looks more attractive at the moment.    Pullman Quay Grand Sydney Harbour  Four Seasons Hotel  Meriton Suites Sussex Street    These three are hotels I am looked for more closely.  Meriton Suites seems to provide the largest room with the least cost and the location is better with other two hotels.    Four Seasons seems to be a safer choice in terms of service and the view.    For Pullman Quay I was hoping may be we could take a short walk around the Opera house more often during out stay.    Prices for 4 nights are all in $3000-3500 range.    Could you give any advice among these hotels or maybe other options for me?    Thanks you in advance. ,puha,Sydney,"Seoul, South Korea"

We are 3 pax arriving to Hamilton Island next week at around 12.30pm. We are hoping to spend the afternoon looking around and then catch the ferry to Airlie Beach at approximately 5pm.

My friend will be flying into T3 next month (solo) and with the new airport line train open I thought to suggest he try it out but realised it doesn't directly serve T3/T4. The following information is on the Perth Airport web site:    << Redcliffe Train Station on the Airport Line is only 15 minutes from Perth Underground Station in the CBD [...] . Passengers should exit the train and catch Bus Route 292 to reach Terminals 3 and 4. Bus Route 292 is a circular service between Redcliffe Station and the terminals' pick-up and drop-off area with services every 12 minutes during peak times. >>    Has anyone tried this? Any thoughts on how easy it is to find and use this bus? I am assuming as the Redcliffe station is new that it will be fairly easy to get around?    My friend is generally averse to bus rides except maybe the door-to-door private shuttles (which I generally avoid in Australia outside of Skybus).    Thanks! ,Jeremy512,Perth,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi!    I am currently planning my itinerary for a 4-month trip around Australia.    Top of the bucket list is WA ( specifically Ningaloo Reef and surrounds). We are based and starting the trip from the Gold Coast. Looking for advice on which way to go as we cannot leave until mid-September and only have 4 months.    Ideally we would go north straight away heading to Cairns and then making our way across to Broome and down from there to hopefully avoid the wet/hot/stinger season. Is leaving mid-September too late to go North? Our other option is to go South but by the time we get around to Exmouth it would be around Christmas time!    Have been doing lots of research but we are from overseas so would appreciate any advice from people more knowledgeable!    Thank you :) ,Emily W,,Noosaville...

6 day trip now interested in getting a 4wd and camping. But the 4wd options we‚Äôve seen that are ACTUALLY bookable in Darwin (directly from Britz Apollo etc) don‚Äôt have pop up or rooftop tents. (Vroomvroomvroom Australia cheerfully quotes setups from Britz and Apollo that do - but that makes no sense).      We are very familiar with both rooftop and ground tents and far prefer the former for various reasons (Ease of setup not dirty if it rains snows (ha ha not in the Top End!) or is muddy.

My wife will be 1 year-old and me will be traveling to Australia for 12 days from Nov 22 to Dec 6 flying into and out of Sydney. I could use some input in our travel itinerary as there is so much to do and see in Australia and we want to make the most sense with our travel plans. We are excited to travel to Australia it‚Äôll be the first international trip with our baby. We took him to Maui for a week before and he did so well. We are wanting mostly to experience the beautiful landscapes and wildlife of Australia more so than city experiences. We are thinking Sydney Melbourne and surrounding areas and the Great Barrier Reef. I‚Äôve read November is the start of the stinger season and wet season where the GBR is so we are hesitant. So far this is our itinerary:  - Nov 24-26: Sydney  - Nov 27: Blue Mountains day trip  - Nov 28: fly to Melbourne. Day in Melbourne.  - Nov 29: Rent car and drive the Great Ocean Road. Spend night in Apollo Bay.  - Nov 30: Great Otway possibly Grampians.  - Dec 1: Drive to Dandenongs. Ride Puffing Billy. Possibly Healesville Sanctuary.  - Dec 2: Maybe visit Yarra winery Moonlit Wildlife Sanctuary vs Maru Koala Park.  - Dec 3: Nobbies to see the seals Philip Island for the penguin March at night.  - Dec 4: Fly back to Sydney  - Dec 5: relaxing day exploring or at the beach.  - Dec 6: fly home    Is this too much for a 1 year old? Should we try and spend less time anywhere and add trip to Port Douglas to visit the Great Barrier Reef? At this time will it be too hot to visit up north and should we then consider access to southern part of Great Barrier Reef via Lady Musgrove Island? Tips and recommendations would be much appreciated. We know time is limited and plan to return to Australia in the future. ,David S,,"Salt Lake City, Utah"
Hi    We are headed to Australia and New Zealand in March 2024 for 2 weeks. That said there is so much to choose from that we are a bit overwhelmed and wanted to ask people what they might recommend as 'can't miss this' type places.    Here is what we are working with:    - 2 weeks with 2 days for travel from Canada.  - So far we know we want to visit Sydney.  - Our 'leaning' is to focus on the East side of AU to avoid too much travel between places.  - Melbourne is a maybe. Is Sydney enough for an AU city?  - Recommendation on time split between NZ and AU.  - Recommendation on whether to start or finish with NZ.  - We are active ages 5055 and 70 in good shape.  - Hoping to see a mix of urban and also rural for any interesting must-see spots.  - We don't dive but we snorkle ( as long as sharks aren't a concern ).  - Mid range budget not budget but not baller either.    Huge thanks in advance if people can assist with ideas or suggestions and ty! ,P&K,,"Toronto, Canada"
Hello Everyone!    We are headed to your lovely city towards the end of July and staying near the Circular Quay. We'll be in Sydney for 4 days then Melbourne for 3 and back to Sydney for a last full day before flying back to the US via Hawaii. We were thinking about trying the Coogee > Bondi beach walk around lunch one day and then read on the forum that a ferry to Watson's Bay from there might be nice and then another ferry from Watson's Bay back to Circular Quay.    Wondering how long each of those legs might take. If the weather isn't clear should we nix the walk and just ferry out to Watson's or Manly? and ferry back again? But then if weather isn't clear guessing we should also skip the ferries for that day? What are your thoughts?    Tasty food is a high priority for us on our vacations where and when possible. If we end up doing the beach walk and ferry or two as mentioned above where might be some great suggestions on places to have lunch? I know food is very subjective and people will likely have differing opinions. Tasty food to us doesn't have to be fine dining (though it certainly can be if it's worth it). We are equally happy with very casual places.    We would also like to visit the Taronga Zoo (more ferries!) around lunch time one day (again any thoughts on tasty lunches in that area?). I believe these advanced purchase tickets are not tied to a date so we can try to save for a day with the best weather.    Last idea was to go out to Scenic World on another day (again weather dependent). Wondering how long that whole trip out viewing there and returning might take. Is this something that can be done between lunch and dinner? Or should we plan a lunch at or around Scenic World?    I know we'll be missing the Cherry Blossom Festival by 3 weeks or so. Wondering how the blossoms are looking this year and whether it looks like they might be early or late. Just wondering if I might be able to catch a glimpse of any of them or if it's a lost cause and we'll miss the entire season completely.    Thank you all of your help and thoughts in advance! ,zeo219,Sydney,"New York City, New..."
Hello from California. :) My daughter and I will be traveling later this month and attending a program at the Opera House staying at the Marriott Circular Quay for 5 days. This part of the trip will include a Harbor Cruise and an animal sanctuary. We will then switch hotels and be on our own for a 3 night stay.    For Hotel 2 I'd like to get a moderately spacious 1 bedroom preferably with a small kitchenette but refrigerator and microwave would be sufficient. There is a great deal right now on Meriton Suites Sussex Street Sydney. My favorite is the SKYE Suites Green Square but it's about 25% more. Can anyone compare these two quality and location-wise?    I'd like to be very near a grocery store of some kind if we do have a kitchenette. I'd also like to hear about any great property I overlooked (I was using location near the Rocks as a guide).  We will go to the Aquarium but haven't firmed up plans other than that. She loves animals and probably will want to go shopping. I enjoy walking around while she is sleeping in late. I haven't yet had time to look into how to get around to see the tourist spots so please advise. Any must not miss ideas for teens?    Thanks so much! ,GeckoMom,Sydney,Santa Barbara...

Understand that Australia is a big producer/supplier of health supplements products like vitamins fish oil etc. And they have lots of reputable brands like Blackmores etc.    May I know where would be the best place to buy supplements in Melbourne/Sydney?

Hi there. The final days of our upcoming trip to Tasmania look like this:    0822 evening arrival at Bicheno (accommodation already booked)  0823 Freycinet NP // ???  0824 ??? // evening departure (1845) from Hobart to Melbourne    So I now wonder what to do on the 23rd and the 24th. The morning of the 23rd is reserved for the Wineglass Bay Hike but what about the rest of the day? Should we spend more time in the Park - and do what? Or should we head down to Port Arthur and spend the rest of the 23rd and part of the 24th there?    Another option would be the spend the night of the 23rd in Bicheno and then travel down to Port Arthur on the 24th for just a few hours. We will already have spent in Hobart so I guess arriving there two hours before the departure of our flight would be sufficient.    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Tasmania,"Cologne, Germany"

Hi there    the itinerary for our September Trip from Perth to Darwin looks like this:    Perth - Nambung NP - Kalbarri NP - Francois Peron NP (Beach Camping) - Exmouth - Karijini NP - 80 Mile Beach - Gibb River Road - Bungle Bungles NP - Darwin    Between Exmouth and Karijini we might travel on one of the Rio Tinto Railway Access Roads. Now I wonder: on which sections should we reduce the pressure of our tyres and to which level? We (2 adults) will be travelling in a Britz 4WD Landcruiser with a rooftop tent and probably 60 kg of luggage plus groceries and camping equipment.    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Western Australia,"Cologne, Germany"
Hi all  My husband and I are self driving (15 days ) in October this year off the Spirit of Tasmania.  We have previously spent time exploring Hobart and Port Arthur so won‚Äôt be venturing to that region of the state this trip.  The following is a very tentative itinerary that I‚Äôm most happy to receive criticism for as I appreciate it‚Äôs quite packed.  My plan is to predominantly stay in caravan parks in cabins to self cater with the occasional meal out - we have a fridge/freezer on board our 4WD - and B&B style accommodation. So recommendations for places would be greatly appreciated üòä    Day 1 Davenport to Stanley  Day 2 Stanley to Cradle Mountains  Day 3 Cradle Mountains  Day 4 Cradle Mountains to Strahan  Day 5 Strahan  Day 6 Strahan to Queenstown  Day 7 Queenstown to Derwent Bridge  Day 8 Derwent Bridge to Hamilton  Day 9 Hamilton to Swansea  Day 10 Swansea to Bay of Fires  Day 11 Bay of Fires to Waterhouse  Day 12 Waterhouse to Launceston  Day 13 Launceston to Flintstone  Day 14 Flintstone to Davenport  Day 15 Davenport    So I know it‚Äôs far from perfect but it covers the ground we‚Äôre keen to explore and we like to sightsee and are open to far more experienced opinions!

Hello everyone! I from Singapore and will be heading to brisbane in Nov for a work exchange programe for around 3 weeks. Will be bringing my family (spouse 12 and 13 year old). Have so much questions!    Firstly for lodging balancing convenience and affordability.. would service apartment / airbnb be more appropriate? any recommendations on which areas will be good? We would likely be cooking our meals hope to stay somewhere accessible markets or groceries.    Next transport. Is it possible to navigate around the brisbane without a rental car? with 4 pax traveling would public transport or renting a car be wiser?    Are there any suggestions for weekdays evenings (after work) for the family?    Of course touristy stuff! with weekdays evenings.... and 3 weekends.... would like to maximise the time for tourist stuffs. some thoughts I have gathered..  - moreton island for day trip or overnight?  - mount coot-tha. would like to see some waterfalls. is half a day enough?  - lone pine for koala  - heard of a river cruise at South Bank..  Would appreciate any itinerary suggestions.    Any other suggestion for the family to maximise the trip and any advise on cost saving would very greatly appreciated! ,jhky,Brisbane,"Singapore, Singapore"
I usually spend hours scrolling thru these wonderful forums piecing together my own itinerary for trips but this time I feel out of time so hoping to get some direct advice if possible. My hub and I going to be in Sydney for 3 full days end of July (SOON!). Have never been and understand it‚Äôs way too short but would love to enjoy as much as we can while there.    I plan to spend one of our full days in the Blue Mountains - taking public transport most likely. Though another post recently made me consider doing a full day tour with a stop at Featherdale (which I know has mixed reviews)- just to make things easier planning wise for us.    The other 2 days I would love guidance: staying at hilton downtown one night then sofitel darling harbour the other two. We are not fine diners- prefer tasty cheap eats or local finds. Ideas I have gathered from the forums that I think would be interesting for us: sydney opera house tour congee to bondi walk doing a ferry or two (which is best if limited time? watsons bay?) just spending time exploring iconic or famous areas of the city. Maybe the zoo? Any other must-sees for our short time there?    Any ideas on what itinerary/order would work best given our location? Not sure what is reasonable in terms of transportation between sites and length of time adequate to explore. Would love to just leave feeling like we got a feel of the city. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! ,kirpow,Sydney,Yorba Linda...
What is the most reliable & resonably priced shuttle to use from Brisbane International Airport to Noosa?    One our departure we will shuttle back from Noosa & need one night near the airport.

Is there anything fun to do around the area in the evening.... nice restaurant activities or would we need to go into Brisbane? ,Craig P,Brisbane,

So many questions!!    We‚Äôre heading to Brisbane for son‚Äôs waterpolo tournament in January (6 nights) then wanting to do 4 nights somewhere else.

I don‚Äôt know Brisbane at all so would love advice on where to stay. We will have other son 19 with us.    The team are staying Fortitude Valley. I don‚Äôt know whether to stay there or more centrally in the CBD?    Also would love ideas for where we can go as a family for a few nights at the end? Boys are 17 and 19.

Hi all    Looking at taking our kids on a family holiday (1.5 years old and 10 years old). We are from Rockhampton but i'm envisioning a holiday staying somewhere with lots of fun for the kids - plus day trips out to aquariums zoos parks and other fun stuff for kids. The kids never stop they want to be doing things and seeing things ALL day.    We are on a budget of course. Cairns looks interesting as we could drive out to Paronella Park which looks really interesting. Plus you can fly there cheaply with Bonza from Rockhampton.    I would LOVE any suggestions for great family friendly ideas around Cairns or maybe a suggestion for another place for visit for a Queensland holiday. We have never been on a holiday as a family of 4 so looking forward to it just not sure where to start with planning. ,Bergci,Queensland,Rockhampton...

Ok I think I have my itinerary just about down. But I would like to hear some opinions on if there is anything I am missing.  Background - we are a 40 year old couple from the south island in NZ leaving the kids home for a break away together. We can't do a lot of walking as my husband has a condition that leads to massive fatigue even though we would love to and used to do a lot only a year ago.    Day 1 - Arrive Hobart collect vehicle and make our way through the Coal Valley vineyards up to Richmond and then into Port Arthur. McHenry Distillery before Port Arthur tour. (130km)  Day 2 - Head to Bicheno via Tasman National park (stop at sights) Around midday we hit some vineyards up around Boomer Creek and Milton. (248km)  Day 3 - Morning set off to Cape Tourville lighthouse (if we are up early enough for sunrise) breakfast in Wineglass bay/coles bay area. Then mosie on up to East coast Natureworld (My husband wants to do the sugar glider experience like a giant child - apologies in advance to any kids who are there on the same day sigh) Binalong bay overnight in Barnbougle dunes golf course (this is a stop for my husbands benefit). This is a long day. (319km)  Day 4 - Hubby might play a short round of golf or have a hit at the driving range (he used to be a cyclist - 180km rides no problem golf is about all he can manage now and it makes him happy so i'd prefer no comments about how it's a waste to play golf when there are other things we could be doing.) Head up to Darby-Norris distillery (maybe the floating sauna - it is not available the day before so have to backtrack) then off to Cataract gorge for the afternoon. Launceston. (119km)  Day 5 - Wine tour in Tamar valley (is that right?? Down the side of cataract gorge..).  Day 6 - Mole Creek caves Hellyers distillery guide falls pencil pine falls Knyvet falls cradle mountain. This route goes inland then veers to the coast before coming back up. We can't really fit in Gunns Plains caves but we can either do mole creek OR Gunns Plains on this route. I got the impression that Mole Creek would be better... is this accurate? Another long day. (320km)  Day 7 - Morning around cradle mountain before heading off to Nelson falls Frenchmans cap suspended (should it be called suspension...?) bridge Lake St Clair Tarraleah estate. Should we add the rack & gorge train trip? The overnight stop is more to break up the trip and get some sleep so we probably have the time. (264km)  Day 8 - Lawrenny estate distillery Russell falls Horseshoe falls Tahune adventures Hastings caves (is it worth the detour to Hastings caes? We would likely have to stay around here somewhere). (260km)  Day 9 - Bruny Island (assuming we can take the rental car on the ferry otherwise somewhere around Kettering). (142km)  Day 10 - Bruny Island cruise. Not a whole lot of time in Hobart if we do the cruise but it looks like it would be worth doing. These places in Hobart are of interest if we have time. Mount Wellington Mona Lark & Sullivans cove distillery before flying out domestically at 6:55pm. (138km)    So that's the itinerary. We tend to spend more time on the go than wandering around the overnight stops when we do a roadtrip. I realise this is not everyone's cup of tea but it is how we like to do things. Otherwise we'd go somewhere like Fiji where it is warm and lounge on the beach but we would get bored.  If there is anything you can see here that is glaringly not going to work or we have missed something major out please let me know :) Open to suggestions from experts. Tasmania is one place I do not know a whole lot about.  Oh and also please tell me the snakes will mostly be sleeping at the end of May (we fly in on the 21st). ,CeeJaye33,Tasmania,"Christchurch, New..."

Apologies if this is a double post - I thought I posted earlier but now I can't find it so I think I may have missed hitting submit!    My husband and I are planning our first trip to Australia in October for a week. We don't get a ton of vacation time so we're looking to maximize our experience while in Sydney. We're currently looking at hotels like the four seasons and the langham merely because we are familiar with the brands. We were pleasantly shocked by how many hotels we had to choose from that are considered 5 star and now we are at a loss for where to stay!    Our hopes for a hotel are (this is maybe silly/obvious):  1. convenient location  2. great service/cleanliness (obviously most high ranking hotels would likely be very clean but thought it may be worth mentioning)    We are a younger couple with no children - we have no problem with kids around at all but understand that hotels that are more family oriented may naturally be noisier and we are hoping for something more on the quiet side.    As for our trip we aim to see some of the more popular sites (Sydney harbour/opera house taronga zoo etc...) but we usually just like eating at fun (not necessarily fancy) spots shopping and wandering around the city.    We are super open to suggestions for places worth staying (and also not opposed for spots to eat/drink/shop/explore!)    Thanks in advance for any and all advice for us newbies! ,kms604,Sydney,"Vancouver, Canada"

Does the park close gates meaning i can't exit after sunset or enter before sunrise?  Planning on renting accomodation just outside the park. We are flying from Sydney and won't have camping equipment so its just easier.  How many days is good enough to explore all the day hikes? I was thinking 5 days is that too much or too little? We are keen to do hikes up to 4hrs or more. And the short ones too.    And really really hoping to experience a few sunsets (and potentially a sunrise) and drive home after dark. Is this possible or are there park gates that are locked which makes it impossible?    I tried calling the visitor center to ask but was on hold forever.

Hi I am planning a trip to from Launceston(Tas) to Burnie. Is that safe to do a night drive with a start time of 8PM from Launceston to Burnie on Bass Highway?    Are there any dangers of wildlife at that time of the night?  Is the Bass Highway well lit at night after 8 pm? ,Jacob,Tasmania,
Heading from the Shire to the Gold Coast in a few months and planning some stop overs but we are wanting to stop in nice small town settings instead of the usual destinations like Port Macqaurie and Coffs Harbour. Any suggestions? ,Daniella I,New South Wales,"Earlwood, Australia"
Like many in this group I routinely travel with a 28 Degrees Mastercard and a Citibank Visa Debit card. With the massive cyber attack and loss of identity documents that's occurred recently affecting 28 Degrees/Latitude I was wondering if I'd overlooked any other credit cards that don't charge foreign transaction fees.    Citibank has been taken over by NAB so fingers crossed that the Visa Debit card still permits withdrawals from ATMs off shore or card payments without incurring extra fees.    Thanks for any advice. ,Nibbles55,Sydney,"Woonona, Australia"

Hi any recommendations for hotel near train station and CBD area? 2 adults and 2 children (4 and 1 years old? Thanks ,Jerry_PJR,Sydney,"Singapore, Singapore"
In Brisbane for 2 nights in August (Fri-Sat) with my partner. Just there to catch up with a friend. But instead of keeping costs down we thought maybe we should splash out and make it more of a romantic weekend away.    I‚Äôve looked up luxury hotels but how do you narrow it down?    Happy to spend about $600-$700 per night. We won‚Äôt be doing much sight seeing (beyond good restaurants) so happy to spend time relaxing at the hotel. Like somewhere that looks and feels nice and comfortable and a bit fancy. Don‚Äôt care about pool. Good restaurant is a plus. ,GhostofMars,Brisbane,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi Team  Apologies if this has been asked before (or if it's a bit obvious/ridiculous) but I have trouble with searching the forums here. So I was having a look at having a long weekend away in Melbourne (from Brisbane) and have booked a theatre ticket for the 18th June at Her Majesty's Theatre. But I've just seen that Carlton are playing the Suns on that arvo so was just wondering whether it would be possible.    For reference: Game is a 1pm start at the MCG and the theatre show starts at 6.30pm. Not being too familiar with Melbourne (or how long AFL games go) I was just wondering whether it was possible to attend both while getting dinner in between?    TIA :) ,Theatrefan24601,Melbourne,"Brisbane, Australia"

Hi all myself & my wife are looking for advice/recommendations on where to stay in our camper-van during our trip around the southwest region. We pick up our 2 berth camper-van in Perth on 27th November returning it on the 4th December. For our 8 day/7-night trip are planning on overnighting around Margaret River region Pemberton Denmark & Albany areas ( & somewhere else tbd that will make our drive back to Perth a little easier on the last day.    At this point in our 6-week holiday we will have stayed in city centre apartments (Sydney) villas (Jervis Bay) with friends (Victoria) & hotels (Melbourne & Perth ) so we are looking forward to trying a week in a camper-van something we have never done before.    We enjoy taking our time visiting the local points of interest some good walks in national parks beaches craft shops and a nice lunch and we have earmarked some wonderful looking locations to visit on our intended route. However we‚Äôre unsure about the type & location of overnight accommodation we should go for. We are looking for smallish sites that are quiet (we‚Äôll have no toilet/shower in our van so will depend on the campsite facilities) It would be good to have a mix of town and more remote locations.(perhaps in the national parks?) We‚Äôre assuming there‚Äôs a fair chance the weather will be favourable around that time of year and we‚Äôre avoiding the school holidays. Also any thoughts on how soon we should book these sites in advance. As always suggestions from TA‚Äôs would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ,Jac123Carrickfergus,Western Australia,Carrickfergus
Hi all‚Ä¶I‚Äôm coming to Darwin in July and want to hire a vehicle for 10 days. I‚Äôm becoming aware that some companies won‚Äôt allow you to drive on unsealed roads so is it possible to find a company that allows you to be a tourist and drive on shingle roads? I‚Äôm not talking completely off roads but some of the places I want to visit are on roads that don‚Äôt look like they are sealed. I‚Äôm lo9ing at 49ers options?Has anyone got any suggestions on where we can rent a vehicle which will allow this? Not so worried about unlimited kms but will want to get out into the country and want to be covered. Thank you. ,Champ01,Darwin,"Christchurch, New..."

Hi  We are a family with 2 young kids looking for a nice apt for a week. We stayed at Frangipani last year to be near the beach but the kids loved the buggy so much we are keen to try somewhere more new and renovated with gorgeous views. I like the look of the Edge or Hidden Cove. Apart from the number of bedrooms I was hoping to get some feedback on the 2 especially if you have stayed in both. Is the private beach at Hidden Cove nice? Which pool is better? I know neither heated but is one reasonably warm? Any other differences to help me make up my mind?  Many thanks ,ChelseaCasper,Hamilton Island,"Sydney, Australia"

I want to purchase tickets for the 15 December 2023 performance. There are stalls tickets available in row H26 (A Reserve) for $105 and R14 (Premium) for $129.    In my theatre going experience H26 looks good to me and I would expect it to cost more than R14 although I am not familiar with the Sydney Opera House seating. Can someone with experience please give me guidance on what they would consider is the better location for a concert of this nature?    Thank you. ,YORKI,Sydney,United Kingdom

My husband and I arrive from Hervey bay at 2 pm on Nov 27 into Cairns and will leave for Brisbane on the 30th Nov by the 4:40 pm flight to Brisbane.  So basically cannot do much on the 27th in terms of activities except around the city.  On the 28th planning on a outer barrier reef trip. We will not scuba dive but willing to snorkel and just look around. Which tour would you recommend for that?  On the 29th planning Mossman and Daintree- self drive.  Now my question is about the trip to Kuranda.  Would it be possible to take the first scenic train trip out there and return back by the skyrail( gondola) back in time to catch the 4:40 pm flight. Our hotel is 7 Kms from Cairns airport so we will pick up our luggage then drop off car.    TIA ,A J,Cairns,

Hello all! I am looking forward to coming to Australia again after over 10 years!  This is my first time travelling this part of Australia and would love to get some preliminary ideas of how I can plan my self--drive holiday without missing out on the quaint little towns and experiences!  I am starting first with a 5N stay in Frementle to chillax & enjoy the town & Perth a bit.  Thereafter with a remaining 11 days rent a car from Bayswater Frementle to explore southern west region up to Albany & even to Esperance!  I have no idea whether I will have time to drive leisurely all the way to Esperance then back to frementle via inland highway dropping by Kalgoorlie & other top sights? Or should I not be too ambitious & only drive up to Albany & take the inland highway back to frementle?  My husband is the only driver & we intend to stop often to rest enjoy the place frequently driving maybe at most 4 hours a day. Do I need to book accommodation in advance at this time of year?  Any proposed itineraries? Please suggest the quaint towns to visit. My interests are in scenery unique experiences eating delicious meat pies and exploring charming little towns. Will it be too cold to swim then? Else it will be fantastic to explore the beautiful beaches too!  Thank you so much! ,sg1traveller,Western Australia,Singapore
Hi would appreciate some advice.  We are getting a Greyhound bus from Brisbane to Noosa. A couple of seniors with cases around 15kg each. We are booked in Noosa Blue.  What is the easiest way to get from the bus to the hotel? I'm having problems picturing it. Seemed to me about 700 meters to far to bo walk if it's hot but is it too short for taxi or Uber.

Hi my parents are into seeing farms and livestock berry or fruit picking and things like that. A few google search suggested to visit Huonville. What are the suggested things to do there? Would there be local farms that are open for visitors to wander around and take a look?    Also I understand the road is split into two: one towards Port Huon and the other to Woodstock/Cradoc. Which one is more scenic and has more things to do/see?    Would there be another alternative town to visit instead of Huonville? I will be staying 3 days in Hobart and 3 days in Launceston ,Pitbull999,Tasmania,Singapore
Hello- We're a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teen girls) travelling to Australia for the first time (two days in March and 1st two weeks of April 2024)- about 15 nights.  We want to do 5N in Sydney 2N Melbourne2N GOR-drive with stops in Apollo Bay and Port Campbell 2N Grampians (sleep in Halls Gap) and 3N Cairns (sleep in Port Douglas).  Have the following questions  1. Are we packing too much into 15 days - and should we spend more time near Sydney/Melbourne and drop Cairns ? If yes what would the group suggest ( we love outdoors beaches/nature)  2. We wanted to rent a car in Melbourne do the GOR and Grampians and drop the car at Melbourne again to catch the flight to Cairns. Is this advisable?  3. The time of year (early April) - would we be able to do any snorkeling or scuba at the reef - heard about stingers and weather not being so great.  Thanks for your help ,travelvidhya,,"Bengaluru, India"
We (55+ hubby and wife) planning on our first trip to Australia in March 2024. Fly into Sydney. Fly out? March 16 - 24 will is a planned back country guided adventure bike ride for the hubby leaving Sydney and ending up in Melbourne. We have an additional 12 days to sight see elsewhere. Which we can do prior/after/or split up. Should we rent a car and do the Great Ocean Road? Or fly to Cairn and do the Great Barrier Reef? What about Sydney and Melbourne? How many days to visit them? Is there a high speed train between cities?    We enjoy eye candy the most. Taking in the sights. Soaking in the culture. Not wine drinkers beach layers museum goers or hikers.

We‚Äôre a family with younger kids (10 & 7) going to be passing by Jervis bay as part of a day trip in the first week of July. Looking to get a glimpse of some whales hopefully from shore. Not interested in a cruise    Wondering what would be the best place to potentially see them from.    I‚Äôve done a little light reading and Point Perpendicular Lighthouse seems to be a good high ground. Would anyone confirm or suggest options?    But also read whales and their calves have been known to come into the bay also. In that situation where in the bay would be best for viewing?    Can any locals or those passing by the the last week comment?    Thank you! ,Ben Q,Jervis Bay,"Sydney, Australia"

Hi all    My girlfriend and I are planning our month-and-a-half Australian trip in November/December.    So far we have planned it all without too many problems. But we really don't know what to do for our road trip which will take place from 2 to 15 December. We will travel from Cairns to Brisbane.    Our first question is that we don't really know what to choose between a car and booking several motels and cabins on camping site or renting a campervan.    From what I've read here the car can be a lot easier more comfortable and more affordable. However a campervan will give us more flexibility. Thanks to the flexibility we think we don't have to book early each night of the road trip.    Things that we didn't know are at this time of year with a campervan will it be flexible with campersite? Or we'll need to book everything in advance to avoid problems like finding no place to sleep for the night.    If we need to book everything early due to the period prone to tourism I think a simple car is better. I haven't checked every night price for campersite cabins or motel but $130 AUD/night is a realistic expectation?    Furthermore I would like to know if we have not missed anything important in our program for this car trip and if you have any suggestion tell us.    We plan to see Mission Beach Wallaman Falls Magnetic Island Airlie Beach Hervey Bay Great Sandy National Park Sunshine Coast then drop off the car or campervan in Brisbane.    Thank you ! ,ghisg,,"Paris, France"

Hi in the last 2 years have stayed at Reefsleep (Whitsundays) Heron Island Lady Elliot Island and Lady Musgrave HQ (pontoon). Here are my thoughts in comparing!  ACCESS  Reef Sleep 7 (or 10) By helicopter if you want to splurge! Otherwise large ferry in 2hrs through Whitsundays islands and some more open ocean (departs marina Airlie Beach). Trip over smooth but back was hairy with at least 50 passengers vomiting. Special VIP area on boat for O/N guests.  Heron Island 6 By large ferry (34m) in 2hrs departing Gladstone. Variable seas possible - but our trip minimal passengers vomiting (5-10).  Lady Musgrave 6 By large ferry (35m) in 2 and a bit hours departing Bundaberg. Trip over smooth but back some movement with a number of passengers vomiting (20-30). Special VIP area on boat for O/N passengers.  Lady Elliot 10 By plane (and priced accordingly but packages often available) with multiple departure points (Bundaberg/Hervey Bay/Redcliffe Brisbane/Gold Coast). Awesome flight with island and reef views.    ACCOMMODATION  Reef Sleep 8 (or 10) Options are tents on platform with queen beds and water views etc or 2x underwater suites available. Underwater is highly recommended but books out early so plan ahead. Note dedicated area available for O/N guests which day trippers do not have access to.  Heron Island 6 Various accommodation options but questionable value for money in stepping up and all looked tired with minimal evidence of ongoing investment. Recommendation book cheapest and spend money eleswhere during stay.  Lady Musgrave 8 Tents for 2 on upper platform with water views (believe there is a group booking option of bunk beds in underwater observatory). Note when day trippers are on platform they have access to accommodation deck.  Lady Elliot 6 to 8 More economical permanent (and nice) tents using camp toilets through to cabins and luxury glamping tents. Cheap tents are fine but if you require own facilities then most other rooms looked to be recently updated. Not convinced on Glamping tents as if wind coming in wrong direction (as it was for the 6 days we were on island) then it would not be a pleasant spot to be (also no real beach - in front is shallow tidal lagoon).    FOOD  Reef Sleep 9 Dedicated chef - awesome food + great handling of dietary requirements. Sunset canapes were a nice touch!  Heron Island 8 Restaurant - buffet breakfast or Al la carte lunch/dinner with decent selection and consistent quality. Adaptations to meet dietry requirements possible. Other options include food at bar (sandwiches etc) and a kiosk (potato chips ice creams etc).  Lady Musgrave 8 Chef who also doubled as a dive master during the day. Great food quality and dietary requirements fully catered for. Additional options to daytripper lunch buffet available for O/N guests.  Lady Elliot 5 Al a carte available but most packages include access to a buffet style with a set few selections. Always something available to satisfy dietry requirements but could be limited (e.g veges but no protein). Tip - ask to speak to the chef! He was very helpful whereby the serve staff were pretty much responding it is what it is. Food quality alternated between good and this gives me flashbacks to school camp.    ACTIVITIES  Reef Sleep 6 Free: Semi submersible snorkel. Additional charge: guided snorkel diving helicopter flights (heart reef etc).  Heron Island 8 Free: Reef walk UQ research tour (was pretty generic) lagoon snorkel. Additional charge: Snorkel outside lagoon Diving day spa (recommended). Also possible to go to nearby Wilson Island as an add on staying in luxury tents (expensive).  Lady Musgrave 7 Free: glass bottom boat island tour  Lady Elliot 7 Free: reef walk sustainabilty tour birding tour glass bottom boat lighthouse. Additional charge: Glass bottom boat (after first free one) diving    HANGING OUT  Reef Sleep 7 to 10 Multi story platform with sea and reef views + underwater observatory great sunset viewing.  Heron Island 8 Bar + alfresco area jetty shark bay (great beach) east side beach (tidal) swimming pool (scenic location) and a couple of different sunsets options  Lady Musgrave 6 2 level pontoon (top level subject to wind) underwater observatory (average viewing).  Lady Elliot 7 Undercover seating adjacent to restaurant swimming pool (average location) west side for sunset    SNORKELLING  Reef Sleep 5 Snorkelling in prescribed area is decidedly average (lost interest after 10 mins) there is apparently an option for O/N guests for a guided snorkel to a different area but did not experience (preferring to maximise time in underwater room!)  Heron Island 7 Snorkelling from shore is average but ship wrecks adds interest + a few coral growths and fish. Boat required to snorkel lagoon drop off/outer edge (extra charge) and is ok but not amazing. Expect to find reasonable coral and fish outside the lagoon and did come across a black tip shark. Shark bay at the end of the island has a beautiful beach and swimming and yes lots of sharks coming past but they were fairly antisocial so upon getting onto the water they would zoom away. A bit of a bonus surprise was walking the jetty late at night (fullish moon) where there were rays/turtles/sharks gliding around everywhere.  Lady Musgrave 8 Snorkelling within a designated area but very large and with variety. Some bommies coral ledges and walls. Never feels super crowded even when daytrippers are on board but obviously the magic is being able to look around before they arrive or after they leave. Super easy access from the pontoon.  Lady Elliot 9 Lagoon snorkelling (tidal) possible to see a few things but the best snorkelling is the open side. Note this is also tidal with 3 different entry points from shore (or you can take the glass bottom boat out and launch from there - one trip is free per stay but charge for additional) and you just need to be a bit careful as trying to return in as the tide is going out the entry channel is difficult. This is probably the best shore accessible snorkelling I've encountered in the world. You will see lots of healthy coral - some of the gardens are very large and sloping. Also plenty of fish and some great close encounters with turtles. Although Lady Elliot is billed the home of the manta ironically in 5 days we didn't see one!? (visited beginning of May).    SUSTAINIBILITY  Reef Sleep 7 Company is Eco certified but unsure about pontoon specifics.  Heron Island 2 Self referenced eco resort but no evidence of such (have diesel generator as power source). There is an option to decline room cleaning and receive a voucher for 1 drink initiative but is that being green or minimising expenses?  Lady Musgrave 9 Billed as being 100% carbon neutral.  Lady Elliot 8 Ongoing program towards carbon neutral. Have solar and battery as main source of power with diesel generator as back up.    STAFF/SERVICE  Reef Sleep 9 Super attentive - definately felt like VIPs  Heron Island 7 Mainly foreign backpackers with variable levels of interest/enthusiam (but some were excellent)  Lady Musgrave 8 Boat and pontoon crew were all great!  Lady Elliot 7 Generally pretty helpful - a bit too much cheese on some of the spiels (again a school camp vibe).    TOTAL SCORE  Reef Sleep 7 (or 9) Best for (with underwater room) most amazing experience.  Heron Island 7 Best for general holiday on a beautiful island with wider options. Easy access to see coral and fish (with possible turtles/sharks/rays) that would satisfy casual snorkellers or children  Lady Musgrave 8 Unique experience and superb unlimited snorkelling. Price when facility opened seemed fair but has now increased so it's pretty expensive.  Lady Elliot 8.5 Best for when snorkelling is your ultimate priority (note tide dependence) ,johnnycamps,Great Barrier Reef,
I‚Äôm planning to spend 5 days/6 nights in Hobart in early November.    It‚Äôs 35 years since I last visited so i dare say much has changed! I did a tour to port Arthur last time and I‚Äôm not planning on going back there.    I‚Äôm looking for advice on places I can easily do by public transport or walk to as I can‚Äôt drive or ride a bike.    I like art history gardens coastal or riverside walks boat trips good food and wine.    MONA and the botanical gardens are on my list and I see that there are more galleries and museums than i remember so that should fill a few days. I‚Äôm also thinking of boooking a day trip with Bruny Island safaris.    Are there any heritage towns that I could reach by bus that you would recommend? What about half day or full day sailing trips?    I haven‚Äôt picked my accomodation yet but it will be very central and I‚Äôm hoping I can walk to mst of the main attractions in town.    Thanks in advance for an suggestions ,AmoMondo,Hobart,"Edinburgh, United..."
Hi all. I'd like some advice please. I‚Äôll be in Perth in November and after spending a few days in the city doing some sightseeing some relaxing possibly a couple of nights in Freemantle/Rottnest Island and daytrips to Swan Valley and the Pinnacles I was thinking of hiring a car to drive a loop round the south west.    I found a suggested self-drive route of Perth>Mandurah (1 night)>Margaret River (3 nights)>Pemberton (2 nights)>Albany (2 nights)>Esperance (2 nights)>Kalgoorie (2 nights)>Perth.    I was thinking of maybe skipping the night in Mandurah and heading straight to Margaret River.  On looking at the driving distances involved though I‚Äôm thinking some of these legs are long and potentially ambitious. I‚Äôm travelling solo so will also be doing all the driving myself.  ‚Ä¢ Perth to Margaret River 3 hours  ‚Ä¢ Margaret River to Pemberton 1.5 hrs  ‚Ä¢ Pemberton to Albany 2.5 hrs  ‚Ä¢ Albany to Esperance 5 hrs  ‚Ä¢ Esperance to Kalgoorie 4 hours  ‚Ä¢ Kalgoorie to Perth 6 hours    So a few questions:  ‚Ä¢ Generally is that route safe (as safe as anywhere anyway) to drive solo or should I be more cautious in either route or overall distance? The route north to Kalgoorie looks quite remote and I don't want to spend days driving worrying about breaking down and being stranded in the middle of absolutely nowhere...  ‚Ä¢ Is the whole journey length ambitious in the time I have or any individual legs too far (it‚Äôs the 5 and 6 hour ones in particular concerning me the 4 hour would be fine stopping at various places on the way)  ‚Ä¢ If the overall route and stopovers make sense but some legs too long any suggestions for good places to stop a night to break the longest journeys?  ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm wondering if I should drop Kalgoorie and drive straight back to Perth inland from Esperance maybe overnighting around Wave Rock. The goldfields/history plus the super pit all look really interesting but just wonder if the distance to drive plus remoteness to get to Kalgoorie is the step too far?

Hi all    We will fly into Sunshine Coast airport from Sydney and drive to Hervey Bay then spending 3 nights on Fraser Island.    We would prefer to avoid going on tour groups etc. and thinking about renting a 4WD to drive on Fraser Island. However the car rental company that we tend to use East Coast Rental does not allow taking the car to an island including Fraser.    Any suggestions on another car rental company we can look into?

Hello all my partner and I are planning a five-night holiday in Adelaide and surrounds in mid-August this year. We enjoy food & wine so the plan is to visit wine country (probably Adelaide Hills and Barossa) as well as a day or so in Adelaide itself. We‚Äôre currently thinking we‚Äôll need to both hire a car (although haven‚Äôt priced yet) and book small group day/half-day wine tasting tours. We considered the Fleurieu peninsula (which I‚Äôve wanted to visit ever since seeing ‚ÄòThe Boys are Back‚Äô) but can‚Äôt see there is enough time. I‚Äôve not been to Adelaide since I was a child and my partner has never been so keen for any advice please on how to approach our itinerary. Thank you! ,Melanie P,Adelaide,"Brisbane, Australia"

Are there any hotels that offer a day pass? I've searched the internet and I can't find any hotels in Sydney listed on the several day pass websites. We are getting off a cruise ship in December and our flight isn't until 5pm so I'd prefer to walk around Sydney versus sitting at the airport all day before getting on a 17 hour flight. We will have been in Sydney for several days before we get on the ship so it's more about storing luggage being able to walk around get some lunch and then maybe shower before heading to the airport. ,BEACH_HOME_111,Sydney,"Rockwall, Texas"

Hi everyone    I'm planning an approx 2 week trip with my partner in November. We have never visited before.    I've started looking at flights from London (where we live) and at the moment isn't too pricy to fly into Perth Cairns Sydney Melbourne Darwin and Adelaide. However this makes it so hard to decide where to go or even begin.    I've also been reading a lot about the differences between the east and west to see what might be more suitable for us. We are happy to rent a car or do internal flights. However I still can't decide!    We aren't crazy about visiting the cities and are only really looking to stay for a couple of days in one of them. What we are interested in is nature beaches culture history food deserts rainforests etc.    Could anyone help me before my brain explodes. ,Claire,,
We will be in Adelaide in mid August and hope we have a day that‚Äôs good for biking. We plan to do a little wine tasting in Barossa Valley but we need to balance it with something for our kids (ages 10 and 13). I was thinking biking would be fun. Has anyone done this with their kids? Is renting e bikes possible? I know there are biking tours but I‚Äôd like something we can do on our own time ,CalBear_02,Greater Adelaide,"San Francsico, CA"
Starting early September we will be travelling from Perth to Darwin your pretty standard trip along the coast all the way up to Exmouth and then heading west on the GRR before diverting north to Darwin. Now I have always been fascinated with trains especially with freight trains and I know that in Australia I can potentially see some of the longest trains in the world so I wonder: am I somewhere going to cross or drive parallel to freight train tracks? And if so is there a chance to get information when and where trains may pass?    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,,"Cologne, Germany"
Hi everyone  I am looking for accommodation for late April for my husband and I. Initially I thought Noosa Heads beachfront but after reading tons of reviews on the hotels/self catering places it seems every one has issues with restaurant and bar noise very late at night and garbage pick up very early due to being right on Hastings Street. If that‚Äôs the case it‚Äôs not for us.  I looked at the ones across from the beach too and the same issues are there since they front Hasting Street.    That‚Äôs leaves me looking for other options. We would like quiet at night walk to restaurants a view if possible and near transport to get to Noosa Heads. We would also like a place that doesn‚Äôt generally have tons of children outside of school holidays. So far I found two that seem ok I guess. They don‚Äôt have a tremendous amount of reviews and most talk about how good it is for their kids.    Does anyone have input on colonial Resort or Noosa pacific Riverside Resort? Or can you suggest other lodgings? I‚Äôm at the point of possibly ditching Noosa altogether since I can‚Äôt find something that I like.    Your help is appreciated. ,23kme,Sunshine Coast,"Long Island, NY"
I'm picking up my family in a few days at Sydney Airport International. We can't do the express zones for pick up so we'll have to park. However we have a car with a small luggage trailer. Is there any area in or near Sydney Airport that we could park with our trailer? Thanks ,Sophia A,Sydney,
Hi    We will be flying into Ayers Rock Airport (from Cairns) in mid-September arriving at 3:30 pm. Six days later we are departing from Alice Springs.    Having problems with car hire. Hertz is open until 4pm and is very expensive. Also there is a reasonable probability that we would arrive at desk after 4pm. Thrifty is somewhat less expensive but closes at 3pm. Cryptically the Thrifty website says The airport counter only operates when a commercial flight is arriving at the Resort at the times specified by the airline. Avis closes earlier than Thrifty.    Questions:    1) Does anyone understand the cryptic Thrifty comment? Will the counter be open when our flight arrives?    2) Can we take the shuttle to the resort and pick up our car rental that evening? (The Thrifty website offers contradictory information in one place saying the office is open until 5pm in another 3pm)    3) I guess the biggest question is - do we need a car rental while at the resort or should we take tours and get the car hire when we leave for our next stop - Kings Canyon (for a stay on the way to Uluru)    4) Finally if the only option is to say pick up the car at the Uluru resort in the morning after our arrival will that interfere with our trip (e.g. sunrise views).    Thanks for all of your help (you folks are great for sharing your experience).    (if this is a repeat post - my apologies. I tried to post earlier and (I think) it didn't go through. ,ScarletKnight81,Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park,Washington DC...
Hey guys    we are a family of four (mum dad and twins aged about 4 to 5 at the time travelling) and plan to visit Australia (Queensland) and Fiji. We will be able to get away from work for about 6-8 weeks. For several reasons we don't want to visit during our european summer (june-september). We are considering to plan our trip either for april/may or october/november.  What would you recommend?  We really are into swimming and beach days but also want to see some national parks.

We will be traveling in a 6 berth motorhome so not the easiest vehicle to find parking for.

We will be in Norfolk Island for one day (7.00am to 6.00pm) in Mid July. I understand the ship may dock in Kingston or Cascade depending on the weather. But I would like to know if tours can be booked independently on the island on the day of arrival? The Cruise line charges for these tours are very expensive and would like to know if we have any choices once we hit the shore instead.  We are interested in the Museums and the convict sites but would also like to see some of the beautiful nature (coastal and inland) that Norfolk Island boasts. Any information would be very much appreciated. (There are just the two of us). ,Maria G,Norfolk Island,"Melbourne, Australia"

Just thought I'd post this here for information.    Like many we like to book this hotel prior to our international flight the next day. So relaxing knowing you just walk across the road to the terminal.    We are travelling to SAfrica in April and putting the trip together atm including booking hotels. I was absolutely stunned to find Rydges charging $340 (305 member price) for their entry level room on a regular Sunday night. We've noticed prices rising over the last year or two but this is getting ridiculous. It's not THAT long ago when rooms could be had for sub-200.

We made a daytrip to Blue Moutains some years ago but this time we are coming back for 3 nights (2 whole days and 2 half days). We are keen walkers and love wonderful scenery.  Our intention is to get the train from sydney to blue mountains. We have been reading posts about things to see and do.  Obviously echo point lookout is at the top of the list but we also would like to visit the garden of stones national park if it works in. Places do seem spread out in the blue mountains and we have looked at the explorer hop on hop off bus.    We love hiking so would appreciate some recommendations for the best location for accommodation and is a car necessary or could we ebike tour or explorer bus without the hassle of a vehicle. What would be your top recommendations for walks and things to see and do in the time we have?

Hi all  for the benefit of future fellow travellers I just wanted to update/clear up some incorrect information that is still found when searching the internet.    Alcohol is NOT duty free on Norfolk. Neither is there any discount for tourists at the Liquor Bond store.

I get issued a couple of Qantas Club Lounge passes each year through my Amex credit card. No problems in the past but this time and to cut a long story short I was unable to link my pass to a flight from Perth to Singapore and received an unhelpful error message each time I tried. Both the pass and flight to link to were shown on the FF website.    Spoke to QFF and they initially advised that the Perth Qantas Club was closed. This was not in effect true as I found through further investigation that it was open. Called them back and this time was told that they were not accepting lounge passes to the Perth Qantas Club - Well done Qantas! Is anybody else having similar problems with other lounges? ,rwlid,,"Perth, Australia"

Driving from Brisbane to Cairns next June so getting an early start on the planning. We've booked Lady Elliot for the start of the trip so will fly into Brisbane rent a car and do a few days in Noosa and then head to Hervey Bay and then Lady Elliot for three nights.

Hi there    in August we will be spending four nights in Sydney. Currently I have booked us into the Sydney Potts Point Central Apartment Hotel. However quite a few people who reviewed this place complain about the small size of their rooms so started looking for alternatives and found Oaks Sydney Goldsbrough Suites. For pretty much the same prize they offer an apartment with city views more than double the size I get at the other place. so naturally I feel tempted to switch unless those of you who know the area will tell me I probably shouldn't.    For example: how do the locations compare? On a map I don't see a huge difference but maybe I am overlooking something. And what about (traffic) noise?    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Sydney,"Cologne, Germany"

Hi need some suggestions on zoos/wildlife parks in Melbourne.    We (2 young adults) intended to visit the Philip island wildlife park on Wednesday or Thursday when we‚Äôre there in aug 2023 but unfortunately the website says that it is closed on both days :(  Reason for choosing this park is because  1) we want to be able to feed the kangaroos/wallabies when they are free roaming around us  2) would not prefer a timed session where you are allowed to enter an enclosure for a period of time to feed them with a zookeeper (like Melbourne zoo).  3) prefer native Australian animals (hence don‚Äôt prefer the safari animals in the werribee park)    Any suggestions based on the above criteria please? ,Iqah,Melbourne,"Singapore, Singapore"

My niece and I are doing a 2-night visit to Uluru in January. That gives us two mornings during which time to explore outside before it gets too hot although our flight leaves at 12:50 pm on day 3 so that morning is shorter. I wanted to ask whether it's possible to do the Walpa Gorge walk and possibly the Valley of Winds walk just to the first overlook in the late afternoon. Does it cool down enough by then? I haven't seen anyone planning that.    We'd like to do that on the afternoon we arrive and then do Field of Lights in the evening.    On our second day we'd do the sunrise + Uluru base walk the Cultural Center a sunset helicopter tour and an astro tour.    On our last morning we'd do a private dot painting workshop (no public workshops that day of the week) or if that doesn't work out a guided Kuniya Walk.    Any feedback would be appreciated! ,kpeacock,Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park,Los Angeles...

Hello  We have planned and booked accommodation for a multiple day trip along the GOR. Planning the days with lots of natural attractions but I was wondering about including either the Otway Fly or LiveWire park especially as we have two teenagers.

Probably don‚Äôt want to go to both? ,Jayne C,Great Ocean Road,"Perth, Australia"

I just took a taxi from Sydney airport to Kent street and was charged AUD73.40.

Hi all  I will be getting the Greyhound bus to Brisbane Domestic Terminal after working in Toowoomba for a few months- with the intention of getting a rental car and heading up to the Sunshine Coast.  I will have a couple of pieces of luggage(trolley cases- ooops possibly too much shopping ;-) ) and would prefer to rent a car from a company who is close to the Greyhound stop (Bus and Coach Zone A1-A2 Peel Way)...to avoid struggling too much with the luggage - I have looked at a company that leaves the car in the Short Term parking building (Parking Building 1 Level 4) ; and also Hertz.  Prices are comparable.  Can anyone advise which would be the closest? I'm thinking probably Hertz and have looked at the Airport map but can't definitively work out which would be the easiest/most convenient/quickest.  Any advice much appreciated:-)  Thanks. ,nzgigi,Brisbane,"Auckland, New..."

Hello    Me and my boyfriend (23 years old) are travelling the east coast of australia end of September from sydney up to cairns by campervan over 5-6 weeks.

We have been looking at a travellers autobarn Kuga which is an older vehicle and then a Ultima 2 Berth Maui which is larger and a newer vehicle. They are very different in budget but are wondering whether it is worth paying the extra for the extra space and a newer vehicle (more reliable and safer).

Hello  we fly to OOL in less than a month just after the winter holiday. Our interest is unique nature and fauna camping in a tent (almost) exclusively. No interesr in cities. No tours save for exceptions no zoos basically nothing paid as we are on tight budget also not much islands unless they are inexpensive to go to. We aim to visit Redcliffe Maleny (platypus) Noosa Hervey Eungella Cape Hillsborough Girringun Mission beach Daintree Atherthon highlands Charters town Carnavoron and Springbrook and Lamington if we have time at the end. Tips for sone 2wd outback destinations for red kangaroos or emus are welcome!    We would like to keep flexibility booking campsite last minute. Is that possible or do we need to do it (well?) in advance? I found an older topic here that said no issues booking a day ahead outside of holiday season but maybe that changed or os wrong...  Thank you. ,Asanoth,Queensland,
Hi all I am travelling for the first time out of Singapore with my 1 year old son (who is walking independently already!) to Perth in November (14 to 21 Nov) and have a few questions. I have shortlisted these places to visit:  - Swan Valley Cuddly Farm  - Caversham Widlife Park  - Fremantle Market  - 3 night stay in MR Holiday Cottages for farm stay experience (during that period theres a min of 3 nights booking required)  - Any Farmers Market  - Have a taste of Lavender Ice Cream at Yallingup  - Maybe visit the Busselton Jetty  - Elizabeth Quay  - Kings Park  - Do some city shopping for experience  We intend to stay in the city area from 14 to 18 Nov and drive down to MR stay on the 18 Nov. We will also be renting a car for the trip.    Questions:  1. Do I need to plan down to the details on where to dine at for all meals? Or would it be better to explore the area and settle for any restaurants near us?    2. Is it recommended that I do Caversham Wildlife Park + Swan Valley on the same day or should I split it to 2 days?    3. Any recommended areas for us to explore during our MR farm stay?    4. What is the weather like during our travel period for day and night and type of suitable clothings?    5. My son has severe allergy to eggs and dairy. Are food choices there allergy friendly or do I have to prepare his meals in advance for him?    6. Happy to receive any other recommendations for smoother travel and planning!    We are not hard on following itineraries but keen to do a free and easy trip where we explore according to areas/places of interest.    Look forward to hear all the input. Thank you in advance! ,Audrey,Perth,

Hi guys!    Some time ago browsing the net I came across photos of a stunning beach in Australia. It had several giant rounded rocks that people routinely sat on or dived into the water from (thing several meters height at least a dozen people easily on top). Article said it was sometimes difficult because people dived there but currents could be tricky and getting back to shore would present a challenge. Now for the life of me I can't find this place on google and my vacation in OZ approaches. Anyone can suggest something? I would be forever grateful. ,≈Åukasz O,,"Brussels, Belgium"

I understand that Virgin Australia use self serve bag drops at Sydney International. We're flying from Sunshine Coast to Sydney with Virgin Australia then on to Denpasar with them six hours later on a separate booking (both on Velocity). I'm hoping to check the bags straight through (there's no mention on the Virgin website about the flights having to be on the same booking). We'll have our international boarding passes as we'll check in online.    My question is: If Virgin won't let us check our bags right through how long in advance can you use the self serve bag drops?

I'm looking at a deal with Vacations To Go for a trans pacific cruise which starts in the US and ends in Australia. They are offering a very good deal for solo cruisers offered me a specific cabin and have quoted me in AUD and the quote includes Government Taxes. I remember a thread on this forum about Vacations to Go which was generally positive but I can't find it.  I feel there must be a catch to the good quote. Will they add in Port Taxes or Gratuities or something else that wouldn't happen if I booked with an Australian travel agent??  It's one of those less than 90 days deals so I have to pay the full amount if I accept. Anyone had any experience with this company? ,yvwords,,Greater Melbourne...

Hello forum!    We just returned from a wonderful time in Oz - first timers for our family of 4 (2 kids ages 9 and 12). I began planning about a year ago and gained so much advice and wisdom from this forum - I hope to pay it forward. Apologies for the length.    SYDNEY - 3 NIGHTS  Transport - uber from airport to CBD ~ A$45.  Stay - Radisson Blu in CBD. Excellent location walking distance to circular quay the Opera House Harbour Bridge The Rocks Barangaroo and so many restaurant options.  Excursions:  - On arrival day we hopped on a ferry from Circular Quay to Manly beach as recommended. The kids needed a little coaxing with gelato to push through the jetlag but we are so glad we did. The views on the ferry and Manly beach itself were dreamy. Definitely worth the ease and few dollars for the ferry ride.  - Our second day we rented a car from Sixt in Woolloomooloo (walking distance from our hotel) and did a day trip to Blue Mountains. The drive was about an hour and 45 min and we decided to go straight to Scenic World first. We did the skytram first walked to the top of Katoomba falls then skytram back. We followed this with the railway (kid's favorite! We did this one twice up and down) walkway cablecar. In all it was about 3 hrs to finish all the rides and walks including twice on the railway. We had just enough time to squeeze in a stop at Echo Point for photo ops of the 3 sisters and a hike to Empress Falls. This hike was about 1 mile round trip but all stairs and about a 46 flight descent and incline so definitely a challenging one!  - Our last day in Sydney we met with a lovely Sydney greeter named Libby to took us around the Rocks neighborhood. She was so great - gave us so much insight to Sydney's history landmarks easter eggs hidden in the streets and was so flexible with the kids. She was such a lovely example of Aussie generosity and hospitality. I can't recommend the Sydney greeters enough. In the afternoon we did the Bondi to Bronte walk - lovely seaside views and photo ops. That evening we had tickets to the symphony at the Opera House. Still jetlagged the kids managed to stay awake for at least half the performance but I truly enjoyed the experience!    ULURU - 3 NIGHTS  Transport - Jetstar car rental Thrifty Uluru booked as early as possible  Stay - Desert Gardens also booked as early as possible  Excursions:  - we tried all the complimentary tours: Didgeridoo lesson garden walk to learn about the native plants dot painting bush foods bush yarns. They were all very informative and educational lasting about 30-60 min.  - Hiking Kata Tjuta - Valley of the Winds. This was our favorite hike of the area as the hike meanders between the boulders and the views change with each turn. We made it to the second lookout point with amazing views in front and behind us!  - Sunset Camel Ride to Uluru - this was one of my favorite experiences of the entire trip. We learned so much about camels and love their docile nature. The color changes of Uluru and the sky during sunset is just magical. Highly recommend this experience.  - Guided Mala walk - the guides and storytelling was good. But the group was about 60 people and sometimes it was hard to hear. I think if you'd prefer to skip the crowd you can do the Mala walk and read the signs along the way which shared fairly similar information as the guides.  - Biking Uluru - its a 15km ride from the cultural center and you must go counterclockwise. Pedestrians get right of way. It's not an easy ride - the bikes are creaky beach cruisers and the path is sometimes deeper in sand than you think. You are swatting at desert flies the entire time. I did enjoy the views but this was not my favorite experience. They are also strict on your return time when booking your time slot so try not to be late.  - Field of Lights - we didn't book the dinner but just the entrance to the light installation. They will bus you there in about 10 min and it takes about 30 min to walk the longer loop. We caught a glimpse of the drone light show in the distance. This was fine - nice to be out in the desert night with acres of lights installed - all solar powered which is impressive.    PORT DOUGLAS - 5 NIGHTS  Transport - Qantas (much better than Jetstar!) car rental at Budget Cairns airport booked as early as possible  Stay - By the Sea. Cannot recommend this place enough. On Macrossan St steps from the beach and close to all the restaurants and shops. They also provide complimentary everything (wagons beach umbrellas chairs floaties boogie boards drink coolers bikes - you name it!) All apartments equipped with kitchen washer dryer.  Excursions:  - Wildlife Habitat Breakfast with the Birds - I'm so glad we did this! We were wowed by the birds but also the active koalas are having breakfast with us. We have access to the koala enclosure during this experience. The breakfast was delicious as well. We enjoyed the rest of the park fed the roos watched the croc show fed a cassowary and learned so much about these native animals. The entry ticket is good for 5 days and Breakfast with the Birds ticket will give you 20% off photos as well.  - Quicksilver Reef Tour - after much deliberation I decided to go with Quicksilver for the sake of the kids. I'm so glad we did - they loved the semi-submersible which gave us an incredible first look at the reef. It was absolutely jawdropping - walls and walls of healthy colorful and abundant reef fish clams 1 small shark. We all wore full-body lycra suits provided but within 5 minutes in the water my 9 yo was stung on the cheek by a blue bottle jellyfish. It caused a welt on his face which we iced and eventually it went away. But it scared him enough to not get back into the water. He ended up just enjoying the semi-submersible ride again with my husband. My daughter and I went on a guided snorkel tour but in retrospect I wish I didn't. Her snorkel mask kept leaking I kept trying to adjust it for her and we kept losing the group and missing all the information by the guide. I also wish they gave us more time at the reef. With lunch changing into the lycra suit fitting in the 30 min semisubmersible ride we only have about 1-1.5 hrs in the water before the ship blew the horn. Looking back I would still choose quicksilver with kids but not do a guided snorkel tour. If adults only I would have opted for Wavelength.  - Daintree self drive: we started with Solar Whisper Daintree river cruise - great experience! Spotted about 4-5 crocs many birds a snake and learned much about the Daintree area. We next went to the Discovery Centre which we really enjoyed with their aerial walkways and audio tour. We stopped by Alexandra lookout and barely made it to our Cape Trib Farm exotic fruit tasting tour. The tour lasted nearly 2 hrs and we tried about a dozen exotic fruits from Asia South America (sadly none were native to Australia) and then toured the farm. Our last stop was the Daintree Ice Cream Co - had some of the same exotic fruit flavors - very yummy and fresh.  - Mossman Gorge: we decided to self tour this one and did the Rainforest Circuit walk (2.4 km). It's quite rugged but lovely and fairly level. No wild cassowaries seen.  - 4 mile beach: lovely warm water beach that is quite shallow and fun for the kids. The water is a bit murky and I was half thinking about crocs swimming about. But they assured us that they do drone flyovers and have lifeguards watching for croc sightings.    SYDNEY - 1 NIGHT  - On our last night in Sydney we enjoyed Vivid. A couple of the locals advised us to walk the tunnel from Wynyard to Barangaroo have dinner at one of the many harborside casual eateries and enjoy the lights. It was fantastic advice. After dinner my favorite part of the night was taking the ferry from Barangaroo to Circular Quay at night to cross under the bridge from the west side and approaching the Opera house from the bridge side. This ferry trip though short in distance was really worth it as they make multiple stops and you have so many photo ops of the bridge and the opera house approach.    In all we loved every leg of our Australia trip. I loved the energy excitement beauty and history of Sydney. We all loved the camels the spirituality and the uniqueness of Uluru (but honestly we loved Kata Tjuta more). The kids loved Port Douglas with the animals the beach scene the rainforest. The reef was just unbelievable. And everywhere we went everyone was so kind friendly helpful and we felt fully safe and welcomed everywhere.    What a lovely country and I hope we will make it back some day.    TIPS FOR AMERICANS / OBSERVATIONS  We went completely cashless. Everything is so easy with a credit card tap.  Non-tipping culture - but service was still so nice!  Rolls mean Sandwiches!  Vegemite is great when spread very thinly on buttered toast  Bondi is pronounced Bond-EYE  Quay is pronounced KEY  Look for an on-off switch for the electric outlet. I didn't realize sometimes the outlets need to be turned on until I found my phone didn't charge all night.    Best of luck to future planners. ,dreamersball,,"Tustin, California"

Our family will be visiting Brisbane in mid-July for 6 days staying at a hotel near the Brisbane City Botanical Gardens.    My wife I and my two teenagers (18 and 16) are all healthy and avid hikers. We love day hikes 3 to 12 miles in length. What day-hikes do you recommend? Beach hikes are good too.    The plan is to leave the hotel early in the morning drive or take transportation to the trailhead and then be back at the hotel for a late dinner. We will each carry lunch and water in our backpacks. Appreciate your help in advance. ,Mark W,Brisbane,"Madison, Wisconsin"

Looking at 2 weeks mid Nov to end Nov.  Car hire very expensive on the majors compared to recent hirings in Melb and Syd and mostly EV which having doubts as most charging stations only 1 charger (can imagine queue with lots of hirers in EV cars).  Is there a local car hire with reasonable prices and non EV? Thanks. ,John V,Hobart,"Ballajura, Australia"
well unfortunately not a positive review. Hired from 'Cheaper' and ended up with an Apollo Campervan. Apparently several hire companies have merged. This be ame obvious as several different names invalid sizes of Campervans were parked in the same yard. Upon arrival we were told that the merger of the booking system was happening and the system had crashed. This is on a Monday tourists arriving over the weekend so five couples were waiting in line. After 2 hrs we've got abandoned but the sidewindow was broken!?? Why wasn't that picked up(and fixed) upon return?? So another 1.5hrs later we finally drove off. The manger at the place dwyer es credit as she kept us posted and tried her best in 'challenging' circumstances. But all got worse. Getting ready to sleep we realised that the base of the pull-out bed had a massive 'lip' right in the middle. The 5cm matrass could not compensate. A totally stupid design! Fortunately we've brought a tent and slept in there. Upon return nobody was really interested in my feedback. A subsequent complaint offered a $60.00 compensation. Ridiculous!! I am almost certain that the company would have received complaints previously however they still rent out this van despite. Btw the instruction video made no mention of this. Beware of Apollo! At least do check out how to make you bed and sleep in comfort .. ,dudkdukman,Darwin,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hi everyone!    Will driving in Tasmania be challenging in August? Do we need snowchain? We will arrive in Hobart plan to visit MONA Freycinet Craddle Mountain and leave from Launceston all in 5-6 days. Will it be doable?    Also due to inexplicable inconsistency in government offices back in my home country the name in my local driving license doesn't include my last name while my international driving license and passport has my full name will I get any problem with the car rental?    Any tips on flying in/out Tasmania and the most value-for-money car rental company will also be appreciated. ,StElle,Tasmania,"Jakarta, Indonesia"
Later this week we are planning to drive (2wd) to Litchfield and then from Wangi Falls to Berry Springs. Is the drive from Wangi Falls to Berry Springs a sealed road and safe for 2wd?  If we don't stop at Berry Springs and drive back to Darwin from Wangi Falls it will be a sealed road (highway I assume) safe for 2 wd?  Apologies for the ignorant questions as its our first time in NT and not sure what is allowed or not allowed. ,travelfan_fromAsia,Darwin,singapore
I have an early morning flight Domestic on VA. Looking at Google Maps it is a little difficult to see where VA departures are. But I think I remember it is close to the Domestic Airport train station. If that is the case it appears the Ibis is my best bet price to be within walking distance of departures. Am I seeing this correctly?    Thanks ,GAFoodie,Brisbane Region,"Atlanta, GA"
Apologies for the long trip report which I will post as replies to this post. I have just spent 13 days travelling anti-clockwise around Tasmania starting and finishing in Hobart. I spent the first two nights and my last night in Hobart. My first two nights I stayed at the Custom House Hotel by Brooke Street Pier. The hotel stay included an excellent breakfast and I also had dinner there on one night which was very good - the seafood chowder. I have posted reviews of all my accommodation and also the tours that I did if you search by my profile. Thanks to all the people who contributed to my initial request for information and also to everyone on the forum who has posted helpful information on other threads.    While in Hobart I did the Red Decker hop-on/hop-off bus tour which was a good way to see the city but most importantly for me meant I got to the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens which a friend had recommended. Although it was winter in Tasmania the gardens were very interesting and there was a great cafe in the centre. The bus tour starts later and ends earlier in the winter and a number of the attractions (Cascade Female Factory site) were closed to visitors so there was not much point hopping off the bus there.    Were I going to visit Hobart again I would definitely try to include a Saturday morning stay there to see the Salamanca market. And I missed the Mofo Festival by 2 days but the accommodation prices during the festival were significantly higher than beforehand. While in Hobart I had fish and chips from a stall by the harbour and they were great. ,Wales_Solo_traveller,Tasmania,"Penarth, United..."
I'm wanting to plan a small solo holiday of probably 3-4 nights in July/August and I'm getting stuck on where would be a good location. The aim is mostly to spend time just relaxing. I'm feeling exhausted and burned out and need a few days where I don't need to do much. If it was Summer I'd book anywhere nice with a pool or nearish a beach and just chill out in the sun with a drink but I don't know what's going to be similarly relaxing in Winter. I tend to be someone that likes to cram a heap of sightseeing into their holidays so planning the opposite has been surprisingly hard.    I'm based in Melbourne and don't have a car. I'm not opposed to hiring a car but I'd prefer if places were walkable/public transportable. I've been considering possibly going to Queensland for the warmer weather but I'm open to other ideas.    Budget is a max of $1500 but under would be great. I'm happy with travelling carry on only and getting cheap Jetstar flights so I can spend more on nice accommodation. ,Heather I,,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hubby and I (60's) arriving late August for 6 nights staying at By the Sea.  We would like to spend some time at the beach as well as all the other activities we have planned but unsure if the stinger nets are in place all year round or just seasonally?  Also are they located in front of the Surf club or further away? Obviously we will still be careful but is is safe to swim in other parts along 4 mile beach?  Thanks. ,Shoesandhandbags,Port Douglas,"Christchurch, New..."

One person is arriving at International (T2?) and another arrives 2 hours later at T4. Both will then head in to the CBD.

Hi all can anyone tell me if I can use QANTAS TravelPass credits (given for a cancelled flight to New Caledonia in May 2020 due to COVID) can be used for JetStar bookings? I want to fly from Sydney to Fiji in May and the best flights for me are on JetStar and not QANTAS but I have $350 of credit on QANTAS which will run out on 31/07/22..    I have googled and looked on the QANTAS site and the FAQ and i honestly can't find the answer. Ringing or emailing them is utterly hopeless these days and I want to book ASAP so hoping someone knows!    (BTW given there are so many pages in this thread I don't have time to trawl through all of them so sorry if this has already been answered ,Mike C,,"Sydney, Australia"
Hi all    My husband and I are based in Sydney and hope to do our travelling to WA before we move back to the UK middle of next year.    We still work and don't expect to take breaks longer than 2 weeks at a time (also long trips are just too exhausting for me) and want to avoid having super long driving days because my poor husband is the only driver!    WA is massive and difficult to wrap my head around in terms of logistics so I would like to pick your brain on the best way to do this.    We are not into cities or night life or camping. Love hiking diving generally exploring nature and are photography enthusiasts. My thinking atm is as follows with the aim to focus on the most unique and beautiful areas of WA (don't particularly need to go to wine country etc):    - 5 days to 1 week in Jan/Feb: fly to Esperance area for beach time  - 2 weeks in April/May: fly to Exmouth for the coast and then Karijini  - 2 weeks in June: fly to Broome for the coast and then drive to Kununurra and then drive back to Broome (?) for flight back to Sydney    The part that is most confusing to me is the last trip since most itinerary continues to NT. So I would like to check if what I have in mind is at all sensible. We could probably consider flying from Exmouth to Broome since it may be better to combine these trips but it's a lot of travelling in one go for us!    Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks üòä ,seonmi,Western Australia,"London, United..."
I‚Äôve been looking into the various options for our November trip which is covered on my Melbourne / Adelaide query. I am now thinking of changing my GOR itinerary slightly to avoid changing hotels every night so I want to look at least one 2 night stay..    We are both in our early 70s and regularly do a 300 mile trip in the uk in a day so are ok spending 5-6 hours driving (with stops) as necessary. We are not into hiking as my partner has slight respiratory problems but like wandering round small towns (avoiding steep hills or steps) and stopping for coffee or a beer and something to eat. We also enjoy scenic drives on coastal/country roads (hairpin bends are not a problem).    The original plan was  Leave Melbourne  1 night Apollo Bay  1 night Port Fairy  1 night Robe  1 night Barossa.  Arrive Adelaide    I‚Äôm now thinking of how to space the overnight stops if we spend 2 x 2 nights on the GOR leaving from Melbourne after the family get together and wedding as even with a longer drive we would find it more relaxing. Barossa and the Grampians are off the agenda as we would prefer to stick to the GOR. We plan to spend 3 nights in Adelaide before returning back to the UK.  I am wondering whether 2 nights Port Campbell and 2 nights Robe would be good options.    Any advice would be appreciated including alternative suggestions for the stopovers as we realise that distance and time for sightseeing on route might make other options a better choice. ,UKTravelover,,"Bourne End, United..."
Hi all my mum and I are planning on taking a trip to Uluru in June 2023. We will be flying from Perth but there are no direct flights. Our options are basically:    1. Fly Perth to Sydney or Melbourne then fly direct from Sydney/Melbourne to Yulara; or  2. Fly Perth to Alice Springs (via probably via Adelaide) then pick up hire car and drive from Alice Springs to Yulara.    The second option would probably mean spending at least one night in Alice Springs. It sounds like an interesting town with some fascinating attractions (eg the Olive Pink Botanic Garden the Desert Park the Royal Flying Doctor museum etc). But from what I've read in the news lately I'm also aware the town has incredibly high crime rates and many places have closed. If we stay in Alice Springs we'd pick a reputable hotel and not venture out after dark. But I'm concerned that even daylight hours could be an issue.    So my question is is it worth doing a stopover in Alice Springs? Ie do the positive aspects of the attractions outweigh the potential crime/safety issues? If it is worth it should we stay one night or two? ,Suitcase_Sis81,Alice Springs,"Canberra, Australia"
