Hi everyone    With the regular questions and discussion on the Kruger National Park forums regarding the differences between privately owned game reserves and the government owned Kruger National Park I thought I would attempt to put into writing a detailed description of both broken down into subjects in the hope that it will provide a clearer understanding for future travellers making plans for a Kruger safari.    Sorry this post is rather long winded but it was necessary to cover so many aspects.    Actually attempting to compare the two experiences is really like comparing oranges and apples but I am hoping that the below information will assist with the understanding of the differences with 'public' and 'private'ad give an understanding of 'how things work'.    For full disclosure purposes I love both experiences very much and would go to both when budget allows. However like many regular visitors I do now prefer staying in the National Park there is nothing like getting up in the morning with no idea what thrills you will have that day and of course the fact that we can stay there for a whole month for the cost of a few nights [or even one!] in a private reserve. Regulars will understand my meaning but today I will do my best to simply present unbiased facts as I know them. I am simply a passionate traveler and am not linked to any properties in any way.    The titles are self explanatory. Privately run concessions usually consist of an area of land varying in size and with said land dedicated to that particular lodge although with many lodges you will find traversing of different properties by arrangement to increase game viewing possibilities as many land tracts are really not that big overall. Kruger National Park is government owned and managed with South African National Parks (SANParks) being the official managing body for both Kruger plus another twenty odd parks throughout South Africa.    The information comes from personal knowledge and experience staying in both types of reserves regularly and from people we have spoken to and learned from during our travels.    Input and questions are very welcome but please note that this is not a post about particular lodges and I respectfully request that no one uses this topic to talk about or recommend their 'favorites'. Although I have named names here and there the overall purpose is generic information only. Not reviews.    Under each topic I will advise what I know about private reserves then follow with the same for Kruger National Park. For KNP I only will reference staying inside the park at the Sanparks camps not perimeter towns nor will I cover day visitors.  Note there are private concessions within Kruger Park itself as well as the adjacent reserves but for the purpose of this exercise they would fall under private lodges category.    ACCOMMODATION >>>    Private Lodges:    Here I think I could comfortably say that pretty well any lodges in the private reserves will be more luxurious than the bungalows cottages etc in Kruger NP as they should be. Quite a few do offer more rustic surroundings but generally they offer a luxury stay albeit over varying levels and most are beautifully decorated in classic safari lodge style.    At top end lodges you may have a private heated pool chandeliers designer linen to sleep on yoga and massages fireplaces designer toiletries to bathe with and a private butler to ensure your every need is met. Even at the lower to mid range many lodges still offer considerable luxury and inclusions could be air conditioning shared butlers plunge pools private viewing decks gyms glass walled showers curio stores and often a full laundry service.    It is rare that in these privates lodge you need to bring along much most are 4 to 5* rated. Standard inclusions will be hairdryers toiletries swimming pools safes a mini bar maybe in tariff or not and tea and coffee making facilities. Some even have a 'pod' style coffee maker.    Rooms in some lodges may be adjacent within one large building or often are individual traditionally thatched chalets or 'khayas' which offer a more private and luxurious feel. Some are simply a bedroom and ensuite others more like a small apartment with multiple zones such as office and lounge areas. Many have outdoor showers and large furnished decks overlooking the bush at the top end you may have an outdoor spa or bathtub. Some offer adjoining and family suites others are much more intimate and geared to couples.    Unlike regular holidays staying at these lodges means you follow a particular routine consisting of morning and evening game drives with downtime in between. This time can span a few hours in the middle of the day between breakfast and lunch and again from lunch till the departure of the evening drive. This is where those lovely rooms really come into their own as the time may be spent watching the wildlife from your deck having a read napping in bed swimming in the pool or just lounging around soaking up the atmosphere.    Some offer activities for guests to partake in during downtime either included or at extra cost. These could be at the lodge such as aforementioned massages or spa treatments or involve visiting outside the reserve such as a local village or school or animal sanctuary even helicopter and hot air balloon rides.    Tent or tree house style of accommodation is also available some run off solar power and generators with limited power supply during certain hours and meals taken by candlelight adding to the bush ambience. Some are quite big lodges with 50+ guests others are more intimate with just 12. Most are unfenced and require you to be escorted to and from your room after dark. There are a couple of self catering lodges but very unusual.    Child policies vary considerably. Many do not allow children at all for reasons of safety being the natural inherent dangers of the bush including malaria risk and also for consideration of other guests comfort and game experience. Others both allow and encourage all ages with kiddy style clubs and babysitting and adjoining and family suites.    Kruger:    Within the 2 million hectares of Kruger National Park you will find plenty of accommodation options with a dozen main 'camps' plus also bush veld camps and bush lodges overnight hides and hikes and camping and tented 'satellite' camps. As a whole Kruger offer a more adventurous and do it yourself style safari.    In main camps choices range from camping sites and permanent safari tents through to huts and bungalows with or without kitchens guest cottages and at the top level the multi bathroomed and bedroomed guesthouses. Within each category are more choices e.g. tents and bungalows can come fully equipped or to save costs you can opt for a communal kitchen or bathroom. We like a kitchen because even if we plan to spend the day out we may prepare food to take but communal kitchens are very popular and like the laundries a nice spot to meet others and have a chat.    Units are serviced and cleaned daily as are communal ablution and kitchen facilities. Most units have air conditioning and utensils this is all indicated when you book. Personal items like toiletries and hairdryers not supplied.    Some units are in prime locations on the perimeter fence for great game viewing some are located on clifftops for spectacular views. Big guest houses are fabulous for groups and families with lounge areas full kitchens bars and TVs and often are set in prime position some even with private waterholes.    Main camps have well stocked shops petrol stations and restaurants. Facilities vary but there are swimming pools laundromats libraries and museums one camp even has a big outdoor screen showing wildlife films nightly.    Then there are bushveld camps and bush lodges [for groups] even overnight hides for the more adventurous. These camps do not have restaurants or shops therefore are fully self catering. Very popular particularly with locals and return visitors because of their wonderful private and bush ambience they need to be booked well in advance and some cottages here can be bigger and more luxurious than the regular bungalows.    MEALS >>>    Private:    Private lodges usually include all three main meals plus snacks. Snacks means nibbles with drinks while out on your evening game drive and traditional biscuits or rusks with your coffee on the morning drive. On top of this could be coffee and snacks before the morning drive high tea before the afternoon drive even food in the room as well.    Usually breakfast is served on returning from the morning drive dinner after the evening drive. Food quality should be of a high standard although different lodges may provide varying meal offerings for example some do a later brunch then high tea before the drive meaning two main meals per day although three is the norm. We have certainly never gone hungry at a private lodge! Special food requirements can usually be catered but do notify in advance.    There are also various systems with meal locations and rangers. Some lodges may serve dinner in a different location each night. E.g. in the Boma on the lawn in a lounge or restaurant area on the river bank and of course in your own room. [A boma is a type of traditional sheltering reed enclosure and in this context is associated with an open air barbeque with guests seated around a flickering fire and glowing lanterns]. Boma dinners are usually a buffet style where everyone eats together including the rangers and often make for a fun and rather rowdy night some lodges even have all dinners in the boma. You may also get a chance to taste the very species that you could have seen on an earlier drive such as kudu warthog or ostrich.    Many also offer surprise or romantic unexpected treats. One memorable dinner was when we stopped in the bush on the way back from the evening drive. Suddenly we were in the middle of a beautiful lantern lit area under the trees with candlelit tables set and a fabulous braai dinner awaiting us. It was wonderful and we were joined by all the lodge staff although I could not help keeping one eye on my surroundings that night. At some lodges the ranger eats with his guests every night although this is more uncommon some always sit the guests together others change it up with guests eating alone sometimes. Usually you eat with the same group that you are with on your game drives this means you get to meet lots of interesting people from all over the world admittedly we have had it backfire once or twice but that’s unusual.    Kruger:    When it comes to eating you can really do whatever you feel like no set times here so a day may go like this. For those who like to head out of the gate early mornings at opening time [like us] generally we take a thermos and mugs of [Amaroula] coffee in the car plus some traditional rusks to nibble on remembering this can be as early as 4.30a.m. The first coffee is finished while chatting at the gate and the next will be had late morning either driving around or stopped somewhere maybe at a sighting or picnic spot. For main breakfast you can prepare it yourself as the locals do on one of the gas skottels provided at the picnic spots or you may have a simple bowl of cereal or you may buy a meal at one of the camps or picnic spots to enjoy while soaking up the outlook. I love to see the feasts that some cook up on the skottels yum! We enjoy a stop at Afsaal picnic spot for a hearty cooked breakfast or lunch when in the south but of course you can do this at any of the camp restaurants at any time during the day it just depends where you are when you get hungry! It's really fun enjoying breakfast at different camps and other spots when out on drives some plan ahead some play it by ear. Depending on how you are going you may have a light breakfast and perhaps a main meal around lunch time or later made yourself back at camp or at a restaurant. Some come back to camp to get their lunch and have a rest or a nap others stay out all day and only have dinner at 'home'. Dinner might be quite light if you have already had a main meal or it might be a night out at the camp restaurant or follow tradition with the locals and fire up the braai and cook up your own feast. It is a great atmosphere in the camps at night under the stars surrounded by the gentle glowing of the coals and the yummy smells of braais cooking.    Virtually all the accommodations by the way have individual braai stands at each unit after all eating in the park is a very sociable experience. We have never had a visit where we have not met lots of friendly locals often ending up having a meal or drinks together it's all part of the experience. South Africans love to share information and chat about sightings and are very proud of their wonderful park and rightly so.    Personally our trips usually involve a mix of self catering and meals in restaurants and now maybe even more meals out with the recent improvements made to some of the eating places.    GAME VIEWING >>>    Once again massive differences here. I will generalize as best I can but my knowledge is based on experiences in the two reserves I am most familiar with Timbavati and Sabi Sand.    Private:    Game viewing is included in the price and conducted in large open 4 x 4 safari vehicles seating up to eleven including the guide plus a tracker out on the front trackers seat. Drives are done twice daily and lots of lodges also include a morning bush walk. This is an opportunity that should be taken generally done in one of two ways. It can be separate to the drive e.g. you head out after breakfast or it can be taken from the vehicle while out on the drive. Personally I love the bushwalks but would not choose a lodge that replaces the morning drive with a walk simply because of the need to maximize all viewing opportunities including ones not near the lodge. Some great sightings are often seen very early before the day heats up and I cannot imagine passing that morning drive experience up.    Number of people in a vehicle: There are three rows of seats plus one single next to the driver therefore maximum guests together is ten. The normal number varies from only six upwards a few lodges do offer a definite six max and many more do their best to keep it to six but it depends how full the lodge is at the time. We have seen jeeps out there with just one or two couples in the back and we have also seen them loaded up to nine or the max of ten. Peoples preferences vary on this some have no issues with how many are sharing the seat others [including ourselves full disclosure] will only stay where there are two per seat guaranteed. Various reasons mainly comfort but also to just have the opportunity to move around as much as we want with full vision out both sides of the jeep. Other reasons are to be able to throw all your stuff such as coats camera gear etc into the middle and of course very importantly for ease of taking photographs without attempting to lean over someone else or have someone lean over you. Some of the lodges that offer six max have boxes fitted in the middle of the seats which are fantastic for lenses jackets etc. So all this is just personal preference and may or may not be a factor in lodge choice but it needs to be said as generally it is not something first timers are aware of. There is only one lodge I know of that offers a maximum of four per vehicle and there also some that offer private vehicles for an extra cost of course but many take advantage of this particularly keen photographers.    Big 5: One sometimes touchy subject is [mostly for some of us regulars] the term Big 5 an old hunting phrase that has turned into a somewhat overused marketing tool after all I really don’t know many people that have buffalo at the top of their wish list. A quick scan of most lodge websites and you will soon see they offer big 5 viewing which is all well and good but a shame IMHO that there are so many other wonderful animals that deserve just as much attention and will provide just as thrilling sightings. For example hippo giraffe hyeana African wild dog cheetah zebra and so many more. Fortunately a good ranger will have an appreciation for all and will try to show as much variety as he can but remember he is also at the whim of guests desires and big 5 are what many especially first timers want to tick of their list. However IMHO the guests who have the best time are the ones who are interested in the all of the myriad species to be found in the bush. Luckily a good ranger will chat to his or her guests about what they would like to see and will do his best to ensure they leave satisfied.  The really sad part is that Big 5 are still hunted in the area so I guess the term will live on.    To add to that remember if you go to a private reserve such as Sabi Sand or Timbavati you will see plenty of wildlife but you are not in Kruger Park itself rather you are in what is known as Greater Kruger National Park which is the title that includes the adjacent reserves and private concessions within Kruger. Looking on a map will show that Kruger itself is massive and therefore home to an incredible quantity and variety of wildlife the private reserves being a tiny part of the park therefore the animals you see will also be only a tiny portion of the total widlife so do not expect the wide open plains with large animals herds that you may have an image of these private reserves are only large enough to take so many animals although there are some wonderful big buffalo and elephant herds around. There is nothing wrong with that but many people do not realize this before they go and may have different expectations we have met plenty like this. What you do get however can be spectacular close up and intimate viewing of big cats and more and of course the Sabi Sand reserve rightly so has the reputation of the best leopard viewing in the world and has certainly never let us down.    Traversing: Number of vehicles at a sighting is restricted to two or three in the interests of animal welfare but in an area that has lots of vehicles traversing you sometimes have to move off after a few minutes to allow another vehicle in. This is known as a queueing system operated by lodges who work in syndicates which allow traversing rights on each others properties and it should be well managed by the various head rangers. Using Sabi Sand area as an example in a huge reserve like Mala Mala [technically not part of Sabi Sand] there are no other vehicles traversing because they have such massive tracts of land and have ample game viewing on their own property especially as they have a massive border with Kruger. Others in the south and middle zones are similar and may only traverse with one other lodge giving guests a fairly exclusive experience. In the western and northern sectors you will find quite a few lodges all traversing each others land therefore giving guests a massive viewing area as a map will show each individual lodges land area is really quite small on its own. Rangers from different lodges will radio each other about sightings and even help each other out with seeking particular animals. We have never had a problem ourselves with this in fact the sharing of sightings usually means much better experiences for guests. Sometimes it can be better than others I do remember a time once when an amazing wild dog sighting was so popular that we barely got a couple of minutes with them another time in a non traversing lodge we spent an hour and a half at one spectacular sighting so you see lots will depend on where you are and when. The trade off for maximum sharing of sightings can be less time spent at same.    If you are choosing from several lodges that all traverse the same area one of the factors influencing me would be location I would tend to choose a more central lodge that does not have as far to travel in each direction there are occasions when it may be just too far to head from north all the way south and so on it does happen. Also be aware some reserves have large tracts of land that are held by private owners or used by other 'tourists'.    Many lodges also advertise that with no fences along the Kruger border animals wander in and out of the reserve. While this can be somewhat true IMO this is not something to rely on to enable better game viewing. Most animals are territorial to varying degrees and do not just wander backwards and forwards across borders each day especially the big cats that people want to see and what they do not say is that it is just as easy for the animals to wander back into Kruger I have seen it happen and as you will see on the map it can be quite some distance to travel. When the fences were dropped some wildlife did move back into Kruger for its space but intense management of private reserves has allowed growth and establishment of some of the iconic species most valued when it come to the tourism dollar with leopard viewing a prime example. Another example is a famous lion pride that has just recently moved out and into Kruger and up to the Manyeleti reserve so yes it does work both ways. Other animals tend to go where they can 'fit' one of the reason cheetah are so few and far between in Sabi Sand is because of the dense leopard population although a couple have fortunately recently re established in the area which is wonderful.    The rangers that take the guests out on these drives can and will definitely have an effect on your experience. There are many stories about rangers and trackers we personally have always had incredible rangers with an astonishing knowledge of the bush and creatures and a passion to match. This is really what you should expect especially paying big $ a fully competent experienced and trained ranger and tracker team that will not only be able to share their knowledge but have a high level of people skills. They will be after all completely responsible for your safety and safari experience and fortunately I think most meet these requirements.    One more aspect of private reserves is the advertised ability to go off road. Again this can be a bit of a controversial issue especially with bush 'purists' and many others who do not believe that these massive vehicles should be allowed to drive into the bush at all destroying habitat and possibly many small creatures along the way and a couple of my experiences have me somewhat agreeing. Anyway it is a feature of the reserves it is private land and so they are allowed. Sometimes they will state for 'special' or 'big 5' sightings and this is usually the case but it needs to be made clear here the trucks do not just rampage around the bush looking for wildlife in fact there are tracks and roads everywhere and these are where you will drive only going off road if a special sighting has been radioed in or your tracker has found tracks leading to something special. Even then extreme care must be taken it would not only be unethical to do otherwise but the untold damage to the bush and its inhabitants would be shocking. And really many of the animals are actually found on or close to the tracks anyway after all they use them too!    Expect amazing close up experiences unlike anywhere else.    Kruger:    In Kruger you will find a completely different type of vehicle doing game drives normal cars! People drive around the park on their own steam having a wonderful time searching for wildlife and soaking up the atmosphere or coming across other cars indicating there is something to be seen or enjoying the unequalled thrill of your own discovery.    Unlike in private reserves which for the most part IMO cater for overseas guests drives in KNP are done by both foreign and local visitors in either their own or a hired vehicle. You will see everything from small sedans SUVs and utility vehicles up to large 4 x4s. Other types of vehicles will be seen too like vans and occasionally small buses plus of course the ubiquitous 'safari jeeps' private game drive vehicles operated by tour companies. These come into the park on a daily basis from outside locations offering clients various options such as full day or half day drives. Some are custom safari trucks others are modified utility vehicles with the seats and covers built up on to the back. Comfort levels seem to vary considerably and do remember this if you are planning a full day drive as most are open sided and high up so the wind factor can be quite considerable. These are ideal for those who do not feel comfortable driving themselves around or who would like to have a guide and also with solo travelers who would like to join a group to see the park so can be great option for many. Because of time limits and sometimes high expectations by guests thanks to marketing they are mostly seen in the south of the park. I won't put further detail here as this post is more self drive related and my opinions may be too subjective.    Because of Kruger being ideal for self drive you can simply drive wherever you want whenever you want. I have touched on meals above and the same goes for game driving. Many like us head out at gate opening times not returning until gate closing time which could be up to a rather long fourteen hours a day not what everyone does but the thing is you can choose to do so if you want to. Many return to camp during the day maybe after a morning drive and have a meal a nap a swim do a bit of shopping or just relax and enjoy the location similar to the private lodge routine. I always suggest to stop wherever you can when out driving as you never know when you could be held up on the way back to camp or just simply spend a lot of time at a good sighting. Toilets are found in picnic spots and camps and you can also stretch your legs at various viewpoints hides and some bridges that allow you to alight.    You do not go off road and just as well there would be no animals or bush left if that were to happen the land would simply be decimated. There are thousands of kilometers of roads and tracks to drive without doing this anyway and there is ample wildlife viewing from roads hides and viewpoints. Remember there are hundreds of thousands of creatures here and there is not the need to go off road unlike private reserves where numbers are lower. And just like in reserves wildlife also use the roads and tracks sometimes providing spectacular sightings.    Often when talking about Kruger people will say it is more crowded and parts certainly can be but also unfortunately people will often emphasise maybe a crowded sighting they saw while forgetting about all the hundreds of quiet sightings that are going on at the same time! With all those roads to drive there is no need at all to hang around at a crowded sighting or for that matter even drive the busier roads all the time. It is no secret that the most popular therefore busy areas of the park are in the south particularly in the famed area from Skukuza to Lower Sabie both big camps and the reason is simple this is a very game dense area. In fact with Kruger boasting a population of over 1000 leopards and many being right here in the south along the river often one lounging in a tree will cause cars to park along the road for several days. Any regular will have a story of coming across a bunch of cars watching a leopard in a tree did not hang around and enjoyed another leopard down the road which they had all to themselves! But these instances are not indicative of the whole experience at all in fact I can probably count on less than one hand how many times we have been caught in a catjam and yet there are hundreds of other sightings we have had either to ourselves or just shared with minimal cars. You need to get onto the unmade roads as much as you can and really keep your eyes peeled and of course more importantly avoid the local holiday periods such as school holidays Christmas Easter etc. I do know it can be difficult when time is short and you want to maximize your chances.    The central areas of Kruger are also very wildlife dense for example the areas around Satara Talamati and north to Olifants. For those wanting to maximize big 5 game viewing often this is about as far north as they will go if that far. Then when they return once again as so many do they will do as the locals and regulars do and venture northwards into the less populated areas for example Mopani and Shingwedzi as well as giving the bushveld camps a try. There is still plenty to see in the north.    At nearly 20000 kilometers in size and home to some 200000 mammals and an amazing variety of birds and reptiles there is plenty for everyone to see without being in crowds. We always include a long stay in the south as possible and some of our most spectacular sightings have been on drives taken from Skukuza the biggest camp of all.    Another option for visitors to the park is guided bush walks taken with an armed ranger an experience not to be missed if you have the time. There are also guided sunset night and morning game drives in open game trucks that leave from camps and some gates usually getting you into the park when camp gates are closed to others. Bush Braais are another great experience where a game drive includes a stop out in the bush for dinner and then another game drive on the return journey also to be booked at camp.    PRICE >>>    Private:    The pricing for these lodges is pretty hefty as you would expect with rates for a couple from around the $4/$500 per night mark right up to over $3000 per night. You may pick up something cheaper as there are regular specials offered maybe a winter special or an offer to stay for four nights paying for three honeymooners special etc. Like any hotel or resort the levels of luxury and inclusions offered are generally related to the price however in some reserves paying the biggest $ does not always guarantee the best game viewing experience.    Kruger :    In Kruger the price range for different accommodation is quite large but here is a bit of a guide to what you can expect price wise [not including camping]……    Permanent safari tent for 2pax from around R480 with fridge huts start at R280 for 1pax and R445 for 2pax and bungalows start around R880 for 2pax. The large guesthouses cost around R3400 for 4pax. As you can see all very reasonable considering the location.    Of course international guests will have car expenses on top of this. Meals can be as cheap as you like if you self cater for us that’s a lot cheaper than at home.    Also allow for daily conservation fees which can be reduced by purchase of a 'Wildcard' for longer stays though fees apply to private reserves also. These fees are vital for conservation of the parks species particularly with the ongoing and expensive war against poachers.      In summary you should have a wonderful experience whatever you choose after all Kruger is South Africa's flagship and most famous park.    I have said this before on the forums I do like people to be aware of the options that they have when planning a safari. In private lodges I have met people who have no idea they are not actually in the main part of Kruger Park and I have met people who never thought they would be able to return again because of what those few days cost them. Others of course would not have it any other way and are happy to spend big $ to be able have the experience of being taken out on drives while staying in a luxury all inclusive lodge.    Many of those who only stay within Kruger Park camps also would not have it any other way and cannot understand the point of spending all that money in a private lodge so how lucky we are to have such a tough choice!    So both ways have their pros and cons and their fans but let's at least have people make informed choices rather than what is only shown in the glossy brochures. Even more concerning is that so many people do not experience Africa at all despite wanting to go it's on so many bucket lists because they do not realise that there are budget friendly options that do not involve tents and overland trucks!    If you need luxuries that are mentioned at the top of this post then a private reserve may suit best especially if you only have a very short time. The animals here are very habituated to vehicles allowing incredible close up and sometimes spectacular viewing e.g. as soon as cubs are presented to the outside world by Mum they will have large game vehicles passing by or sitting close. A photographers dream. Ranger conduct is excellent and nothing should be done to disturb animals in anyway but yes as they are used to game vehicles and sometimes but not always they can be easily 'found'  some people like this and some not so much. Also consider many experiences at these lodges will be fairly similar so a read of the reviews right here on this site will give you a really good idea exactly what to expect.    In Kruger of course the biggest thrills most often from what you discover yourself whether you come across a pride of lions or pack of wild dogs down a dirt track or spy an amazing eagle on a branch above or my favorite finding an animal for the first time that you have not seen before because it is rare. Many with time restrictions do Kruger itself in a day and see lots but the longer you stay the more justice you will give the park. We have had equally awesome experiences in both places but we do like that we can spend a lot longer at a good sighting in the park of course.    In fact to me this is one of the primary and most important differences between the two types of reserves. While wherever I am I will be equally excited when I get up in the morning to head out on a game drive in a private lodge I will mostly have a fairly good idea what my drive will be like and what I can expect to see and this can be very much also affected by the other guests driving with you. Having said that however of course this is not the same feeling for someone on their very first safari.    In Kruger Park when I get up in the morning I have absolutely no idea what the day will bring and what amazing experiences I will have and that is exactly the feeling of anticipation that draws so many people back over and over again…    Enjoy!

Hello everyone    Following on from my previous Kruger comparison post and due to the popularity of Kruger National Park I think it is appropriate to provide some extra information to assist those enquiring about and planning to book a visit as it is a do it yourself style of booking and despite being straightforward may be a little confusing for first timers.    Some of this information should assist day visitors but is primarily for those who plan to drive themselves and stay right inside in the National Park camps and not for the adjacent or inside private concessions which unlike the government run KNP are booked direct. In the spirit of what these forums are all about all questions tips and comments are very much welcome however references to businesses and self serving posts are not 😊.    Kruger is the flagship of the South African parks and in my opinion probably the easiest accessed most budget friendly safari option with the widest variety of wildlife you will find anywhere. The park itself contains hundreds of thousands of creatures made up of over seven hundred species of birds mammals and reptiles as well as containing archaeological historic and cultural treasures.    Located in a summer rainfall area the park can be very hot and humid at this time and daytime temperatures from October to March can range from mid twenties up to into the forties nights in winter can drop to single figures but daytime temperatures are mostly perfect sunny and low to mid twenties. This makes the park suitable to visit all year round with varying temperatures throughout due its vast size and number of eco systems.      Getting there..    Road access is quite easy from Johannesburg via well signposted good quality highways and well located entry gates where on arrival identification overnight bookings or pre purchased wild cards are to be shown forms filled in and vehicles checked. A rules and regulations brochure will be handed out which must be read and from then on carried in the glove box at all times.  Some international guests like to fly in to nearby airports just outside the park or into Skukuza Airport right inside picking up a hire car on arrival or otherwise may simply collect the car from Johannesburg Airport and drive out directly.    This decision is purely one of personal choice. We do it both ways but really do prefer to drive out we arrive earlier it’s easier to pick up supplies cheaper and there are no luggage/security/airport hassles or waiting around for flights. This however does work in well with our international flights times so may not suit everyone. Be aware also that luggage is more restricted on these short flights.    Most visitors stock up on supplies on the way into the park at one of large regional supermarkets in towns close to the gates. You can also pick up a surprisingly large variety of foods at the camp stores which also serve as a great back up for anything which is forgotten. One essential item to mention is the cooler box which is needed both out on drives during the day plus moving between camps.    Camps and game driving..    First up and importantly the park is huge the size of many small countries at nearly twenty thousand sq kilometers and provides a more enjoyable experience if not rushed slow driving always produces more. Roads throughout the park are both tar and gravel and can be driven with any type of vehicle no four wheel drive is needed despite the number of them in the park although higher wheelbase vehicles like SUVs are extremely popular. Activities abound and include museums hikes bushwalks overnight trails and much more even an unfenced golf course for the adventurous.    Two questions I often see asked are ‘’do I need a guide’’ or ‘’ How will I know where the animals are?’’ Believe me this is not a problem game viewing is as simple as driving around slowly with eyes peeled watching out for wildlife in the bush in trees on the road and for other vehicles stopped to the side usually indicating a sighting. Big crowds will mean big cats! however despite impressions sometimes given this is very much far from always being the case. You may be surprised at the low portion of sightings you even find yourself! There are various ‘sighting apps’ and other such options for supposedly finding wildlife which personally I do not use or believe in because chances are animals will have moved on by time you get there poor reception may cause speeding roadkill and crowding and most of all because there is simply no thrill like that of finding your own sighting as you come over the crest of a hill or around a bend why would you want to know what is coming up!    This thrill is actually one of the things that keeps many coming back over and over simply not knowing what the day will bring or what you will see out there. Plus chances are while you are rushing to some reported sighting other opportunities will be likely missed.    Keep to speed limits when driving have your windows down keep within the vehicle enjoy the bush sights and sounds and always adhere to the gate times. Alighting vehicles is not allowed apart from designated spots so always take a leg stretch/bathroom break when possible. This means at picnic spots viewpoints some high bridges and of course the camps where you can also grab a bite to eat or stock up on supplies. No alighting allowed at dams and waterholes for obvious reasons. Always carry snacks and drinks in the car as you never know what hold ups or road blocks you may encounter. Some even carry ‘potties’!    It is often said that the best sightings are usually very early in the mornings before the heat of the day and again at sunset as the sun is going down. While I do agree with this and certainly these golden hours are better for photography and I am nearly always out of the gate at opening time I would not forgo daytime driving for this reason if it is what you want to do except in extreme heat when many animals really do go into hiding. We have had wonderful sightings during the day of just about everything and the more you are out the more you will see. A favorite sighting regularly seen in the midday sun is that of elephants bathing swimming and drinking in dams rivers and waterholes. Massive Nile crocodiles also often spend hot days basking in the sun around dams and if you are really lucky the enjoyment that comes from watching hyenas or baboons swimming is just unbelievable.    Nearly forty different camps and lodges are on offer throughout the park in all price ranges from basic to luxury linen supplied and cleaned and serviced daily. Within the camps are camp sites tents huts cottages and bungalows and more even big guesthouses for groups and families amenities range from full kitchens and bathrooms to communal facilities. There are twelve main camps all have petrol stations and shops and most but not all have restaurants. The bush camps and lodges and satellite camps do not have these facilities and are geared for self caterers. These are more remote in more natural settings on unmade roads and provide a true bush experience whereas bigger camps can be quite busy especially at peak times of the day although accommodations are usually at some distance from the main areas and are only accessed by staying guests. There are then sites just for camping exclusive use bush lodges a couple of overnight hides and luxury lodges located in their own concessions. Disabled accommodation is also provided by Sanparks.    Daily conservation fees apply which I consider very fair compared with many other game parks across the continent. A loyalty card program known as WILD Card offers great savings if visiting for longer periods and/or using multiple parks. Members do not pay a daily fee instead one single purchase giving a year of entry to up to 80+ parks. Usually this is worthwhile purchasing for a stay of around six days or more.    Many accommodations are air conditioned but when making a booking ensure you check on the Sanparks site exactly what is provided at each unit…  https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/tourism/accommodation.php    Making bookings..    The two most popular booking methods are by telephone or in real time online here is my guide and some general information.    So once you have decided to take the plunge and enjoy this truly wonderful park and have researched your options on the official South African National Parks website with its excellent information including descriptions and photos of the accommodations and camps now it is time to decide on where to stay and for how long…    https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/    First up check the availability of places you like the look of ideally you need to do this very early as popular camps and spots book up well ahead. Bookings open eleven months in advance although this can vary and attempts are currently being made to increase and standardise this period.    Next on the Sanparks site you need to register this is quite straight forward and simply involves setting up a profile including personal details passport number etc and results in an account type set up which you will always have and be able to log in and access at any time to see the booking or make a payment. Later on dates and types of accommodations can be easily changed particular when you cannot get your first choice on the initial booking. Availability changes on a daily basis when people don’t pay their deposit their booking is forfeited and most have made amendments once a preferable choice of accommodation comes up    Personally when booking I always like to use the telephone and talk directly to the Sanparks operators any language difficulties are quickly eased by the fact that you have already registered as they will access your profile and have all your personal details right in front of them meaning you really need to only provide dates and camps. This should be the only time you need to call and I have always found the operators very friendly and helpful    By time you sit down and log back on to your account you will probably have your first confirmation email with general information then another will soon arrive with the booking details and a reference number. Deposit will be due in thirty days the balance sixty days before arriving. This is when it gets exciting as you can see all the planning coming together!    Alternatively you can do your booking all online in real time. I do not favor this method as you pay for your booking up front whereas by phone nothing is due immediately and changes afterwards are not quite as simple. The advantage is however that you get a five percent discount for paying in full. Again this is all just personal choice and preference.    From then on it is easy to make payments direct to your account. Soon after you will receive a confirmation email with a new statement and the account will be adjusted accordingly showing the new balance.    Current tariffs..  https://www.sanparks.org/docs/tourism_tariffs/tariffs-2017-2018.pdf?time=1516350974    I will now offer a few personal thoughts on some camps again just my opinions. mainly main camps at this stage as they are often the most popular for first timers and if I go onto details on every single camp I will need to write a book!!    Southern region >    Skukuza is the administration headquarters and also the biggest camp so is always busy and bustling with staff and public alike. Often called a mini city where getting from a bungalow at one end to a restaurant at the other can entail a car drive. Normally busyness is not something that affects staying guests as accommodations are well away from the main shopping and eating areas and are usually quiet. However I must say I now tend to avoid stopping here from other camps at mid morning and lunch times as safari jeeps arrive around then and parking and access can be a huge issue just plan to get there a bit later or earlier if possible. Cattle Baron the best restaurant in the park imho is also here and is famous for its steaks and the only place where I have had nothing but exceptional meals. To sit inside at night I would suggest a booking you cannot book the outside deck with views.    Lower Sabie right on the magnificent Sabie River is the other large southern camp and is also always very busy due to being in the heart of prime viewing areas at a point in a triangle which is generally considered one of the most densely populated leopard areas anywhere. Pretoriaskop Krugers oldest camp and Crocodile Bridge are close to the perimeter and are both fine choices being lovely and peaceful. Croc Bridge is right at the gate and does have has civilization in viewing distance which bothers some I don’t really care for a few days as am compensated by watching the elephants crossing the river and the local game viewing roads. It’s only a short distance up to Lower Sabie but has a very different ambience. Berg en Dal is quite unique in location and feel a different style to many camps but really nice good restaurant and is close to Malelane Gate.    Central region >    Here you will find Satara huge and very popular famous for its easy access to many well known and wonderful game viewing roads where wildlife of all kinds is plentiful thanks to the combination of heavy bushveld and open savannah that is not found everywhere in Kruger. Orpen is another main camp here also on the perimeter near Orpen gate. Camp is small and beautifully set up with all units overlooking the waterhole and no restaurant. Both camps are known for their much talked about webcams.    Heading north are Olifants and Letaba. The former is famous for its breathtaking cliff top location overlooking magnificent Olifants River. Here the rooms with river views are easily the most popular and book up the fastest and the two cliff top guest houses are simply spectacular. This camp is a wonderful place to just relax and enjoy I love watching the eagles soaring right at eye level and the wildlife below. Letaba is known for its peaceful ambience sitting in an idyllic spot located right on a sandy bend of the Letaba river and the Elephant Museum located here is always worth a stop.    Northern region >    Further along are the camps Mopani Shingwedzi and Punda Maria this area is affectionately known as the ‘quieter north’. Game may not be as dense but is still there and sightings are shared with few. All three are quite different and have their own uniqueness Punda especially with its private feel and hilly locale beautiful botanical surroundings summer birding fever trees and of course the incredible baobabs. It is the northern most main camp. Shingwedzi Camp is quite large with differering styles of accommodations to some and to me is all about elephants including some of the biggest tuskers in the park. We seem to see them everywhere especially south down the Kanniedood Dam road late afternoon when great care must be taken driving. Accommodation here has views across the plains but for a real treat stay in the guesthouse where you can sit in your private yard right on the rivers edge with game wandering the river bed just a few meters away.    Mopani I really like up on a hill with a quite different look no tents or camping here just many large stone cottages and rondavels spread over a maze of streets running throughout the bushy grounds which have been purposely left this way rather than the usual water sucking grassy lawns and gardens. It is located right above the Pioneer Dam and has a wonderful Baobab tree right inside camp.    The abovementioned camps as I said are just a small selection there are plenty more options just too many to go into every detail here.  The link to all camps….    https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/camps/    Bush camps I will add are every bit as popular for those who will be self catering due to the remoteness and exclusive feel often located down private and quite long unmade roads really adding to the experience. The private Biyamiti road is probably the most well known for sightings but all locations are excellent my favorite is probably Talamati due to the camp waterhole which can be spectacular in dry times.    Another point is that just because your camp may not have a restaurant does not mean you cannot still visit those at other camps while out driving. Heading out early am could mean you stop at a different camp for breakfast or maybe on the way home later. For example when staying at Crocodile Bridge we often stop at Lower Sabie for a main meal mid afternoon and then just need a snack later back home.    There is so much more to know about Kruger than just the tiny portion I have touched on above and I could go on but best I stop here to avoid overload! As said at the start questions are welcome but I hope this provides a bit of help and a starting point for new visitors.    Enjoy ,thesandmans,,Gold Coast...

Hi! I'm thinking of doing a trip to South Africa (and Botswana) and it looks like April might be the only time I can go. I know that wildlife viewing is much better from June onward but curious if April is at least still worth it? Would i expect to see half as many animals? More? Less?    Thanks for any tips! ,ThisIsVlad,,
Myself and my wife are planning to fly into Johannesburg from the UK around mid August 2024. We plan to hire a 4 x 4 and travel to Kruger NP and then up to Victoria Falls/Chobe NP etc and then back to Jo'burg. We plan to do this in around 3 weeks and plan a further week on a beach somewhere in Mozabique (we will fly from Jo'burg).    Please can anyone provide any suggestions on routes and accommodation. Do we book a guided safari once at our accommodation? I have read we can do a self drive one but I think id prefer to do a guided one.    Also please can you advise the same for Vic Falls and Botswana ... I know its a big country and lots of miles I think it will take a few days of driving each way but with stops along the way to do safaris is what we would prefer.    Thanks in advance :) ,Yogi1968,Kruger National Park,"Sidmouth, United..."
Hi Kruger experts    I'm planning a self-drive safari in Kruger in September 2024 - yay! I will fly straight into Skukuza pick up my hire car and and drive to Satara for 2 nights. Therefore I won't have a chance to shop outside the park and will be relying on the rest camp stores in Skukuza and /or Satara.    I will then do the Olifants Wilderness Trail for 3 nights before driving from Letaba to Tamboti so will shop at either Letaba Olifants Satara or Orpen.    Q - any recommendations from these options?    Q - alternatively would you advise leaving the park via Orpen gate and shopping at a Superspar near there?    Q - I'm finding it hard to confirm exactly what they have in the rest camp stores so would appreciate it if someone could let me know which of the following would generally not be available:    - Yoghurt  - Cheese  - butter  - Muesli  - Eggs  - Bread  - Pizza bases pita bread or wraps  - Canned baked beans  - Canned tuna  - pre-cooked rice packets  - Pre-made vegetable kebabs / skewers  - Pre-made salads  - Vegetarian burger patties or vegetarian sausages  - Nuts  - Muesli bars  - Wine  - Alfoil  - Paper towels  - Esky / cooler box (small / medium)    Many thanks Emma ,EJ79WA,Kruger National Park,"Perth, Australia"
Hi. We are planning a trip for September 2024. We want to rent a car in JNB and self drive the park but do not want to stay at the lodging in the park - no offense to anyone that does it but the accommodations are not our style. All the luxury lodges include game drives but we would prefer to do them ourselves and they charge a lot extra $$$ to do them private.    With that said any suggestions on where we can stay that is still a mid-range accommodation / on the nicer end but does not include game drives so we can do the driving ourselves? I’m struggling to find information on this. Any advice or suggestions welcome :) ,Taylor L,Kruger National Park,

My partner and I have a few days in Cape Town next month (January 2024) prior to embarking on a cruise.    We are both seniors (73/68) from Australia: seasoned travellers. Mostly we like to explore where we visit by local public transport. I visited Cape Town in 1974 and appreciate the world has changed much since then.    I am also a lifetime public transport enthusiast.    Anyway; my specifc questions.    We propose to do the Table Mountain cableway (as I did in 1974). Is it safe to use public transport to the lower terminal?|    I also rode local trains to Simonstown and Stellenbosch in 1974. Is it feasible to try doing that again in 2024?    We are staying at Southern Sun Cullinan; what is the best transport option from the airport? Our flight arrives late afternoon.    Thanks in advance for any tips and assistance.

Hello everyone    I'm hoping a few people with experience using Federal air may be able to help me make a decision.    We'll be in Sabi Sands checking out of our lodge on June 1st and need to be in Nairobi on by evening on June2nd.    We're planning to take a Federal Air flight directly from the airstrip near our lodge in Sabi Sands to Johannesburg International airport which should get us to JNB at around 11:00am. We have a connecting flight out of JNB at 5pm that same day.    1. I assume 5-6 hours will be more than enough time to make this connection?  2. How reliable is Federal Air should I have any concerns about them being delayed or cancelling a flight?    Any thoughts/feedback is appreciated.    Thank you. ,Mocha1A,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,

Hello me and my wife are planning a trip from the UK to Johannesburg where we plan on hiring a 4 x 4 and driving to Kruger NP where we will spend 5 - 7 days and then heading up to Victoria Falls spend a few days there and then do Chobe NP etc and spend a few days heading back to Jo'burg and possibly end with a week/10 days in Mauritius.    What I really need some clarification on is the best time of year to travel to see wildlife. I have been told by someone who lives in SA that January is a good time although upon researching a little I am unsure. Would like some advice on this trip please and the best times to travel to see wildlife. I realise that January is the wet season but also summer in SA. I also know that there may be young animals plus migratory birds at this time of year. I am not really interested in birds but more interested in seeing the Big 5 and particularly Lions Giraffes Rhinos etc. Any help or advice welcomed. Thanks ,Yogi1968,,"Sidmouth, United..."

Hello Everyone! We are travelling to SA end Mar-Early April. We have about 14 days there.    We will be landing in JNB on a Sunday night. We plan to do a guided day trip followed by a 2-4 day Safari tour at Kruger. We saw some tours that pick us up from JNB. After that we hope to fly to Cape Town to spend the rest of our trip there.    In Cape Town these are the things we want to do:  - rent our own car so that we can do the scenic drives  - table mountain  - robben island  - boulder beach  - lion's head  - at least one vineyard    This is what we have so far. Hope you hear any tips or suggestions for the activities how to split our time etc. Thank you in advance! ,arunkm8692,,Singapore

Hi TripAdvisor members! I would love to get your invaluable opinions!    We (my wife my 16-year-old son and I) are planning our first visit to South Africa in August 2024. Our original plan was to spend 4 nights in Kruger and then 4 nights in Cape Town. However a Capetonian warned me that August can be cold windy and rainy. As I am from the UK I'm not looking for the same kind of weather in Southern Africa! LOL. We were also hoping to see some great whites but I've been informed that sightings have become very rare due to overfishing and increased Orca activity. So I have started researching Victoria Falls – another destination on our bucket list. Cape Town is of course said to be one of the prettiest places on earth and I would love to see penguins! Decisions decisions!    Here’s another conundrum. If we decide to go to Victoria Falls from Kruger the direct flights are all out of Mpumalanga International Airport which is about 4 hours away from some of the affordable lodges in the Limpopo area. The flights are around 11.30am making it almost impossible to reach the airport in the morning from the lodges I enquired about in the Limpopo area due to gate times etc. I was considering staying in the Limpopo part of Kruger as I would like to see the Blyde River Canyon - which also seems like another beautiful part of the world to visit. As such I would need to catch a flight from JNB which would mean doing a safari at Pilanesberg and staying in an affordable place like Bakubung Bush Lodge. I have been reading TripAdvisor reviews about that park and it seems pretty decent - but it's not Kruger right? :-)    What do you all think? Would you pick Victoria Falls over Cape Town in August? There are similar posts on this topic from 2008 so getting newer/updated opinions would be good. Thank you all in advance and I wish you all happy healthy and safe travels. ,Chevaan S,,"Wallington, United..."

Next year we are traveling to Kruger National Park. We are flying from the United States and will be entering South Africa at JNB on our way to SZK (on one ticket). For the international portion of our flight we prefer to have carry-on bags only. At JNB we have an overnight layover and will be staying at the City Lodge Hotel. For the SA Airlink flight on to SZK the next morning our carry-on bags will be heavier than the SAA allowed limit of 8kg for Hand & Cabin baggage. Will there be any issue with checking our bags at the SAA counter for only that portion of our itinerary or would the bags need to be checked through to the final destination at our first flight? Thank you! ,tripnmex,Johannesburg,"Tucson, Arizona"

We passed through Mthatha and on the way out were stopped by a man in a high-vis vest who told us the brigde ahead was closed as it had been damaged due to recent flooding. The car in front of us was an E-type Jaguar who was also diverted. We were suspicious especially when the diversion ended up at a petrol station where we had to obtain a permit to drive through the alternative road. You are taken to an ATM and they try to fleece your account.  On escaping the town others tried the same scam and we were stopped a third time to pay a road fee for those with a hire car.

Hello Husband and I will be arriving in Stellenbosch on a Friday at around 3 pm and leaving early morning on Sunday. We are staying in Asara. I needed a few suggestions:    1. Please give me a dinner place suggestion for Day 1 with sunset views.    2. Day 2: I was thinking we can go to a wine estate (Uva Mira?) explore grounds and have lunch at 12.30.    3. Day 2: Explore Friday/Saturday Farmers market after lunch then head to Delaire Graff to explore grounds and have dinner there at 6.30 pm. I wanted to have lunch there but I see it is fully booked online. Any chances lunch booking becomes available?    Two wine sessions will be enough for us in one day. We like our days to be relaxed. How does this sound? Should we add/change something.    Thanks in advance. ,nst4,Stellenbosch,"Dubai, United Arab..."
Hello we are a couple in our early 40's and plan to visit Cape Town in November.

Hi All    So we are at a crossroads where we are deciding to either move to fish hoek area blouberg area or move to Germany. I am a German so myself my wife and son can move without issue.    But Germany has its problems from furries in schools being encouraged now to gender theory and gender reassignment being encouraged in certain schools etc.    but it is safer and cooler so no joburg heat waves. but my wife runs a accounting firm here that doings well.    Is living in fish hoek or blouberg area safe can I walk my son to school which I currently do every morning its 1km. can anyone suggest a good pre school that is similar to little leaders franchises? meaning gentle disciplining approach learn through play etc. ,Sven,Cape Town,"Johannesburg, South..."
Hi All    I am planning a camily trip with my wife and two kids aged 9&10. My son is absolutely crazy about wildlife and I want this to be an amazing experience for the whole family.    We have never been to Africa before and hence seeking your advice.    Our priorities are:  1. Safety  2. Authentic experience  3. Cleanliness  4. Activities for kids - so it’s not purely watching animals we want them to have engaging activities  5. Peace and quiet  6. No long commutes (anything more than 1 hour)    How many days would you recommend?  Best areas?  Best way to organise? Agent or DIY?  Areas or things to avoid and to look out for?    Things we would like:  Camping  Horse riding  Being in nature  Cycling  Hiking/bush walks    Also we would prefer a private car with a knowledgeable guide.    I would appreciate your advice for our first Aftican adventure as I am pretty sure we will come back for more.        Thank you ,Omair M,Kruger National Park,

Good Morning    We will be staying two nights in Cape Town as part of an upcoming SA trip.  Currently we have a hotel room booked at the Hyatt Regency in center-city because we are using points to book but after seeing some reviews it seems like it might not be the best area to stay?  Any insight? We plan on using Ubers to travel around after dark but is that general area safe enough during the day? Additionally we will have a rental car so interested to see how hectic it will be with traffic to get in and out of our hotel at the start and end of our journey. Thank you! ,Adam,Cape Town,
Hi I’m travelling from Royal Natal NP to Badplaas. Google recommends going by Harrismith Vrede Standerton Ermelo Chrissiemeer. Does this seem good ie fast and safe?

Hello everyone    We are on holiday in south Africa and staying near Sedgefield next week. I’m wondering what is the best route from the Cango caves to Cape Town. My own logic tells me to either go north to the N1 then west or south to the N2 then west. However Google is telling me to take a smaller road via calitzdorp and ladyship then join the N2.    I have three questions    1) I want the fastest least hassle route so which one would you take?    2) on your recommended route is there a safe and ideally interesting place to stop half way for a break    3) on your recommended route how long would it take (my experience so far in SA with Google is it takes 60% longer than what Google says!)    Thank you    Lawrence ,Lawrence W,,"London, United..."
Back in July we made a reservation at the Hyatt Regency Cape Town for our visit in April 2024. We received a confirmation email but the hotel never charged our credit card. Recently I emailed the hotel to ask about this and was told they would send me a secure link to pay via Nedbank because South African credit card laws prohibit them from entering the charge manually. However days have gone by and they never sent the link. Is this normal? We're arriving late at night and we don't want to get there and find out they never reserved our rooms. ,BendigoMom,Cape Town,Buffalo

Hello!  We are coming from a trip to Madagascar and spending a few nights in Johannesburg in September 2024 and thought about seeing some wildlife and visiting some park. We could spend one to max. two nights somewhere and thought Kruger would be our best bet. We have been checking the incredibly amount of information that there is online searching for similar topics etc but we are still completely clueless on how to do this therefore just 4 questions:  1) Is Kruger the best option for such a short period of time or is there anywhere else we could do some safari that is not that far away?  2) if Kruger would you fly or would you rent a car and drive all the way from Johannesburg and then ... what? Book a place to stay and drive around the park ourselves?  3) If we want to take it easy and see some wildlife but also have time to stay somewhere in a lodge and maybe see some animals from there what would be the place to be? Close to a river I guess where they will go and drink? Inside or outside the park? We are not on a budget but since this is a long trip with lots of expenses we would prefer not to choose an expensive place.  4) if we end up driving is there anything to see between Johannesburg and Kruger? And where to enter Kruger or where to stay which area?  THANKS A MILLION!! :-) ,Pitsputs,Kruger National Park,

I'm seeing more and more alarming posts on Reddit and other forums about an increase in muggings/assaults on Table Mountain. This is not merely fear-mongering by malicious commenters: There's a warning on the Kirstenbosch Gardens website advising visitors to go up the mountain only in groups of five or larger and many news articles are addressing the issue as well.    My husband (74) and I (66) and our son (32) are planning to visit Cape Town in April and had planned to visit Table Mountain which for me would be a highlight of the trip. Some posts say it's relatively safe to go up in the cable car mid-day but to avoid isolated trails or going up early or late in the day. Can someone who has visited recently (October or November 2023) share their experiences on Table Mountain? ,BendigoMom,Cape Town,Buffalo
Greetings    I am starting to plan a trip to South Africa hoping for some discounts for early bookings. My wife and I will be traveling in November 2024 and I could really use some help planning the itinerary for roughly two weeks.    Background:  While searching for a trip from Europe in early November next year for a special occasion Cape Town turned out to be an ideal location that ticks all the boxes:  - Definitely a bucket list destination and one of the most unique spots on the globe  - Perfect weather/temperature in November  - Convenient connections from Europe flights aren't expensive (compared to other continents)  - Decent rates for boutique and 4* hotels (I am yet to confirm this with more research)  - Daylight until 7-7:30pm (sounds silly but this will be a breath of fresh air after visiting countries closer to the equator)  - Plenty to do within the city especially for the food scene art and architecture  - Kirstenbosch is a must we both enjoy botanical gardens very much. We are not the hiking type but Table Mountain seems easily reachable  - A lot of fantastic points of interest nearby: a significant advantage because it minimizes the need to change accommodation which can be extremely inconvenient. CT can be used as a base for day trips to Winelands Boulders Beach Good Hope Robben Island maybe even Hermanus for whale watching (if it doesn’t start early in the morning)    To be honest I feel like we could spend two fantastic weeks in and around Cape Town and go back home fully satisfied but…    Garden route is also something we definitely want to do as it looks incredible especially in spring (we will be there at its end though). Hopefully it can be done with 1 or 2 base locations (I could use a suggestion where to stop) ending our journey in Port Elisabeth.    And then there’s the hardest decision a question from the subject line: will we have time to visit Kruger National Park. We will be in Africa for the first time and the thought “shouldn’t we go for the best safari” is unavoidable. I am very conflicted with this part of the planning because if we decide to visit KNP I need to change our itinerary and build it around available (and affordable) game reserves.    I found a post from April this year where someone had a similar dilemma he wanted to do a round trip in two weeks: Cape Town – Johannesburg – Kruger – Port Elisabeth – Garden Route – Cape Town. Not long ago I would do the same but I am trying to avoid mistakes from the past when we wanted to see everything and ended up exhausted not enjoying the journey. This time I want our trip to be as relaxing as possible moving at a slower pace being realistic and enjoying what we can. But there is always that fear we will miss something important.    If we do skip Kruger are there any game reserves in the Eastern or Western Cape worth visiting? For example Amakhala or Addo. It should be noted we have seen wild elephants in Asia before but that’s about it. This means we will be thrilled with any kind of game drive if we see the big 5 + a giraffe (my wife’s favorite) at least once.    If we decide to include Kruger it seems there are no direct flights from PLZ to MQP/HDS/SZK we would have to travel via JBN and that sounds exhausting. The only way would be to do the previously mentioned round trip.    Itinerary draft (without KNP with a heavy heart):  - 7 days Cape Town with various day trips  - (Optional) 2 days in the Winelands with overnight (reducing time in CT)  - 4 days Garden Route (would two overnights be enough?)  - (Optional) We may want to try out a beach location if the weather is good for a day or two. Ideally this would be along the Garden Route  - 3 days game reserve somewhere close enough to Port Elisabeth which we will fly out from (layover in JBN)    Thanks in advance for any input  Filip ,Filip,,"Hvar, Croatia"
Planning a safari holiday in the Sand Sand Reserve for August 2024. I’ve been on a fair number of safari holidays typically returning to lodges I’ve been to previously.  My default has always been Londolozi and have stayed at all their camps multiple times with the an exception of Granite. I’ve also been to Selati and Littke Bush Camp at Sabi Sabi Mala Mala Main Camp Dulini Leadwood Exeter River and Chitwa Chitwa. Currently thinking is Sabi Sabi Earth Lodge for some luxury and Mala Mala Main Camp for some crazy game viewing.    Typically travel solo so appreciate lodges that don’t have a single supplement and love a Stay 4 Pay 3 deal. 🤣.    As a creature of habit I return to what I know. Any other lodges in the Reserve I should consider? Any other lodges in adjacent reserves that I should investigate? ,ThomMSeattle,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,"Seattle, Washington"

We thought that maybe we drive towards Nshawu then ending with an overnight stay in Olifants rest camp. 133km driving    The following day Sunday 22nd we would then drive from Olifants towards Skukuza rest camp for an overnight stay then we will depart from Skukuza airport on the Monday afternoon (allowing for an early local game drive around Skukuza). 147 km driving    Does the above itinerary and overnight stops make sense?

If you're planning to go to South Africa and need to apply e-visa I am telling you right now don't even bother to apply. First this has been happening for so many years now and they are unresponsive and doesn't give any information when will you get the evisa. They will hung up on u and if you try to call them they never answer the call. All my travel plan is ruined because of waiting for over a month. Until now no update of my e-visa and I'm not hoping anymore because I already booked a different flight from different country. It's a waste of money paying for e-visa especially the flight I booked to South Africa is also wasted. ,Angelica,,
I encountered the most dangerous moment ever on the way back to return the rental car to the airport. I accidentally drove into an unsafe area up M36 of Michells Plain Philippe and M18 Nyanga. Two guys came to smash my driver's side door and tried to open the door while I stopped for traffic lights. Once they realized it was impossible one guy hinted another guy to run to pick up a brick on the floor 2 meters away. I sped off quickly from the moment...with one hand holding the car door and the other hand driving...all the way to the airport!!! ...🙏  Please do avoid those areas as a traveller! Just want to flag this out if it helps. I feel lucky to be able to escape further danger.  I was solo-driving for 4 days without any issues in other areas. ,kosei1016,Cape Town,"Singapore, Singapore"

Highly considering a safari for my next vacation. It was either Tanzania (four seasons) or ZA (Little Saseka/Royal Malewane). I seem to be leaning towards ZA for the peace of mind in terms of travel and logistics. Will be staying 3 days in terms of the actual lodge. We like a more intimate upscale place with great dining with both (atleast from marketing and reviews we’ve seen) Saseka/Royal Malewane tick all the boxes. Leaning towards Little Saseka at the moment. Any insight would be appreciated! Traveling with an older teen + a close friend/their husband. ,Roo_Travels,Kruger National Park,"Manila, Philippines"

Hi everyone    In February I'll end up my holidays in Western Cape.  I'll be driving from Paarl to Simon's Town to spend a night near Boulders Beach.    Can you recommend the safest road?  Google Maps says N1 - M5 - R310 - M4 but I saw in this forum that this part of M5 might be a smash & grab area.  My hotel recommends the M3 but it would mean that I'd take the N1 until like V&A then N2 then M3. Seems a bit complicated ^^    What do you think?    Thanks a lot.

Hi guys I think I can share some useful info. As I might have stirred up the whole Home Affair a little bit just trying to have my visa on time.  Most of all you need to have an iron determination if you want to get your E-visa through the new system.    We have contacted them via the phone number and email address they published on the e-visa contact form nothing works.    After weeks of trying difference channels emails social medias(yes I even tried social media) we finally find the right contacts for the E-visa issue it feels like all the hard work has not been done in vain.  Here are my suggestions:  1. Visa application: rather straightforward. But I don’t know why for me they are asking for a police clearance document? I honestly have to spend a fortune to book a premier service to have it issued within 3 working days just to leave enough time for the online visa process.  2. Once all the documents been submitted then I am having issue in making a payment the system says ’payment not available’. After more than 10 attempts the payment finally went through on 12 May. However on the system it still shows as ‘awaiting payment’  3. Not payment update until 17 May we know it is not working. So we have emailed all the Home Affairs contact we can find on their website around 15 emails luckily we have heard back from two of them and they have direct me to the right person VL who is dealing with the applications I managed to added her on WhatsApp and send her my application queries.  4. VL has been positive at the beginning saying they will issue me a result with 24 h. Honestly I took that with a pitch of salt as I know it will not go that smoothly if the online system failed update my payment status. Things went the direction I expected VL get back to me saying that my application has not been release from the system due to a missing document. I explained many times that it is because the system is having issue in updating the payment and the payment proof has been emailed to her right at the beginning of our communication. She just overlooked it and saying there is nothing she can do I need to apply from the embassy. God knows how desperate I was when hearing that. This was on 24th May 5 pm and the flight is on 27 May.  5. Then I asked for her boss’s contact she immediately gave me DE’s phone number who is the Home Office Chief Director: Legal Services. I though him might be too high up for this query but I WhatsApped him anyway. (WhatsApp is much more efficient when dealing with South Africans 😊). I know DE has read my message as every time I messaged him he logged on then logged off a few seconds later. I totally appreciate he read the messages as it is after work already. So leave him alone after my 10+ messages. Bless him.  6. On 25th May morning DE what’sapped back and saying that they have their attention on my query and will work on it then he asks me to send the payment proof(which has been emailed over several times) so I did and they located my payment and admit that their system has some issue in showing the payment. On 26th May morning I got my E-visa 30 days. GOOOOOD enough! Great thanks to DE without his escalation there is no way that I can make my trip on time.    Hope they have fixed the system bug but if not and you would like t to have the direct contact details for the staff who deal with E-visa directly please let me know as I am afraid sharing it here in public might lead to illegal spams. ,OYCL,,

I booked and paid for a flight on their website. I was actually charged for the ticket and I got an email saying my e-ticket would arrive in 24 hours. After 6 days several emails and calls (not answered within work hours) to the Kenya branch and the South Africa HQ I am informed that they cannot give me a ticket because the flight is no longer available at the price I paid. So I can fly with other airlines (I booked Qatar for a reason) I can pay a lot more money on top of what I have already paid or I can get a refund.    I chose the refund and I would not recommend Travelstart to anyone. ,nomadictrex,,"York, United Kingdom"

Hi  I land at Cape Town airport at lunch time on a Sunday.  Can I buy a local sim card with data at the airport please?  Usually at most airports there are stalls where you can do this where they set it up on your mobile for you - this is VERY important as I'm not very 'techie'.  I've discounted setting up an e Sim card before I go as it looked too complicated (& I have no-one to help me).  My android Samsung has a dual Sim facility.  I've never used this before but I'm hoping that my existing UK sim stays in 1 slot & I can switch over to it when I have to do any financial transaction or anything needing dual authentication etc (this has been the bane of my life when travelling - I need to do all sorts of transactions relating to my business).  If I can get a local Sim card set up at the airport what apps etc do I need to download before leaving the airport building (presumably using the free airport at the airport).  I know that I'll need Uber (& Bolt?).  I need at least Uber set up on my 'phone before I leave the airport.  This is because I'm staying in an apartment in Green Point & on my 1st day of sightseeing I will need to book an Uber......  I'll probably need Waze & Google Maps (I'll be in Cape Town for 6 days first using Uber & then I have a hire car for 25 days to do the Garden Route).  Any help on this would be much appreciated. ,Christine B,Cape Town,Fordingbridge...

Is it worth making a detour North from Villiersdorp to Worcester and Montagu? We plan to gofrom De Hoop onto Oudtshoorn via Swellendam Barrydale Ladismithbut don't want to miss the best bits of R62. ,Annepeter9999,Western Cape,"Halifax, United..."

Planning my first ZA Safari trip. I have narrowed it down to Little Saseka/ Or Royal Malewane. As per my research both are in a malaria risk area. I would assume and hope that these more upscale lodges would take more efforts in ensuring guest safety so we don’t plan on taking any pills due to the fact of the side effects being very off putting and probably ruining our vacation.    We will be taking precautions such as mosquito sprays and repellent (already live in a mosquito prevalent country with serious diseases aswell) so we are aware of risks but would like anyone’s opinion on the risks aswell as experience with malaria pills (specifically malarone as I’ve been told the best) and as to if it’s worth the steep cost for the safety. Insight would be appreciated :) ,Roo_Travels,Kruger National Park,"Manila, Philippines"

Apologies if this question is reappearing again as I'm sure I've posted it late last night but can't seem to find the thread.  I need a sense check from the experts on here please.  Our plans have now changed and we're doing JNB-KNP LS-Satara-Letaba-Sabie-JNB-CPT.  We land in JNB 07:25 at the end of this month. Pick up car and hope to be on the way by 10:30 doing R21/N12/N4 with the aim of arriving in Crocodile Bridge accommodation outside KNP by 17:00 (stock up provisions at Spar in Malelane?).  Following morning enter KNP through Crocodile Bridge Gate and head toward Lower Sabie for 1 night.  Then onto Satara for the next 2 nights and finally Satara a further 2 nights. Any suggestions for areas to visit around these 2 rest camps is welcome.  On leaving KNP we’ll exit Phalaborwa onto R40/R530/R36/R532 and overnighting in Sabie.  Our flight from JNB to CPT leave the next day at 13:00 and get into CPT at 15:10 so we aim to leave Sabie around 07:30. Is this enough time or should we overnight a bit closer in Dullstroom?    Are the above sensible timing routes and safety? Thanks for checking and inputs. ,birkbeck-r-us,Kruger National Park,London

Hello Everybody.  Does anybody have experience or knowledge as to hoe safe the Greenpoint area is compared to Camp's Bay? I have narrowed down to 2 choices of places to book. One is in Green Point near the High Level Road and close to V&A. The other is near to Camps Bay and fairly close to Bakoven Beach. Are these areas OK to walk around a bit during the day without having to Uber all the time? We are not flashy or silly people and want to be sensible without feeling over paranoid. We are staying about a week and our main interests will be Nature related like Whale watching Penguins Botanical Garden etc. Many thanks in advance for any advice ,LeizaBee,Cape Town,

We will be in South Africa for 25 weeks in March 2024 and are struggling with our plan for the KZN-part of our trip (4-5 days). We are mostly interested in doing game drives (either self drive or guided) in iMfolozi-Hluhluwe the hippo-crocodile boat tour in iSimangaliso and possibly snorkeling in Cape Vidal.    We will be coming to KZN via Durban after 5 days in Cape Town. After KZN we will be driving on to Swaziland (probably staying in Hlane) then the Graskop area for hopefully some scenic walks and finally flying home from Johannesburg. We are avoiding the Kruger for malaria reasons.    Given the above what would be the best place(s) to stay in KZN? We are thinking perhaps 1 night in Hilltop Camp followed by 3 nights in St Lucia? Or would it be better to stay (1 or all nights) in Mtubatuba or in Hluhluwe? Are there other activities you would recommend? Should we also aim to do a game drive in iSimangaliso or will we see enough of the area when driving to Cape Vidal?    Thanks! ,Emma v,KwaZulu-Natal,

Hi all    I’d be grateful for some advice please. After Cape Town we have 3 nights in Franschhoek next March from the Friday until Monday. I’m not sure how best to visit the wine estates and if we were to go on the wine tram which colour route would be best to go on.  Me and my husband like wine but don’t know much about it.  Also I see restaurants at the wine estates are open in the evening; if we were to go to one for dinner how do we get there and back.  Or are we better going on one if the coloured routes on the tram and planning our day to also include lunch somewhere: I see sone of the estates have a range of activities such as horse riding and cycling. I have had a look at one of the wine estate Boschendal and that looks very nice for lunch.    I see there’s also a market in franschhoek on the Saturday is it best to do this and then leave the wine tram until the Sunday.    Sorry for all the questions just a little bit of help would be much appreciated.    Many thanks  Ashley ,asherguernsey,,"Guernsey, United..."

Hi - I have had a bit of earlier advice on shopping for self catering in our 6 night 7 day KNP self drive. Our first night being Talamati - we will need to have some food for a braii and would like to have snacks/water etc for the rest of our time in the park (letaba and Lower Sabie) but understand that there is plenty of restaurants to accomodate most meals. So - where should we shop considering are doing the Panorama route from Sabie - Graskop and around the top to Blyde River Canyon Lodge for the night. We had been advised to to Hoedspruit but its a round about way to get to Orpen gate and we plan on leaving early to enter the park about 6;00 to 6:30 so i'm sure theres nothing open? We also have to buy a cooler to carry anything. So? Can we just do a quick shop in Mbombela after getting the car or Sabie Graskop. I was also thinking of asking the folks at the lodge if it was something they could provide at a price for the hassle but it would be very convenient for us! Our stay overnight is Jan 27 in park until Feb. 3/2024 ,okemabeach,Kruger National Park,"Saskatoon, Canada"

I had been assuming we would rent a car for 5 days in Cape Town (after a self-drive safari in Botswana) but now I'm second guessing myself. We will be staying in Seapointe and doing all the usual things.  Are Uber for 4 passengers readily available?  I think that airport transfer would be easy to schedule with our hotel.  We would likely spend one day doing the HOHO bus.  On the day when we do Table Mountain and the Gardens I'm thinking that an Uber would suffice. Or can we explore more in the areas with a vehicle of our own?  V&A Waterfront restaurants etc would likely be easier by Uber than trying to park.  For a daytrip to the wineries having a private driver would be better than someone in the group having to not drink.  The one day I would definitely want a car would be for Cape Point so we could explore at our own pace.  I would also be interested in a township tour for a day or half day so again wouldn't need a car?  On a previous trip to SA we had a car for the Panorama Route and Kruger NP and did extensive driving. I was assuming this would be the same but I'm second guessing myself on this!  Thoughts? ,DrDebi,Cape Town,Rochester Hills...

Good afternoon    Me and my girlfriend have booked the ANEW hotel green point Cape Town for our 8 night stay starting this sunday- the 5th Dec. I have just read a review from the start of nov that said the pool and rooftop was closed for the whole two weeks of someone’s stay… now we planned to use the pool a fair bit and obviously if it’s closed we will not be wanting to stay at that hotel. So I have tried to find a direct email but cannot as it’s a general group hotel email so I am kindly requesting if someone could use the number to call and ask for me if the pool will be open as usual please?    I would be very grateful ,Lewis J,Cape Town,

My husband and I are travelling to the UK in June. I have registered and submitted all the necessary info for our Visa's on the GOV.UK website and paid our fees.    I've done a number of visa applications for various countries before including 2 previously for the UK so I am fairly comfortable with the process.    Final step is to book an appointment for Biometrics via the TLSContact website.    The GOV.UK system takes you to the TLS website automatically and allows you to book an appointment but I have yet to receive a confirmation email.    I've attempted to book an appointment at their Port Elizabeth office for next week Wednesday.    Both the TLSContact website and GOV.UK refer to the appointment confirmation email and how I need it to attend my appointment.    Its been almost 2 working days now and still no email. I've emailed their contact centre but my hopes of a reply there are low.    I'm not sure what to do has anyone else had problems receiving their email confirmation?    I've noted this company appears to have recently (like in the past 2 months) taken over the process here in SA and now I'm wondering if they are having trouble?

Have started to plan for a one week stay at the park for a family of four July 2024. Our first time on safari and in Kruger. Arriving from Uk are hoping to fly out at the end to Cape Town. Would be grateful for comments.    Day 1 Arrive JNB 9.25AM transfer to airport hotel - City or Garden Court    Day 2 catch 10am flight to Nelspruit hire car drive to Crocodile Bridge    3 nights Stay at Crocodile Bridge and self drive safaris in park including Lowe Sabie area    Day 5 Drive up to Satara Rest Camp for one night stay    Day 6 Drive up to Balule 3 night stay private lodge    Day 9 Drive to Hoedspruit airport drop off car and catch flight to Cape Town    I hope this isn't too much driving for us as we wanted to make it as relaxing as possible so prefer 3 nights stays rather than 2 and also to enjoy each area. Hopefully the itinerary allows for enjoying different terrains and so animals? We are most interested in big cats especially leopards. Originally had hoped to book Sabi Sands but no availability at more reasonably priced camps for our dates. Also Lower Sabie Rest Camp no availability.    Have I allowed enought time to get up to Satara from Crocodile Bridge? We will want to stop for lunch and sightings on the way up so hope we do not have to hurry? The following day would we have time to enjoy the surrounding area before heading to Balule and arriving in time for evening safari?    Finally we have not booked international flights yet but how soon should we booking the domestic flights? Its such alot of money to commit at once!

As well as doing the tourist things in the city we would also like to include a safari and either whale watching / white shark watching.

Hi all    As part of our 10-day trip to the Western Cape Region we will spend the final 4 days in the winelands (after spending 4 nights in Cape Town and 2 in Sanbona). We decided to split up between 2 nights near Stellenbosch (the Jordan Suites) and 2 nights in downtown Franschhoek.    We are particularly interested in good quality wine (bold reds big whites and noble rot dessert wines) and fine dining. Since taking wine home won't really be an option for intercontinental flight we are especially looking for nice experiences and not for buying. For the tastings we value quality over quantity.    We already have a booking for the boekenhoutskloof winery and De Toren is very high on our shortlist. We read about wine blending workshops at Middelvlei Rickety Bridge and winemaker for a day at Cafe du Vin in Franschhoek. Does somebody know which of these will offer the best quality experience? And do you have other recommendations for wineries to visit?    For lunch and dinner we will have lunch once at Jordan (dinner isn't possible on our days there) and we are considering Epice for dinner in Franschhoek. Our flight leaves around midnight so we are considering lunch at Petit Colombe before heading back. However we will also visit La Colombe during our nights in Cape Town will it be worth to do both? And do you have other recommendations for dinner near Jordan and Franschhoek both fancy or slightly more low-key?    Thanks in advance! ,erikkie39,Western Cape,"The Hague, The..."
My wife and I just returned from a 2 week trip to South Africa. The first week we were on Safari in the northeast part of the country; the second week we flew to CapeTown.    Prior to leaving on the trip my wife did much research on tour guides in Cape Town and as a result came upon a great review of tour guide Hank founder of Ulungele Tours and Safaris. What a great “find” he was. As a result we contacted him via email before we left on our trip as we had many questions as you might imagine. Hank couldn’t have been nicer and more patient answering everything we threw at him.    Upon finally meeting him at our hotel we spend the entire day touring with him as our guide as he drove us in one of his clean first rate vehicles from Cape Town down the peninsula to the Cape of Good Hope. He is/was so friendly and knowledgable on all subjects about his native South Africa. He was our history geography and sociology professor all in one.    Pricing was excellent; well worth the time he spent with us. Door to door service with refreshments inside his vehicle. He allowed us to spend as much time as we wanted at each of his suggested stops. In fact he took us to a really nice restaurant in Simonton for lunch on our drive back.    So if you’re thinking about visiting Cape Town and are in need of an A-1 tour guide to help you navigate all the sites that CP has to offer your fist and only choice should be Ulungele. And be sure to ask for Hank. ,Robert C,,

Hello.    I'm a bit shocked at the prices Europcar and Avis are now charging Bluu (used to be Bidvest) are rather cheaper. Anyone have any information on reliability/maintenance of their cars how good are they when things go wrong etc. ? I appreciate they have less locations than the main suppliers but does that mean they can't help you so easily when you break down or have problems with the car? Any experiences good or bad greatly welcomed please! Thank you in advance. ,annie0nline,,"London, United..."
My husband and I are planning a trip to Southern Africa for our 10 year anniversary in Sept 2024. We'd like to do Cape Town and the Winelands and spend some time on safari. We've never been anywhere in Africa and I'm struggling to sift through all the information available. We have a budget of ~10k US.    We are thinking that for our first trip a tour company might be best. But any recommendations on tour companies or how to even go about booking this myself would be greatly appreciated! ,RPSalinas,,North Carolina
Hi again. Many of you were very helpful in answering my question regarding doing Kruger and avoiding bumpy off-roads (my wife has back issues).    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293740-i9186-k14574332-Kruger_etc_on_our_own_but_avoiding_bumpy_off_roads-South_Africa.html#119203571    I’ve since done a lot of research and watched numerous videos and what started as perhaps a 5-7 visit to Kruger has now stretched to 16-20 days (it gets longer every day!) I feel that with a longer stay we can take things at a slower pace and really immerse ourselves in the park. We’d also like to spend entire days here and there in the camps such as at Olifants and keep our drives between camps relatively short. With that in mind for a trip in perhaps September or October of 2024 I’ve come up with the following. I’m not sure whether we’ll go North-South or South-North; that will depend somewhat on bungalow/cabin availability (for example it looks like Shingwedzi has no availability for a big block of days in mid-September.    We’ll self-drive and only stay at rest camps that have restaurants/food options.    With that in mind how does this sound? Are there any places where you would add or take away days? Any places we should go instead?    Punda Maria: 2 nights (my wife loves birds)  Shingwedzi: 4 nights  Letaba or Olifants (probably Olifants): 2 nights  Satara: 2-4 nights  Lower Sabie: 3-4 nights  Berg-en-Dal: 3-4 nights    As for the rest of our trip I’ll figure that out after we figure out the Kruger part.    Thank you again  Dave ,Davetroy,Kruger National Park,"Plantation, Florida"

We are planning to arrive Cape Town on Dec 6. Our rough itin is  1. Day 1-2 : Land in Cape Town and explore  2. Day 3-7: Garden route with overnight stops  3. Day 7-9: Amakhala Game Reserve  4. Day 10 - Fly back to Cape Town and head home  We have a 5 yr old with us. I am wondering if we can stay outside the game reserves or do we have to stay at the game reserve lodges.  Does Amakhala allow self drive in our vehicle since they wont allow a 5 yr old on game drives  Are there other recommendations for how we should structure the itin for 5 yr old and malaria free safaris ,ggupta1120,Amakhala Game Reserve,Washington DC...

So we have a flight booked on Airlink with a 6:00 a.m. departure. We are connecting in JNB to an international flight on Airlink. The Airlink ticket info says to check in 3 hours before the flight or risk having the tickets cancelled. The translates to 3:00 a.m. Because of the international connection we can't check-in online so will have to do it in person. There is no possible reason we need to be at the airport at 3:00 except if their system is inflexible enough that they actually will cancel our tickets if not checked in by 3 hours ahead. Seems ridiculous but not sure we want to risk it. Any experience with Airlink that would confirm that check-in at an hour and half or two hours is sufficient for this circumstance? Thanks. ,TravellerPGH,Cape Town,Pittsburgh...
Hi we are starting our self drive near Hoedspruit - was going to go into Kruger via Orpen gate as it's the closest to Talamati for our first night but i'm now thinking of going in at Phalaborwa gate and try and do the Mopani area before heading south to Talamati and then when we go to Letaba for second stay we wouldnt have to go up as far as Mopani? (not sure for newbies if we need to go that far north the first time but it sounds beautiful and we are avid birders as well as safari newbies. Then lastly Lower Sabie and do the lower part of the park. Any and all advice appreciate. Thanks Bonnie and Brian - Canada ,okemabeach,Kruger National Park,"Saskatoon, Canada"

Hi all I was wondering if you could provide advice on my proposed itinerary. Please note we are a young couple in our 30 years who like to be active and to see as much as possible whilst on holidays. We like to move around and going slow isn't part of our travel style. We will have 10 nights in the Seychelles prior for relaxation.    Day 1: Arrive Johannesburg at 12.30 // Visit city with tour  Day 2: Panorama route (early departure from JBurg) and overnight in Graskop  Day 3: Morning visit to Blyde Canon and check into private game by 14:30  Day 4: Private Game Full day  Day 5: Private Game in AM depart and enter Kruger (self-drive)  Day 6: Self Drive Kruger Full day  Day 7: Morning self-drive towards Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport for flight 13.25 departure // Collect hire car // Explore V&A Cape Town in evening  Day 8: Coastal route towards Cape of Good Hope // Overnight stay in vineyard near Stellenbosch  Day 9: Full day exploring wine region - Stellenbosch overnight  Day 10: Francheosk Full day and overnight stay  Day 11: Early departure to Hermanus // Whale Tour // Cliff walk // Overnight stay  Day 12: Drive Hermanus to Mossel Bay with stops on route // Overnight stay  Day 13: Mossel Bay towards Knysna stops on route // Overnight stay  Day 14: Activities in and around Knysna // overnight stay in Plet Bay  Day 15: Full Day in Plet (Hike & beaches etc.) // overnight stay in Plet Bay  Day 16: Tsitsikamma National Park durng day / Evening Port Elizabeth  Day 17: Fly from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town (Drop off hire car) / Evening Cape Town  Day 18: Full day in Cape Town  Day 19: Full day in Cape Town until 20.00 // International flight departs at 23.00    What do you think of the itinerary? Does it sound right or too much/short time in certain places? The one place that concerns me is Johannesburg. We want to see it but are aware that we won't get into city until 15.00 and only have an evening. We could drive straight to graskop that night instead but thought it would be a shame not to see Johannesburg albeit very quickly.    Thanks in advance!

Hi This is my first time participating in a forum. I probably should have asked questions previously but I tried to search for answers in the South Africa forums. We are planning a trip to South Africa in September 2024. We have found a great tour planner and many of the details have been worked out. We will be in South Africa for 3 weeks; we will spend 3 days at Pafuri Tented camp and then 3 days at Kruger rest camp hopefully at Olifants. We will have a car. We would like to have a private game drive for one day or morning or afternoon. Our reasons being to have fewer people in vehicle for good visibility and maybe having a more experienced read certified guide. I know that Sansparks at Kruger now offers that option at some camps but you have to ask when you get there. Is it possible to hire someone or some tour operator outside the camp who can pick you up at your rest camp or do we have to drive outside the park to meet them? Does anyone have any experience using the Kruger private guides?  I have heard that Elephant Herd Lawson's Heritage and Shinzelle are good. We are not averse to doing group drive from Kruger camp. I know for sunset and or night drives you have to use their guides and vehicles. After Kruger we go to Sabi Sand private reserve for 4 nights so I am sure we should get excellent guides there. Cost is not the major deciding factor but we don't want need anything luxurious either. Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me. ,PolishFalcon,Kruger National Park,North Carolina...
Following one of the other threads I'd like to seek the considered opinion of travelling Baden Powel Dr the R310.    I'll be in Cape Town in February and one of my day plans is along these lines. I'll be staying in central Cape Town and I want to drive along the False Bay coast. My plan is to take the N2 out one morning leaving after 9am. Then at Baden Powel take the turning and head to the coast. Follow the road until I can pick up Lukannon Dr a little nearer the coast.    Onwards to Muzinberg and get a Brunch there or at St James while I explore around a little. In the afternoon take Boyes Dr to Kirstenbosch botanical Gardens and later return to central Cape Town around 5pm.    Is this partical in terms of travel distance and time available. Is it safe particularly the N2/R310 juntions and the road to the coast or risky? ,Neil B,,"Ormskirk, United..."

Hi All    After a little advice.    We've booked a trip to Cape Town plus garden route before heading to Mauritius for a week - 'we' are 2 adults and two teenagers (16 and 14) - all physically fit.    Our travel agent has booked us:  2 nights in Cape Town  1 night Hermanus  2 nights in Plett  3 nights in Kuzuko  7 nights Mauritius    My question is the garden route element - have we got time? Is this doable? We have a car but I don't want to spend all the time in it to just see the odd spot for 30mins.  Think our TA may have been ambitious now we've done more research. Wondering if those of you in the know can give some friendly kind feedback    Thanks in advance ,KatrinaB,Cape Town,

Hello all    I am orienting myself for a 4 week trip in July / August 2025 with my husband and kids who will then be 12 and 14. Main reason to go is to see the animals and nature. As we'll have a bit longer I'd like to make it an interesting roadtrip with some variety of activities.    What worked well for us in the past is:  - 3 nights per location so there are 2 days to experience the location and then one day to drive (with stops along the way)  - Alternate the main reason of visit (safaris) with other activities (cities mountains culture history outdoor activities)  - Fly to one city and fly back from another    We are a first time visitor and I do not expect to go back soon (as we have many other continents to discover as well). However I have no ambition to see it all as I realize that's impossible.    So if you had 4 weeks for South Africa (and around) what would you do with it?    Thanks! ,Sparhawk222,,"The Hague, The..."

Hi everyone  I have reserved a car with Avis in Cape Town however the requirements are rather strange. They asked for two credit cards on the name of the main driver driver's license in english passport and driver's license issued by the same country. Did anyone have any issues with renting the car with an EU license (that is not written in english) and without an international driver's license? I reside in a different country than the one that issued my passport and I can't obtain an international license in my country of residence. Also I don't have 2 credit cards on my name never had this issue ever before.  I have asked Avis ZA for advice however so far I received 3 different answers that do not help at all thought maybe someone had a similar situation and could share their experience. Thanks a lot in advance. ,A J,Cape Town,

We are arriving in Cape Town on December 16th and are getting our rented car at 8am on Sunday December 17th. Then the plan is to drive to the Cape of Good Hope seeing the penguins the lighthouse and whatever else that area offers. On the way back we’d like to taste some wine at Groot Constantia.    My question is: Are we planning too much for the first day when we are jet lagged? The next day (the last one when we have a car in Cape Town) we plan to spend about 4 hours hiking on the Table Mountain and then visit the botanic gardens so I wonder whether it might be logistically easier to pay a visit to Groot Constantia then. How long is the sheer drive to Cape Point one way and how busy would it be on a Sunday in December?    Any insights will be appreciated.    Boris ,Boris V,Cape Town,"Reston, Virginia"
Hi  I am a 51yo solo female traveller travelling to Cape Town in January. Very excited! I have a 5 day Garden Route tour booked with an operator but then have a week in Cape Town on my own. I have some idea of activities i want to do but wondering about where to stay.  I am currently thinking about staying in a couple of different backpackers to mix it up a bit one Never at Home in Green Point and the other Ashanti Lodge Backpackers on Hof Street.  I wondered if anyone knew the areas and what both the hostels were like any pros/cons and if either better or worse for an older female traveller on own.  May also help decide if i should just stay at one rather than spend time moving between the two or getting to know some people for a few nights (hopefully!) then to just move off to another so better to just stay at one.  Never at Home looks more appealing location wise just from research have done....nearer stuff to do in day nearer water the other one seems maybe just better for night life which i'm not sure I would really appreciate like i might used to have done a few years ago! but the former more expensive so is it worth spending more?  I know it just comes down to personal taste to a certain extent but any local knowledge or insight welcome!  Thanks in advance for your help.  LR72 ,LR72,Cape Town,"Brighton, United..."
Are VISA and Amex credit cards accepted in Kruger's Lower Sabie Rest camp? ,Luis H,Kruger National Park,"Mexico City, Mexico"
Words of wisdom please.    We'll be arriving in CPT noon 05 Dec 23 and have a total of 9 nights in SA. It's going to be our 1st time to SA and want to incorporate a self drive safari so looking at Addo Elephant Park (AEP) or perhaps to the much bigger park - Kruger.    We're looking to allocate 5 nights in Cape Town 2 nights in AEP 1 night on the garden route and 1 night spare (our flight home is 18:00 from CPT).    Option 1) AEP first.    Catch the next flight upon arrival to Port Elizabeth airport (PLZ) stay in the vacinity overnight thus using up the spare night.    The following morning pick up a rental car drive south to Colchester enter the gate there stay 1 night at Matyholweni Camp.    Next day head north and stay overnight at Addo main camp (night 3).    Start the Garden Route (GR) back to Cape Town the following morning with an overnight stop at Knysna (night 4)    And the second half of the GR is straight to Cape Town to spend the remaining 5 nights there.    (Should we do a one-way rental? Or just fly straight from PLZ to CPT and pick up another car from there - but this means we won't have experienced the GR. Upside is we can allocate that 1 night for the Langebaan area to try out the vineyards that way?)      Option 2) Go to Kruger  Instead of flying to PLZ we could fly to Mpumalanga (MQP).    Similar itinerary pick car up following morning enter the south west gate and head to Lower Sabie stay there 2 nights.    Then head to Skukuza camp for the 1 night (night 4).    Back to the airport in the morning for flight to CPT and spend the rest of the time there.    Is option 2 too ambitious?    Thank you for any advice/inputs from personal experiences. ,birkbeck-r-us,Cape Town,London
Hi    We are planning our honeymoon in Cape Town Mauritius and Kruger National Park safari.    I am lost in choosing a right lodge for you. Initially I wanted to choose honeymoon suite at AM lodge but reviews says that its reserve does not have big 5 and food is awful. As a foodie I am torn while I don’t mind driving longer for a better reserve.    Do you have any recommendation? Our budget is not really high but not too low either. Willing to stretch $ 1k per night.    Good reserve with big 5 good food luxury facilities and romantic environment. Friendly staffs are most important but it seems every place has them.

Hi  I need to book somewhere for my 3 day visit to Addo (from 25 Jan 2024).  It's proving a bit tricky.  I need WIFI (for business reasons)  I need self catering facilities (dietary problems)  I've pretty much abandoned any thoughts of staying in Addo NP itself.  I found somewhere on Booking dot com (Avoca River Cabins) which looked good.  6 miles to Addo.  Then I saw there was no wifi in the units no lights for loadshedding.  A reviewer also said that the access road from the R336 to the cabin was rough.  Access roads seem to be a tricky problem.  I have a hire car so I'm not keen on risking any difficult.  (also I'm a solo female traveller aged 67 so I really don't want anything risky).  I then tried Air B & B.  I thought I'd struck lucky with Ndlovu Addo River Lodge.  It had wifi private kitchen and virtually no load shedding problems (solar).  Then I read the reviews.  Some guests had very serious problems getting their cars in & out - needing to drive deep into the outback 20 mins from main road & needing a 4 x 4.  I've alread seen that the R335 is not recommended.  It seems like there are all sorts of issues around Addo NP.  Can anyone give me any suggestions for somewhere safe to stay with a safe road please?  Thanks.  Christine Bennett ,Christine B,Cape Town,Fordingbridge...
Hi  It's me again.  I'm still working on my route.  I'll stick to the Garden Route from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth (+ a trip up to Addo Elephant NP).  I would like to do some of Route 62 on the way back but perhaps not all of it?  It seems to start just north of Oyster Bay - maybe I could skip this bit?  It looks as though I could instead get up to Route 62 from Plettenburg on the R340/R339.  Is this a good idea?  Otherwise I could continue to George & then head inland (N12?) through the Outeniqua Pass to Oudtshoorn.  Then I'd be happy to continue on Route 62 right through to Montagu then on to Robertson & link back in to the Winelands area somehow (my map isn't terribly helpful here as it stops just after Robertson.....

Hello. We want to book a taxi for New Years Eve to travel from V & A to Long Street. We can’t book with Uber. Excite taxis don’t reply. We want to book early to be assured of a safe ride. We need a taxi company with an email so we can understand where they would pick us up. We can’t just do an online booking because we don’t know enough details. We will attend the NYE parade which presumably ends around midnight so would want a taxi to pick us up circa 12.30 but we would not know where from.

Hi everyone    I was born in South Africa and left when I was 11 years old. My parents applied for Australian citizenship with no intention to keep our South African citizenship and as such our South African passports expired and some 17 years later we all only have Australian passports.    I am about to go back on Saturday for the first time (unusual I know!) and have learned today that you if your parents applied for your foreign citizenship before you were 18 years old you do not lose your South African citizenship and therefore I will be considered a dual citizen for the rest of my days.    Obviously the significant problem I now face is that I don't have a South African passport nor will I be able to get one in time and I have absolutely no South African ID cards.    I spoke to the Consulate today and all she could tell me was that I needed to enter on a SA passport or I'll risk a fine. She could not give me a straight answer as to whether I would be denied entry.    Has anyone had this happen to them? I'm really worried that I will be denied entry at the border and have to return. I obviously had no idea that my citizenship would remain in tact when my parents' citizenship did not.    Any help would be much appreciated. ,Claire R,,

Hello  I’m busy planning our trip in March next year. I have already booked Cape Town and the surrounding wine lands.  I need help on where to go/stay after our 3 nights in Hermanus ? We have 3 more night to stay somewhere before our stop in Oudtshoorn.  I’m hoping to travel to Oudtshoorn via the R62 as we will be visiting Mossel Bay and the garden route after Oudtshoorn. Can anyone recommend somewhere to stay that has enough to do for 3 days. I was thinking Arniston or Witsand? Any advice welcome.  We could add an extra night in Hermanus which would then leave just a 2 night stay between there and Oudtshoorn.  Thank you in advance ,Caroline M,,
We will be in RSA/KZN the week of 10-17 December. I am looking for lodges focused on wildlife and birdlife viewing. Luxury is secondary or tertiary in the preferences. We want lodges that offer safaris for small groups or private tours.    The price budget is between 300-500 USD/night. Ideally including the safari charges.    Any guidance will be appreciated. ,GBTravel,KwaZulu-Natal,

We are most likely going to be in the Kruger in November for a whole month!    What can we expect in terms of weather? Occasional rain or continuous for days?    We where there end of Feb this year and enjoyed the weather though there were a couple of days of continuous rain. How does November/December differ to Feb/March?    We want to be there for the birds but my partner is concerned about continuous rainy days. ,Jonathan R,Kruger National Park,
In between stays/safaris at private reserves I'd like to stay in either Hazyview or Hoedspruit to take a tour of the Panorama Route. Also to exercise do some laundry and chill.    Does anyone know of a hotel/lodge with laundry and fitness rooms that are relatively close to the town centers? If there is a lap pool somewhere I could also do laps. I won't have a car so I'd like it to be walkable or bikeable if there are bikes available.    If these hotel/lodges don't exist are there laundry or workout facilities in either town? I can't seem to find what I'm looking for.... Thanks in advance. ,mooth,Kruger National Park,"Raleigh, North..."
Hi All    My partner(M27) and I(F33) will be going to SA over NYE and the first 10 days of the new year. Generic route: Cape Town Cape Winelands Garden Route flight to Joburg Drakensberg Kruger.  Now i have quite a few questions that I am hoping the people of Tripadvisor can help me with.      First few items are obviously around safety we have travelled before to some less safe countries (Mexico/USA/Colombia etc). But still some reports of SA have us concerned. I read most post and am left with two specific questions.  1. We have now rented a car as soon as we land in Capetown (middle of day) because we want to go to like boulder beach/Chapmans peak drive/Cape of Good hope. All smaller distances will be taxi our tour. Would it be wiser to not pick up the car till we leave the city? (Its merely safety I'm concerned about)    2. We will be staying in an airbnb at Bree and Prestwich is this a safe area for walking very short distances toward the waterfront and back? E.g. we have a reservation at Gold Restaurant which is a literal 12 minute walk every bone in my European body says to not take an Uber for that.    3. Not safety related we are contemplating either Stellenbosch or Franschoek for one night before heading in the garden route. We are leaning toward Franschoek because of the tram and we are not planning on driving after all the wine😋  but Stellenbosch is a household name in NL so I feel bad ruling it out does Stellenbosch have anything Franschoek doesnt (its only one night so size of the actual town isnt that relevant to me).    4. We are self driving in Kruger (have nights booked at Berg en Dal Satara and Mopani) what kind of car do we need (like absolut minimal requirements be able to drive there).    5. We (only) have two nights between Franschoek/Stellenbosch and Port Elizabeth. Currently we are looking at overnights in Hermanus and Knysna does this make sense?    Apologies for all the text but in previous threads I saw people asking for more detail to give good advice and I was not gonna let that happen to me. ,Kath1990,Cape Town,"The Hague, The..."

First time for me to Africa and indeed Cape Town and looking for advice! I've done some reading of posts already regarding safety/areas etc but after some feedback.... I will be travelling to CT for a conference late Nov/early December and am adding on a week for a holiday. I'm booked at Hotel Sky near the CTICC for convenience (9 nights) - so should I consider moving elsewhere after the conference (5 nights)? I'm a solo female traveler wont be hiring a car so would like to be able to walk for dining options - or uber etc. Accommodation wise I am thinking either to stay near the waterfront area or move to be seaside etc. I will be considering things like winery tours seeing local attractions (penguins/table top etc) hop-on/hop/off tours - plus a bit of relaxing possibly poolside. Budget wise nothing too flashy/pricey. Any suggestions to move after my work trip? bearing in mind i'm a newbie to CT and travelling alone. Thanks! ,Kiwigirl001,Cape Town,Auckland Central...

Hi  My trip is fairly long (6 days Cape Town & then 25 days Garden Route to Addo NP & back (along part of N62).  The 1st part of the drive doesn't look very interesting.  It will be early January so no whale watching in Hermanus.  I'm tempted to 'crack on' to Mossel Bay before staying for a number of nights.  I don't much like single night stays.  However it looks like the drive from Cape Town to Mossel Bay could be 5 hrs (+ stop times).  I travel solo so I can't share the driving.  My gut feeling is that maybe I should stay somewhere for 1 night.  Any suggestions or advice on this would be welcome.  Thanks  Christine Bennett ,Christine B,Cape Town,Fordingbridge...

We had a great family holiday in this area 2 years ago. We are returning again and have booked 3 nights at Kosi mouth for beach and snorkeling 5 nights at a lodge at Kuleni game reserve near Hluhluwe where we will do day trips to Hluhluwe Mkuze and Western Shores. We have another 2 nights to book somewhere else and I was thinking Mpila or a private reserve where we can do a guided safari. I suspect we wont get as far as Mpila area on our day trips which is why I am considering this area ,Heidi O,Hluhluwe,
We are travelling independently with a car and staying near the battlefields. We enquired about doing a tour but it is 3400 rand using our own car which seems very expensive for one day for two people. I see that there are museums at Isandlwana and Rorke’s Drift. Maybe not one at Blood River. We are thinking that this will be enough for us. It seems hard to find genuinely independent reviews on this subject. ,Kat T,,"Twickenham, United..."
Hello Everyone    I’m having trouble finding the right information on nonprescription drugs entering SA. I usually fly with motion sickness pills and stomach relief pills as a precaution. The customs website gives very broad information on this since it is nonprescription. Would I be allowed to bring it into the country (Cape Town specifically)? If not can local pharmacies sell these kinds of medications without a prescription?    Thank You  Zack F. ,Zack F,,"Malibu, California"

We will drive from Windhoek to Cape Town for a month in July/August 2024.    I know that 4WD is easier but as it costs £900 extra is it necessary? Or is something like a Toyota Urban Cruiser 1.5 sufficient?    Trip is Windhoek Waterburg Twyefelfontein Spitzkoppe Swakopmund Sossusvlei Luderitz Fish River area Clan Willian/Cederburg area Cape Town.    We are staying in lodges/hotels not camping.    We won't be going to Etosha or Skeleton Coast. And in Fish River we will take a paid tour if we don't have a 4WD. Bonus if we can catch Namaqualand flowers but might be a little early. ,Cygnet,,"London, United..."

Dear All  We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 child aged 5 and 8) are planning a 12 day trip to South Africa landing and departure from Johannesburg.  Can I know what will be the cost for a not so luxury trip for us considering we plan on having a 2 night Safari at KNP. Other than Safari we haven’t got the chance to research much (as I’m too tied up at work) but initial assessment shows that there’s option for Garden Route cover Durban Port Elizabeth and Cape Town before flying back to Joberg.    My concern is how much would the trip cost including the car rental/ lodging/ food/ activities and then flight back to Joberg from CapeTown.  What should a good itinerary be for these 12 days that can suit to our needs.  Really need some expert help here to really plan it well (including if it fits our budget of approx USD 4000 all inclusive) cause we are already short of time I think now with Dec being a busy season. ,Jahanzaib R,,"Karachi, Pakistan"

Hi all    My family (2 couples with kids in early 20s) is planning a trip to SA for the first time next summer. This was supposed to be my 50th bday present but it got canceled due to Covid. I am taking another crack at it now. We are flying direct from NYC to CPT and have @ 2 weeks to play with.    Does this make sense for the first time?    -5 nights in Capetown (O&O or Blackheath?)  -3 Nights in Franschhoek (Leeu House?)  -4 nights in Sabi Sands (Arathusa or Jock Safari Lodge?)    Is that the best order to visit these places? Any other hotel recs? The original trip had 3 nights in Victoria Falls at the end then flying home from Johannesburg but that seems like it might be too much?

We will fly to JNB later this month. From JNB we will drive to Kruger NP for a few days then head to Central Drakensberg (Winterton) area. I have a few questions and hope to get some recommendations.    1 Where is a good place to stop and get cash from ATM machine on our way from JNB to Kruger NP? We will get some cash while still inside of airport just for initial need but think we can get better deal withdrawing money somewhere outside of airport. Similar question with sim card for cell phone should I buy sim card inside of airport or it's better to buy one from a store on our way to Kruger NP?    2 On our way driving from Kruger (Lower Sabi Camp) to Central Drakensberg it's going to be a long drive and we plan to leave early do it in one day. The question is where is a good and safe place to stop somewhere half way to go to restaurants for food break? Any recommendations?    Thanks in advance! ,WWZ,,
Trying to get an idea of costs for a family of 6. 2 adults 4 teens 15 and up. June 10-August 1 is our break. We would go for 14 days. Assuming food is about the same as California.  Looked to Airbnb and hotel for capetown and affordable- no problem. Maybe 4 nights. Like to see the mountain  penguins city. Rent a car and do the drive. 3 k for hotel.    Then safari- want a nice all inclusive type hotel with a guide. Cost? We want an authentic experience but with the comforts we are used to. Like to hike twin 14 year old boys like a bit of adventure. I saw a couple of hotels in Kruger but also don’t know what would be the best experience.    Victoria falls. Pricey 2 nights. Fly in sleep  see the falls sleep fly out. About 5 k for 3 rooms.    I don’t know what type of safari experience to add. I can book cape town and Victoria falls. We may add a night at Victoria falls to see that area better.    Your advice is much appreciated. ,LADarya,,Los Angeles...
We are coming out to Cape Town next year and I am in the process of booking flights and car. We want something like a Toyota Fortuner but note enormous price differentials between companies - with Avis its £1742 including extra insurance (for 13 days) with Budget its the same Hertz is £1550 Bluu is only £882 and Firefly is £1360 Alamo £1500 - others all in the £1450-£1500 range.    So on the face of it Bluu is the clear winner - but i see mixed to bad reviews from posters on here and in other places. But at the same time i see headline after headline saying avoid Avis avoid hertz avoid Firefly - so basically avoid everyone!!    We would take out all the insurances so should not suffer any xs issues and sneaky damage claims as they'd be covered by the insurances and I usually don't worry about filling up before return as its at worst going to be a few Rand more per litre if they fill up and we dont need to get into an argument over them squeezing a few litres in when i know i filled up!    Has anyone got any views on this generally or more specifically in the Cape Town area? We'd be pickup and drop off at the airport then doing another rental at Kruger later. ,TonyNSurrey,Cape Town Central,"Diss, United Kingdom"
Staying in Franschhoek in a couple of weeks. We want to visit one place specifically for MCC tasting.

Hi  I now have my map so things are a bit clearer regarding my onward route after Cape Town.  I'm staying in Green Point for 6 nts (booked)  My Robben Island trip is booked (my trip is in early Jan 2024)  Hire car will be delivered to me on last day in Cape Town so I can do a 1 day tour of Cape Peninsula.  Then I set off on the Garden Route for 25 days (solo female experienced traveller aged 67).  I want to get as far as Addo Elephant Park (probably avoiding Port Elizabeth as that looks like a big city....).  My flight home (to the UK) is from Cape Town & my last 2 nights will be near Stellenbosch (booked) so I can drop the hire car back at the airport.  I plan to do an electric bike tour of a vineyard at Stellenbosh & that will be enough of a wine visit for me.  I've got 23 days for this part of my trip.  I was planning to try to do a 'loop' by going along the Garden Route (N2) & then back on R62.  However R62 isn't looking very interesting to me.  I've watched lots of YouTube videos & there seems to be lots of beautiful scenery but I can't really see much to do - am I missing something?  Would I be best to do a round trip up/down to Oudshoorn from George (caves look good but not the ostrich farm...).  Other than that should I just keep to the Garden Route itself & just stagger my stops each way so that it doesn't feel as though I'm doubling back on the route totally?  I'm not totally sure about distances/travel times?  I don't think that it is a huge trip in total?? (I've done several 7 hr drives in a day in Namibia so I'm OK if I sometimes to do long drives).  I really need to pin my stops (& how many nights at each stop) so that I can start to book accommodations.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated as I've 'stalled'.  Thanks.

Hi all. I'm starting to think that with my wife's back problems going on group tours in Kruger etc. might be a bad idea because we'll have no control over where the vehicles go; meaning her back problems flare up when we travel on very bumpy roads and we wouldn't be able to say to the driver No don't go there. It seems like one could easily spend a lot of time in Kruger if one didn't have limitations but let's say we were to self-drive and stick to paved roads and relatively even dirt/gravel roads…what then would be the most time we'd want to spend there? Could one happily spend 5-7 days in Kruger sticking only to paved and good roads?    I have the same question about Hluhluwe although it seems the roads there might be worse. Traveling from the U.S. I'd like to spend a considerable amount of time in the parks and probably wouldn't make the trip if we'd be limited to a few days here a few days there.

Hi all.    I have flights booked for November and my wife is an Indian Passport Holder with a UK BRP.    I was banking on the online eVisa but have had no end of issues.

Has anyone not been repaid their deposit charged by Thrifty Car Rental? I have waited nine months have called Thrifty helpdesk twice and was told my query would be 'escalated for resolution'. Hertz the parent company of Thrifty responded to my query for deposit repayment; efforts to contact Thrifty are pointless so I contacted Hertz. A demand for $25 processing fee to research the Thrifty rental contract signed in Jan 2023 was made - suspect as I included a pdf copy of the exact contract with all the details. After I contacted BBB the Better Business Bureau contacted Hertz for clarity; Hertz told me I should approach Thrifty to have them instruct my bank to release these funds. Had Thrifty done this months ago I would not be engaging Hertz to assist in resolving this illegal retention of my deposit. Renters are at the mercy of Thrifty's franchisee's integrity regarding repayment of deposits owed. Hertz ended their correspondence with the hope I would be doing business with them in the future. The deposit request is for $250. Hertz net worth as at October 27 2023 is $2.6 Billion. This speaks volumes. ,Anton G,,

Hi we are a family of 4 travelling to SA for 2 weeks at the end of October/early November. We plan to stay 2 nights in Stellenbosch and would love some advice on which wineries to visit - for wine (prefer whites) scenery food and general ambience. Our daughters are early teens so probably not fine dining unfortunately but more good every day food in lovely surroundings - perhaps even a picnic if recommended?  I've read lots of different forums and know the list of possibilities is extensive so really just an idea of people's favourites or not to be misseds. We could call at 1-2 en route from CT on the first day but then would plan to ditch the car and uber it around on the second day. If there are any recommendations for wineries that also do other things that may keep the girls hapy too then that would be a bonus.

Hi everyone. I know there's been some talk about Gate 1's South Africa tours on this forum and reviews have been generally positive. My wife and I both in our 60s are considering a Gate 1 tour even though we've never been on any kind of group tour before. We're thinking about it because we like the idea of plans/transfers being laid out for us (we've always planned everything ourselves and are a little tired of it).    I'm looking at two tours. One is 12-day Classic South Africa starting at $1959.  https://www.gate1travel.com/africa/south-africa/2024/escorted/south-africa-tour-12dclaza24.aspx    The other is 18 day Kaleidoscope of South Africa starting at $2799  https://www.gate1travel.com/africa/south-africa/2024/escorted/south-africa-tour-12dclaza24.aspx    I like that the 18-day spends a lot more time in reserves etc. and I don't like that the 12-day spends only one day in Kruger. But I'm wondering if taking the 12-day and devoting the last five or six days to Botswana or somewhere else on our own might be a better use of our time.    Thank you for your help  Dave ,Davetroy,,"Plantation, Florida"
Does anyone know of any organised waterfall hikes around Cape Town? We don't have a car and not sure how good signal would be to organise uber/taxi back to Cape Town after would also be good to have a guide pointing out the way and anything of interest.    Thanks ,Ali M,Cape Town,
I am spending 3 nights in Cape Town Feb 24 then intend to hire a car for 2 weeks garden Route ending in Stellenbosch. I don’t need a car while in Cape Town but have found it difficult to get a car delivered to hotel. I also don’t really want to hire from the airport as I’ve heard there are a couple of unsafe areas around there and don’t want to inadvertently drive into a township ( I do tend to get lost) Is it feasible to wait until my last day in Cape Town to hire a car for 2 weeks ( preferably near V&A where I will be staying) or do I really need to book in advance?  Thanks ,ariel48,Cape Town,United Kingdom
Hi  I'm trying to sort out my hire car pick up/drop off.  I land at Cape Town airport & will get a taxi to my apartment at Green Point.  I'll spend 6 nights there & will mainly use Uber taxis to get around.  On my last day there I'll get my Avis hire car delivered to my apartment.  (The Avis depot is in Strand Street Downtown but I don't want to drive in the city area).  I can then spend the day driving to the Cape Peninsula etc.  I then have the hire car for another 25 days ending up in Stellenbosch (? probably 2 nights).  I need to get the hire car back to the airport for a 10 am drop off (my flight back to the UK is at 1845 hrs so I've allowed loads of time for any problems/hold ups & am happy to just 'hunker down' at the airport if I've got several hours to kill)  My question is:  How difficult are the roads around the airport?  I've looked on Google maps (which are a bit deceptive as the roads look very quiet).  The Avis depot is on the Airport Ring Road Matroosfontein 7490.  The reason that I'm anxious is because I've had a very bad experience of dropping a car off at Mexico City Airport - it didn't help that the staff wouldn't respond to my numerous requests for the exact location for the Waze navigation system on my mobile.  I think the experience has really knocked my confidence.  My accommodation in Stellenbosch will be too far away for Avis to collect the car.  I could do with some positive input please........  Thanks  Christine Bennett  (NB - I'm a solo female traveller - aged 67 so I have no-one to navigate) ,Christine B,Cape Town,Fordingbridge...

Hey. I’m travelling to South Africa with my wife and 2 kids (6 years and 9 years old) from 24th Dec to 5th Jan Landing in Johannesburg. We just made the plan and think we are short of time to plan for the specifics of the plan so  Wanted to ask what can be a good itinerary.  How many days to do the Safari at Kruger? Can someone refer a good company that manages the Safari? And can help with the bookings in the park.  What other activities can be done across that can be of interest for the kids?  Any other information can be helpful. ,Jahanzaib R,,"Karachi, Pakistan"
My wife and I are doing a 10 day Safari in Kenya and Tanzania in late September and want to extend or trip with a visit to Cape Town. I am looking for input on whether it is better to plan to do Cape Town on our own or to book a package (transfers hotel accommodations tours etc.) with a tour operator. We have traveled both ways in Europe in the past.    We are interested in visiting the highlights in the city of Cape Town including Table Mountain wineries the waterfront beaches and other top sights. Not so interested in museums.    Would consider booking day tours if we do it on our own.    Looking at probably staying for 5 nights but open to doing 7. ,Thomasjohnwhite,Cape Town,"Southport, North..."
Hello    My girlfriend and I will spend 4 days in Cape Town. We want to spend our last two days in Stellenbosch/ Franschhoek or both. We´d like to do a few tastings stay at an estate but also we will have a car and need to drive.    Just looking for tips about logistics and where to base ourselves considering we don´t want to drink drive and which of the two might be better etc.    So far my thinking is:    Day One: Drive from Capetown to Stellenbosch or Franschhoek. Do the tram or van tour.    Day Two: Have lunch at or near our accommodation - we hope to stay at an estate if anyone can suggest one? Then maybe visit another for a tasting in the other area before driving to the airport.    Accommodation we have seen includes:    Marianne Wine Estate  Alluvia Boutique Winery & Luxury Accommodation  Courchevel Cottages ,G H,Western Cape,"Barcelona, Spain"

Hi All    Be alert of the car rental scam under the name of http://greenmotioncarhire.co.za in south africa.    Last week when i try to book the car for 5 days rental one guy represented him from greenmotion car and van rentals and he sent me the company quotation and contract document from the domain @greenmotioncarhire.co.za and he asked me to pay the amount by EFT then i paid ZAR 2935 as i lost my cheque card in Capetown before last week and he said car will be delivered by 5pm to my address ( as i already sent all of my documents) but that cheater switched off his mobile number and even the emergency contact number which he mentioned in the contract. i lost my money and lost 3 valuable days as my wife's ticket is on Monday then same night i called to FNB bank fraud department and asked them to block my transaction but unfortunately he said that account is belongs to some personnel account and he already withdraw the money but still they freeze that account and next day morning i lodge the police complaint.  One more important thing is i verified the address mentioned in the invoice but there is nothing in that address in Pretoria and when i sent an email to green motion car hire head office to UK they are saying that they never received such requests and amount.    So please be aware that there is no company branch of greenmotion and it is a big scam and fraud please inform this to all tourists especially foreign tourists and recommend them to book the car from reputed companies and the companies who operate their offices from airport.    when he called he said his name is craig    Thanks & Regards  Mohammad Janimiya  +27612814538 ,MohammadJanimiya,Gauteng,"Johannesburg, South..."
Hi  I am a solo female traveller from the UK (well travelled) aged 67.  My trip is for 31 days.  I start in Cape Town & plan to stay somewhere in Green Point.  I have 6 nights before I pick up my hire car (which I will then have for the rest of my trip).  I'm not happy driving in big city areas & feel that using an Uber for local trips for the 1st few days would be better for me.  After I've exhausted the 'must see & do' things in/around /Cape Town I will use the hire car to continue on my trip .  In Cape Town my bucket list includes:  Table Mountain Tour  V & A Waterfront  Robben Island Trip  Township Tour  Museums & historic area  ?? Maybe a helicopter trip (depending on price.......)  IS 6 NIGHTS IN CAPE TOWN WITHOUT A CAR TOO LONG?  I'm happy to pull the collection date forward & hire the car for longer if necessary.  My onward route will include:  Cape of Good Hope  Bo Kaap  Simon's Town  Chapman's Peak Drive  Maybe 1 winery  Maybe Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens  & then along the Garden Route as far as Addo Elephant Park.  ALSO SHOULD I STAY PUT IN MY ACCOMMODATION IN GREEN POINT FOR THESE FIRST FEW PLACES OR 'MOVE ON'?  i'm struggling with maps/distances etc & have just ordered a map which should help...........

Hello a bit of a strange question    An old colleague of mine had a beautiful large dried seed pod on a stand that she bought from a gallery somewhere in SA many years ago. It looks like an oversized edamame pod and was at least half a meter long. The seeds rattled in the pod if you moved it. I'm currently in SA and was hoping to look for something similar as I've admired it for years.    Does anyone have any advice on what seed it might have been and where I should look? I've tried googling with no luck.    Thanks in advance ,heather n,Cape Town,"Hertford, United..."

Hi we will be in Cape Town this weekend for 5 days. Whilst shopping is the last thing on my and my husband's mind we are travelling with 2 teenage girls who no doubt will want a couple of hours wizzing around a shopping mall at some stage.  It will be high street fashion shops that they are interested in rather than high end boutiques or designer brands. Firstly are there any recommendations for a mall and secondly are there any well known local brands/shops that we should particularly look out for that do affordable teenage fashion?  We are staying in Green Point and will have a car.  Thanks in advance. ,Patricia O,Cape Town,"Belfast, United..."
Just completed a 19-day journey and returned home.    We started on Kruger National Park which was a wonderful trip. Then we took a flight to Port Elizabeth and began our journey along Garden Route.    On the first day in Port Elizabeth we parked our car at the public parking at Shark Rock Pier. When we parked the car a person wearing a vest approached us and asked if we needed car guarding services. We declined.    About an hour later we were getting to leave and had just sat in the car the same person approached us again. We still did not tip him. As soon as the vest-wearing individual left a man in a suit came over and claimed to be the parking attendant. He even showed us his work ID hanging from his neck and said that he needed to collect a parking fee of ZAR29.  Since we had only been to Kruger National Park before and this was our first time in a city we were unfamiliar with the parking fee rule in South Africa (as our country has one).  So we swiped our card. After swiping the card I received a notification on my app that ZAR29999 had been charged!    However at that point the man had already disappeared and we couldn't find him when we got out of the car. We even asked the vest-wearing individuals but they claimed they hadn't seen anyone.    In fact we strongly suspect they were working together. As mentioned earlier as soon as we refused to tip the scammer appeared. The vest-wearing personnel claimed they hadn't seen the man.    To make matters worse we then proceeded to Addo. When we arrived at Addo we discovered that our front tire had gone flat and we had no idea when it happened. This car was rented just the last night at the airport. We also believe this is connected to the previous incident.  Luckily we made it to Addo safely before we noticed.      We are currently working with the bank to resolve this issue.  When it comes to travel safety in South Africa we had always been more concerned about violent crimes like robberies which led us to completely overlook the presence of scammers.  Hope to leave a record for who plan to travel to South Africa – don't let down your guard as we were. ,Fan,,Xinyi District...

My wife and I are visiting Cape Town and Franschhoek at the end of the month. We love our food trying new places experiencing new foods. We have got more gourmet restaurants booked up such as Belly of the Beast la Colombe and Oku. However we have two more nights at each location that we want to get booked up.  Can anyone recommend some places that may be slighter lighter options and/or more rustic local cusine that we we should not miss out on? Any light bite locations for lunch would also be welcome.

hi in our 60s first time to South Africa coming up in March of 2024. First newbie mistake: I booked everything already before I thought of this forum! But I'd still appreciate input as I can alter some things if it looks like I'm doing something dumb... Anyways our current itinerary:    - Long-haul flight from North America arrives Cape Town 8 a.m.  - 4 nights Cape Town staying in Sea Point area.  - 1 night Hermanus.  - 1 night Franschhoek (don't care a lot about wine just want to see the area)  - 1 night Oudtshoorn (to break up R62 route and see the caves)  - 2 nights Plett Bay to relax  - 2 nights Eastern Cape safari (lalebela)  - Fly from Port Elizabeth to Kruger  - 3 nights Kruger at Motswari  - Fly home from Johannesburg    Questions:    1. Anything nuts about this basic plan (keeping in mind it's all booked I only want to make changes if there's a sort of compelling reason...sorry my own fault I know)    2. Does it make sense to pick up the car at the Airport? Two things: by the time the plane lands deplanes we've got the bags gone through customs picked up the car chances are it's 9:30 or 10 a.m. anyways so we should miss most of the rush hour? and two: safety? I see a bunch of posts from someone who looks to be very knowledgeable posting about the route from the airport into town being very sketchy right down to trying to figure out ways to avoid stopping at red lights and such...overkill? PS I know we'll just have arrived long-haul flight but we have lie-down seats so hopefully not too draining...    3. Of course it would be nice to just get uber or transfer from the airport but even if we do that we'll be arriving at the hotel way too early to check in and we'd just have to go out again a bit later just to waste time getting the car in town? Or have car company drop off at the hotel but then could be another time waster if anything's wrong with the car? I guess I'm sort of inclined to get the car right away then we can drop our bag off at the hotel and go somewhere for a nice lunch maybe drive down just to Camps Bay.    4. Just intuitively I couldn't care less about seeing V&A but is this a mistake?    5. Once we're done with Cape Town the basic plan is to do Hermanus and Franschhoek and then do the R62 route to Oudtshoorn then down to Geoorge and then along the coast to Plett Bay etc. Is it relatively easy and sensible to see both Hermanus and Franschhoek in the way I've got it set out now (1 night in each place before heading out on R62)? Or avoid one and so avoid driving back & forth?    6. For the drive from Cape Town to Hermanus does it make sense to go the 2 until Somerset West and then work our way down the R44 so we can do the coastal drive from Gordon's Bay Stony Point Betty's bay up to Arabella and then down R43 to Hermanus or does this take us through sketchy territory? And then what's the best route up to Franschhoek the next day?    7. Should we have booked it the other way around for some reason ie. Franschhoek first then Hermanus then back up to R62 route?    8. Looking at using Aroundaboutcars as it seems quite a bit cheaper. And Google Maps for navigation. Any thoughts?    9. I have some mobility restrictions. The Table Mountain lineup situation is noted. Say we can't go first thing in the morning for whatever reason (wheather) - the Table Mountain website specifies a skip-the-queue fast-track ticket (used to be just for the 2 busiest months but has been extended). Has anyone used these recently & do you know if these tickets just get you past the ticketing line up or also the gondola line-up?

I've read a lot of posts and consulted the San parks drive time.pdf and a little lost! (Not a good start!)    I want to self drive adding in a night drive or day hike if possible. I have booked flights up from port Elizabeth where we will have spent 3 days self drive at addo up to Joburg spending a night airport hotel as arrival 8pm before a very early flight to Kruger. I have return flights and a car booked.    Collect car 8am Tuesday    Return car and check on Sunday 11 am back to joberg and international flight home.    So all day Tues - sat really.    I want to maximisey time. It will be on February.    Q - should we try and include a day maybe the Tuesday doing the panorama route? Is it worth sacrificing a day in Kruger?!    Q - should we split our time between camps or stick to one or two? I wondered if going south to central for example would be good so stick to a patch?    Q - Camps that have caughty eye are letaba lower sabie berg en dal and talamati would 4 be too many    Q - I'd love to see wild dogs Should we aim for camps which may have better opportunities for the wildlife we want to see.    Q - is it possible to squeeze in an early morning self drive en route to the airport?!    I know there are.lots of you put there who are very familiar with what's possible and drive times so I would really welcome some suggestions!

Hi    Myself and my partner are looking at staying in CT for 4/5 nights at the end of our holiday in March.  We ideally want self catering so we can cook but I’m aware loadshedding is a big problem so trying to find somewhere where they have a generator etc. Was thinking maybe finding a self catering apartment in a hotel may combat this problem as maybe more likely to have generators etc.    Does anyone have any recommendations? Ideally looking for up to £120 a night as close to the Waterfront as possible and has a generator. I’ve emailed a few places but they aren’t very good at getting back to me!

Apologies if this sounds too basic but the info online is very confusing as I am just starting out.    Thanks in advance  Shirley ,Travel B,Kruger National Park,"Kuwait City, Kuwait"

Hello    I am at the early stages of looking to come in Feb/ March next year (aka trying to figure out feasibility and rough budget). Would an itinerary a little like this work:    5 days in Cape Town  10 days to see Kruger (self-drive and 3/4 nights) Mozambique beaches (3/4 nights) extra time to travel between with stops on the way.    Just wondering if anyone could give a very rough guide on what to expect to pay in Kruger. We would be happy in accommodation on the cheaper side of things and would mainly self-drive but probably want 1 sunrise game drive and 1 sunset night drive.    Is Mozambique feasible or better to do it on a separate trip?    Thanks ,G H,Kruger National Park,"Barcelona, Spain"

Hi! First time flyer here and i have a flight from OR Tambo to Nashville but it transits through Cape Town and then Atlanta. I intend to only take a carry on since i will be meeting friends over there who will have most of the necessities already. how long Will it take me to get from domestic arrivals to international departures and how would seat selection work if any? Also Is it possible to check in online for this or would i need to do physical check in? Thank you in advance ,Charlene576,Cape Town,"Heidelberg, South..."
This topic was closed a good while ago generally after poor comments. I just wanted to say that we received our giraffe from 'Old Art from Africa' today in perfect condition. It had been well wrapped. We bought it last September it was shipped towards the end of October. The company whatsapped us with a photo of the shipping details.  The moral is -  Be patient you should get it eventually even if it is much longer than the estimated period which they give. ,david b,Stellenbosch,U.K.

Travelling with two children under 4. Flying from Joburg to Port Elizabeth self driving to Cape Town flying to Kruger and back to Joburg to self drive Pilanesberg NP. We have just under 5 weeks.  Are there any areas of concern with regard to driving through particular townships?  I was also considering a short trip to Namibia or would we be best to stick to our current itinerary?  Thank you!!! ,Tim L,,
I’m going to reword a previous post I made. There is so much info out there that I’m trying to narrow it down and hoping to get some help/advice.    I have 2 time share certificates to use so I have booked 2 weeks in Hazyview. One week at Kruger Gate Lodge and the other at Sanbonani. My thoughts were to fly from JNB to Mpumalanga Airport and rent a car to get myself around and to be able to do some self driving in KNP. I’m also considering hiring a guide for a week and booking a safari or two within the park. A sunset and a sunrise. This will be my first time in SA. Recommendations for guides/tour operators (both inside and outside the park) other must-see things in the area thoughts on Hazyview and the area best resource for planning a self-drive. I’m thinking a Wild Card would be a good investment as well. Any info would be much appreciated!! Excited but also a little nervous and overwhelmed! Trip is planned from March 15-29th. I know this is rainy season but those were the only dates available. I did Thailand for 3 weeks in monsoon season one year and still had a great time! ,Annette S,Kruger National Park,"Creston, Canada"

Hello    We are planning a 3-week road trip in South Africa during late January/early February of next year. We are flying into and out of Cape Town. The trip will be combination of the Kgalagadi and the Western Cape. For the Western Cape portion we want to prioritize being near the water (beaches lakes rivers) with opportunities for swimming and hiking. While we prefer to stay in quieter nature reserves over big cities it would be nice to have access to nice restaurants during the Western Cape portion of our itinerary since we will be self-catering during our time in the Kgalagadi.    During our prior trips to South Africa we have stayed in Cape Town and Franschhoek. During a prior trip in May we drove from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town with overnights at Addo Stormsriver Mouth Wilderness Ebb and Flow and Agulhas – staying exclusively in SanParks accommodations. We enjoyed that trip very much but I suppose we are curious about experiencing something new.    Here is our planned itinerary:    Day 1: Cape Town  Day 2: Cederberg (Algeria Cottage Cape Nature)  Day 3: Augrabies Falls National Park  Day 4-13: Kgalagadi Frontier Park  Day 14: Karoo National Park  Day 15: Goukamma Reserve (Blacktail Chalet)  Day 16: Goukamma Reserve  Day 17: Keurbooms River Nature Reserve (Whisky Cabin Canoe Trail)  Day 18: Keurbooms River Nature Reserve  Day 19: Plettenberg Bay (apartment near Roberg 5 beach)  Day 20: Plettenberg Bay  Day 21: Kogelberg Nature Reserve (Mbali Eco cabin)  Day 22: Kogelberg Nature Reserve  Day 23: Cape Town or Winelands?  Day 24: Fly home    1. We wanted to return to the Garden Route during the summer to experience better weather than we did in May. What do you think about our choice of locations along on the Garden Route? Would you consider other places that we have overlooked? We were also considering the Sanparks chalet at Nature’s Valley and I suppose we wouldn’t mind revisiting Stormsriver since we would be experiencing it in a different season.    2. Our itinerary is heavy on Cape Nature reserves. How do their chalets compare to Sanparks chalets? During our last trip we found that the quality of the Sanparks chalets to be uneven with some units in dire need of maintenance and renovations (the ones we stayed at Stormsriver come to mind). What is the quality of lodging /experiences like at the Cape Nature reserves? If you have recommendations for particular cabins/units at these reserves (or at different reserves) we would welcome them.    We would value your thoughts on any portion of our itinerary. Thank you in advance for your thoughts. ,4quartets,,United States
We arrive in CT in early Feb 2024 from cruise will have already been to PE and done safari. We have 14 days in total before flying back to Uk from CT.  Suggestions please  We plan 4 days CT maybe with day trip out to Paternosta in these 4 days then 10 days to do Garden Route east via winelands then to Hermanus/Kynsna/Plettenburg and Natures Valley.  Is it worth diverting to Oudshoorn ?  Then back to CT for flight home.  Is this feasible and how long should we spend in each?  Would appreciate all advice and suggestions  Thanks ,Sara E,Garden Route,

Hello    We are planning our next Safari and we are absolutely Wildlife focussed.    What we don’t like or what we don’t have to have:  Pur Luxus cars queuing up at an animal zoo feeling small reserve    What we like to have:  As intimate as possible encounters (best alone with the animal(s)) for hours animals in or around the camp possibility of night drives and off-road (in case off)    So we are searching for something comparable to the Okavango Delta private Reserves    It’s all about the wildlife and the possibility to see them in THEIR habitat and we watch them as guests.    all your recommendations are welcome.    Thx ,Martin Pitschek,,"Munich, Germany"

Hello Everyone    It seems clear that there are many options for wine estates. I am most interested in white wines however. In particular Chardonnay Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc stand out as favorites. Where should I go to experience these? Furthermore do many of these vineyards remain open on Sundays?

Greetings next April I will be traveling from the States to South Africa and Mozambique for a two week trip mostly involving a Safari at Sabi Sands and scuba diving and beach in Bazaruto.    I'm flying into Cape Town. We arrive around 15:00 on first day after many hours of travel. We're lodging in Central Business District (Labotessa Hotel). I'm planning to just grab a bite to eat and rest at hotel upon arrival. But we are staying in Cape Town the next day before flying to Kruger area. Question: what do you recommend for a relaxing full day in Cape Town? We'll likely sleep in and grab breakfast at hotel. We would be ok with visiting one museum. Not interested in hiking or traversing to top of Table Mountain. Not interested in the island which imprisoned Nelson Mandela either. Your recommendations are appreciated.    Thank in advance for you help. ,Emirel,Cape Town,"Austin, Texas"
Hi all  we are planning a trip for 3 weeks this December flying in to Cape Town - flying out from Johannesburg. We are travelling with two kids - 7 and 9 years old.  The plan was to spend:  • 5 nights in Cape Town  • 3 nights around Stellenbosch/Franschhoek  • 8 nights through the Garden route to port Elizabeth  maybe add a safari around Amakhala  • Fly to Johannesburg  • 6 nights safari in Pilanesberg  • 1 night in Johannesburg before flying back.    Talking to friends they suggested we add Durban and cut it shorter in Cape Town and garden route.  Any suggestions for first time travelers to South Africa? Does the original plan sounds reasonable? We love the beach but the main attraction for this trip will definitely be the big 5s . Also is Pilanesberg good to spot big cats as we have a big fan of lions in the family? I would definitely like to avoid any malaria areas.  Thanks a lot in advance for any suggestions ,A J,,

Hello everyone  sorry if the question have been asked again. I have read a lot of posts in the forum but I am still confused. We are a couple but we don't have a very good budget. Around 22000 R per person. I was thinking to book a 5 day or 4 day tour with wild wings or moafrika tours. And then I saw for example that there is a hotel like Kruger Gate hotel that you can book cheaper accomodation in a better room and then book tours etc. What do you propose? Also how can I find good and safe tour operator? Is there an official link or list? Any information or proposals for tour guides etc will be appreciated! We thought that it would be better to not drive by ourselves but have someone to guide as etc.  Thank you for your time! ,giannis chtz,Kruger National Park,"Paris, France"

Hi we will be driving from Green Point to Stellenbosch on a Tuesday morning. We are staying in Stellenbosch itself. Looking at different forums I've noticed a couple of routes that have been suggested as the safest avoiding the R310. The first is using the N1 & R304 at Joostenberg and the second was continuing on the N2 to Firgrove Rural and then taking the R44. We plan to stop at a wine farm or 2 en route and once we plan the best and safest driving route then I'll plan the wine stops accordingly. Is there any preference between these 2 routes?

I'm an American female and my older brother lives in Johannesberg. He'll be leaving on March 1st so I plan to visit him go on safari and see some sights. It's basically a milestone birthday present to myself.) I may be solo or I may be with a friend.  Anyway after researching online and asking friends I think I'd like to spend 5 nights total on safari doing game drives etc. I'd like to split it up 2 nights KNP/3 private reserve or vice versa.  For the KNP portion I'm thinking Unhaba Eco Lodge or Tremisana. For private reserves I'm considering Umkumbe Safari Lodge or Elephant Plains Safari Lodge (Sabi Sands)  Umlani Bush Camp (Timabavati) Baobob Ridge (Klaserie) or Greenfire Game Lodge (Balule).  How would you split this up and where would you stay given the above choices? ,mooth,Kruger National Park,"Raleigh, North..."

Hi everyone!  I'm travelling to Greater Kruger in September 2024 from Australia before heading to Kenya.  I have travelled to Kruger NP in the past but never to a private reserve.  I currently have a budget of approx. 40000-45000 ZAR for this portion of the trip and have narrowed it down to 2 options:    Option 1:  - 4n Timbavati (21500ZAR) @ Shindzela  - 3n Klaserie (17000ZAR)@ nThambo  Total of ~38500ZAR not including transfers    Option 2:  -4n Sabi Sands (39980ZAR) @ Nottens - not including transfers    Which would you recommend? 7 nights in Timbavati+Klaserie or the 4nights in Sabi?  Do I take the 8 game drive in Sabi or 14 game drives with the other option?    I'm a photographer and mainly am interested in big cats and predators.  I don't care about luxuriousness of the lodges just want to know which option will give me better photographic opportunities in the end!

Good morning    I will be travelling from the UK to South Africa in March with my 11 Yr old son. My understanding is that we do not require visas (10 day stay) and that I don't require a birth certificate or signed affidavit for my son when he's travelling with me.    Has anyone been recently and can confirm? I don't want any issues either end and at the moment I have time to arrange anything additional we'll need. There is no court order etc in place but persuading my ex to do the admin of a signed order will take a while!    Thanks ,Lesley w,,

Hi All    as a family of 4 we will be in Kruger for 5 nights in August24. I kindly ask your help in suggesting me the best way to split our nights in regards to camps and distances.    This is my idea.  Day 1 From Blyde Canyon to Letaba  Day 2 Letaba  Day 3 Move south. Where? Lower Sabie/Berg en Dal?  Day 4 same as before  Day 5 same as before  Day 6 Kruger to Joburg    Questions  - Can we get from Letaba to one of the central/southern parks in one day of self drive or it is too long?  - Does it make more sense to split 5 nights into 3 camps because of the distance or 2 is better because we don't have to move around too much.    In terms of camp we need a restaurant and gas station and we prefer quieter places where we can enjoy nature more and do smaller game drives.  Thanks a million for your help!!

We're a family of four (children ages 7 and 9) from New Zealand just back from a 3.5 week trip to South Africa. We had a wonderful time and wanted to give a report in case it's useful for anyone.    First on safety we had no issues at all and never felt threatened. Some basic precautions may have helped - we avoided Jo'burg altogether (except the airport) didn't drive at night and took cameras and wallets with us but kept them close. In towns there are often beggars at traffic lights but none bothered us and with a polite shake of the head they moved on. We had no car break-in attempts and the attendants at street parking and parking lots were friendly and happy with a tip of 2-5 rand. We had heard about tourists being targeted in the centre of Mthatha so stayed at an Airbnb on the edge of town and the next morning drove a route around the centre instead of through it with no problems.    On infrastructure I'm sure load shedding is a nightmare for businesses but for us tourists out and about seeing things it barely affected us at all. We came across a few traffic lights out of action and treated them like 4-way stops. Most roads in the Western Cape and all the N national highways are in good condition. The N2 that we took across the country is as good as anything in New Zealand. We drank tap water in the Western Cape with no issues and mostly bottled water elsewhere. In fact if you happened to be looking the other way when passing a shanty town in the Western Cape you could take it for any first-world country. The non-national roads in Eastern Cape and KwaZulo-Natal have more pot-holes but nothing to write home about about except for Makhanda where the roads are a disgrace. We had heard about animals on the road in the former Transkei but there were far too many vehicles on the road when we passed through for any wandering animal to live long. All across the country there were plentiful and good quality accommodations cafes and petrol stations. Eating out prices were about two-third of what you'd pay in New Zealand.    Our itinerary was Cape Town -> Franschhoek -> Oudtshoorn -> Knysna -> Tsitsikamma -> Gqeberha -> Addo Elephant National Park -> Makhanda -> Mthatha -> Underberg -> Giants Castle -> Cathedral Peak -> Pietermaritzburg -> Durban. It was over 2500km overall and to be honest was a bit too much for the time available. We should probably have finished in Gqeberha after Addo and had a more relaxed holiday. We had a great time in the Drakensberg to Durban section but it deserved more time.    Cape Town was superb even if the weather didn't play ball and we didn't get to hike up Table Mountain. We enjoyed visiting Bo Kaap Langa township (very friendly with a local guide) the V&A waterfront Groot Constantia Kalk Bay and the Chapmans Peak drive. The wine region around Franschhoek is just beautiful the Klein Karoo worth seeing and the kids enjoyed meeting ostriches and cheetas in Oudtshoorn. Knysna is nice if maybe not especially memorable. Addo on the other hand was a highlight - seeing so many of the big African animals and having a wild elephant come right past us out of the bush on a game drive. We stayed in a San Parks chalet at Addo (main camp) Tsitsikamma (lovely wild coast - walk to the waterfall) and Giants Castle and all of them were pleasant stays. Our one bit of drama on the trip was leaving Giants Castle where a protest by people who hadn't been paid blocked the road and we had to spent an extra night in the national park (nice spot to be stuck though). Our imaginations ran wild about what this protest might be like but next morning when one police car and a fire crew opened the road it was distinctly low key with the 3-5 protesters lying on the grassy verge as we drove past. The Drakensberg is spectacular and it was a shame that rain stopped us getting up Sani Pass to Lesotho.    From cities to semi-desert to beaches to mountains we certainly had plenty of variety on our trip. All together we had a fabulous time in South Africa and would very much like to go back spend a bit more time in some of the places we didn't do justice and visit a few new parts of the country. ,cunningdavid,,"Wellington, New..."

Hi from what I can see on Google the R536 between Hazyview and Sabie seem to be closed permanently. Is that correct? If so I guess it means one should stay in accomodations near Graskop instead of nicer options in Hazyview when wanting a base to explore the Panorama route right?    Also I'd like to know what is the safest and easiest (not the most scenic) drive from the Graskop/Sabie-area down to Jo'burg - which roads to choose and which to avoid. And if possible where the good rest stops are located.    I'll be going in November as a single mom with three teens :-)    Thanks in advance! ,Jane,,"Odense, Denmark"

Hi all    My Dad and I are planning a trip to the Greater Kruger this summer and have narrowed it down to spending 3 nights in the Sabi Sands (Arathusa) and 3 nights in the Timbavati.

We are travelling in late August and would love the opportunity to see wild dogs - though know there's a lot of luck involved. We've been on several safaris before and are more interesting in good game viewing & guiding over the facilities at the lodge.    Any advice?

Hi single mom from Denmark here (40) will be travelling to SA alone with my three kids (10 13 15) in November. Have some questions about driving safety and so on.    The first 7 days are planned with a private driver / volunteer work with primaters and a stay in KNP.    Then we have 6 days left where we will be based around Hoedspruit most likely at two different lodges rekax and see some things before making our way back to Jo’burg and flying home.    I have a hard time deciding if I should rent a car and self-drive around Hoedspruit Panorama Route back to Jo’burg etc. or if I should rely on a driver / tour operator for those last 6 days.    I’m a good driver and used to long stretches in Europe but I am conpletely new to left-driving and I have concerns about poor GPS-signals safety etc.    Can you help me weigh in pro’s and con’s for self-drive vs tourguides/private driver for sight seeing?    And what is the best route from Hoedspruit to Jo’burg? ,Jane,,"Odense, Denmark"
33M Indian guy here. Planning a solo trip over my birthday at the end of May and had a few queries:    1. Is the eVisa system running more smoothly now? The delay complaints that I've come across seem to have dried up by the end of 2022 but thought I'd check anyway. Also how long have people taken to receive their eVisas currently?    2. Is a flight reservation acceptable instead of an all-out flight booking? Are online portals like Flight Itinerary For Visa trustworthy for this? I don't fancy blocking my credit card for a refundable ticket just yet but will think otherwise if there's a lot of advice against.    3. I was planning to fly into JNB do a quick spot of local sightseeing (maybe a Soweto guided tour) and then head to Kruger area for 3 nights for some safaris as well as a day tour on the Panorama Route. I'd then like to fly down to Cape Town and spend 4-5 nights in the region mostly visiting the coast as well as the wine regions. I may just end up heading back to JNB since the flight prices are a lot cheaper from there as compared to CPT. Does this sound like a decent itinerary for a 10-11 day solo trip? My interests are in photography history and culture primarily but I also don't want to miss out on the African safari experience.    4. Any hacks for a solo person on a safari at Kruger? I'm a mid-range spender but Kruger looks like an expensive place. ,prayashgiria,,"New Delhi, India"

Hello we are a couple visiting South Africa for the first time. We started in Johannesburg and today we arrived in Nelspruit. We travel without a rental car and only by public transport. That's why we are now looking for a suitable tour provider for Kruger NP. We are interested in half-day tours or full-day tours without an overnight stay in the park. Now I can find a lot of providers online but often without reviews. The biggest problem for us is that the tours which start early in the morning often only start from certain collection points. Unfortunately there is no Uber here and the collection points are often far away.  We are also interested in a tour to the Blyde River Canyon. We wouldn't be averse to a day trip to Eswatini either. Maybe someone knows a provider with a wide range of offers so that we might be able to get a discount if we book 2x Kruger NP and a Blyde River Canyon tour?  Thank you in advance for all the information!    PS: If there is something else to discover around here even if it is in the shadow of the tours mentioned above please bring it on. ,René P,,"Cottbus, Germany"
Hi my husband and daughter are in Cape Town fie a week at tge beginning of December. What would be the best area for them to stay in to make day trips out to Simonstown or Stellenbosch easy?

Hi all I'm travelling to Cape Town from Knysna in March with my 11 Yr old son I am a woman. What is the safest route into Cape Town from the Garden Route? Are we better getting on to the N1 at Swellendam or will we be safe coming in on the N2?    We'll leave Knysna around 6am I think so it will be daytime when we get to Cape Town.    Also is it a safe drive from the Waterfront to the airport? Again in daylight hours. We are staying in an apartment on the waterfront so hopefully that's safe.    Thanks! ,Lesley w,Cape Town,
Hello all    I'd really appreciate your advice on how safe it is / safety aspects of renting a campervan to do the Garden Route - my partner and I plan to drive from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth in early December.    We've read up quite a bit and seen some contrasting views (this woman seems to think it definitely isn't a good idea https://www.quora.com/Is-it-safe-to-travel-around-Africa-in-a-camper-van ) while others say it should be fine. We'd be staying in National Park campsites only travelling during the day keeping valuables hidden not pick up hitch hikers get fuel as often as we can etc. We'd rent a campervan rather than 4x4 probably from somewhere like Maui or Bobo - although I'd worry that the branding on the side would scream 'tourist'!    Any thoughts are very welcome. If it feels too unsafe then we'd get a car and stay in B&Bs instead.    Thank you! ,E M,Garden Route,

I will be in Cape Town for a full week this coming October. I will be joining a tour group and half of my stay has already been booked in a boutique hotel in de Waterkant. So I’m considering staying in a different area for the other days on my own in order to experience a different neighborhood. After some research I think I’ve narrowed it down to either Green Point or Gardens.    A bit more background: I’m a solo gay male traveler in my 40’s. I will not have a car so plan to Uber around but would still prefer an area that is at least somewhat walkable to grab a bite or get a low key drink (pub/laid back bar as opposed to a club).    Would appreciate thoughts on Green Point and Gardens or even de Waterkant.    Thanks! ,teutonicplague,Cape Town Central,San Diego...

I would prefer a smaller and more personal place and a chance to see something local as this will be our only time in Johannesburg but I don't want to spend time in transit if not worth it.

After much research we engaged Hank as our tour guide in Cape Town. We were a party of 2 women on a mother/daughter trip. Hank was professional friendly very well informed knowledgeable regarding SA history willing to share his stories and own personal views on SA and the history made sure we were safe always on time flexible and able to adjust routes quickly...we were there for the huge storm that blew through on September 24th. Hank was with us for our 5 nights in Cape Town then drove us to Grootbos and came back to pick us up there 2 nights later. By the time he dropped us at the airport we felt like he was family. We paid Hank daily in cash a previously agreed upon amount. I highly recommend Hank for your tour guide needs. He will be able to assist you in building your trip and can also help with any special details you might need. Thank you Hank!!! ,aedrbf,,West Hartford...

Are they walking distance?  And is Oldenburg close by too?  Any recommendations very welcome for other vineyards. We would like a picturesque place with some atmosphere.  Later in our stay we are going to Franschhoek and taking the Orange tram.  Thanks in advance ,elaineDevon,Stellenbosch,devon
Hello forum planning a day trip from CT late in November anyone know the status of the wine tram ? Looking at the website it seems tracks were badly damaged and replaced by bus.

Hello    We are considering doing a private day trip in January and I am hoping that you all might be able to help me with an itinerary that works for us please. I have looked at the tours on here but they are all heavily wine tasting orientated which doesn’t work for us.    We would like to see the gorgeous scenery have time in the towns to mooch around the shops and have a gorgeous lunch somewhere outside with a stunning view probably a wine estate. We want to do the road pass over the mountain too if possible. Also anything else you think we should do or see please.    I have limited mobility. I can walk but only in short bursts so shops work but a proper walk is out of the question.    Thanks so much for your help. ,Suzanne C,Cape Town,"Suffolk, United..."
Hello everybody!    Our itinerary is almost ready but a final question before we book the last lodge.  We first go 5 night to KNP after that 3 nights to Honeyguide in Manyeleti.  Now we have 4 more nights after this. Our plan was to go to Shindzela but I'm having some doubts about the amount of nights.    I know 2 nights can feel a bit rushed and 3 would be better. But the question is now is 4 nights a little to long for Shindzela? Online I've read about it having a little smaller traverse area.  The other option would be 2 nights Shindzela en maybe 2 nights in the Klaserie (nthambo?).    What would you all recommend?  Thank you in advance! ,Kido O,Kruger National Park,
Hi    I've shortlisted 4 hotels which is on the V&A area which are within my budget but am unsure how safe and easy it is to walk to the waterfront particularly to the HOHO bus station.    Appreciate if anyone can advise if I can walk alone (especially at night maybe after dinner) back to the hotel:    1) Sugar Hotel  2) Protea by Marriott  3) The Commodore  4) The Portwood    If there's any other hotels that provided shuttle (paid or free) to the waterfront area that would be good too as I would prefer not to uber since I will be travelling alone.

We have a (it was a dream but now I feel a nightmare) trip to S.A at the end of September and I am getting very anxious and worried about it. Even more so after coming across the thread What do you wish you'd known before going to S.A on here.  I am worried about safety....at least 3 people I know who have been/lived there are amazed we are going....they have all said it is dangerous. One lady I know said it was an amazing country and they have been 4 times but wouldn't dream of going again as they feel it's too dangerous now....car jacking lack of lights due to power outages making it even more dangerous. She said Cape town was getting like Johannesburg...which I knew had a bad reputation for safety. Said that although robbery was always a problem now they shoot first and rob afterwards !    I am almost hysterical with worry and have now read that there could be violence in the next month or so due to strikes (mini bus/taxis)    Can anyone advise me? ,jec5,,

Hi husband and wife (in 50's) staying in Cape Town for 3 nights and then driving to Port Elizabeth (over 7 nights) at end of March 2024. Already have 2 night safari booked near PE and last night booked at PE for early flight. Therefore have 4 nights left to get from CT to safari.

Stay 2 nights at Mossel Bay and then 2 nights at Knysna or Plettenberg Bay (doing day trips up to Oudtshoorn Wilderness etc).  Question - is the 1st day way too much driving (we are used to driving long distances) road conditions etc or should we stay overnight at Swellendam and then go to Mossel Bay via Oudtshoorn or Albertinia? ,Damo,Garden Route,"Newcastle, Australia"

Hi we’re heading to SA on honeymoon in November and planning our routes between stops for our two big drives. (We’ve booked accommodation so not looking to add in any more stays)    For Hermanus to Oudtshoorn I’m currently thinking it’ll be around 5 hours looking at going via Swellendam and Ladismith and stopping off in both places for a quick snack/stretch legs. Is this a good route to take and does 5 hours sound about right?    After Oudtshoorn we head to Plettenburg. We’re planning to go to Cango caves that morning for 9am and can’t decide between going the most direct way which I think will be around 3/4 hours or driving over the Sawrtberg to Prince Albert and coming back round Meringspoort which I think will be more like 5/6 hours with stops.    Any thoughts would be very welcome and any roads/areas/diversions we should try to avoid? Thanks :) ,Sarah R,,Manchester

As per title I'm trying to compare how long it would take me to drive from Malelane to Croc Bridge.    I see on Google Maps it's about 40 min - 1 hr give or take on the N4. A bit of a frustrating exercise trying to work this out on the route inside Kruger as Google Maps keeps shifting the route back to the N4 but from what I've gathered from playing around with the route point set driving inside Kruger from Malelane gate to Croc Bridge camp would be about 2 hours ?    I see from the Kruger guide I downloaded from SANParks though that the travel time seems a lot longer from this gate to the camp about 5 hrs 40 minutes?    Which is correct? ,Warren L,Kruger National Park,

Hello everyone  I'll be visiting Franschhoek in a about 3 weeks time (first trip to SA....very excited).  After some time in CT we will be driving to Hermanus and then after Hermanus to Franschhoek via the Cape Canopy Zip Wire tour.  When planning the holiday I had fully expected to then drive from the Canopy tour to Franschhoek but by looking at Google maps it seems the most obvious route there is closed due to the recent floods and landslides (hope everyone is ok btw!)  What route would locals suggest instead...would I have to double back on myself and go via Stellenbosch instead ?    Or could the road be open again in 3 weeks?    Also how is the clean up going...whilst I'd like to support local businesses by visiting Franschhoek this is a holiday for me so should I consider scrapping a few days in Franschhoek and going somewhere that was less effected by the floods?    Thanks in advance ,Daniel F,Franschhoek,

In the early planning stage. We are trying to decide between Bateleur Senalala and Motswari. All are within budget for a 3-4 night stay. Open to other ideas.  We like the idea of some walking and being able to view animals at a water hole or riverbed during the down time.

Hello    we (me+my girlfriend) are planning a roadtrip to South Africa. Firstly we will spend 5 nigths in Cape Town exploring the city and its surroundings. Then we will move to Franschhoek for 2 nights to try some wine tastings from Franschhoek we will go to Hermanus for 2 nigths for whale watching and some hiking and then we will come back to Cape Town airport and fly to Joburg.    My questions is is it better to do the triangle Cape Town => Franschhoek => Cape Town by a rented car or is it worth to use Uber? I see that from the price perspective taking three Uber drives from Cape Town to Franschhoek from Franschhoek to Hermanus and from Hermanus to Cape Town is comparable to four days of car rental. But I do not know how is it with the reliability of Uber drives from such a remote location like Hermanus / Franschhoek our itinerary is quite tight so we would not like to get into any delays.    Thank you in advance for your ideas    Martin ,Martin H,,
hello    we (me+girlfriend) are planning to fly to Joburg. Firstly we would like to do some sigthseeing in Joburg and then go to Pilanesberg NP where we will do three days of guided safari.    We do not have any transfer to Pilanesberg NP yet since the transfer prices offered by agencies looks quite big. My question is is it worth to rent a car for those three and half days or is it better to go by Uber from Johannesburg to Pilanesberg and back? As I have mentioned above we will have a three days guided safari so we will do not need to use any car during our stay we just need to somehow get into Pilanesberg NP and back.

Here's what I was thinking:  Cape Town - 4 nights  Stellenbosch 2 nights  Franschhoek 2 nights  Barrrydale 1 night  Oudtshoorn 2 nights  Wilderness 1 night  Goukamma Nature Reserve 1 night  Plettenberg Bay 1 night  Nature's Way 2 nights  Outside Port Elizabeth before flying 1 night  Does it make sense to have fewer stops with longer stays? Some of the places look kinda close together. My initial thought was to spend two weeks in South Africa (though this slightly longer) and then fly to Victoria Falls and a safari perhaps Hwange.  I appreciate your comments and suggestions.  Also how far in advance should I start booking accommodations?  Does anyone have suggestions for favorite airlines from San Francisco? I'm considering Delta but don't want to rule out other international airlines because I am unfamiliar with them.  Thank you so much ,Mary Frances L,Garden Route,"San Jose, CA"
Hello everyone    I will be in Cape Town the first two weeks of November. It will be my first time visiting. I am aware of the suggested activities and the safety concerns. And so I would like some input on what I should prepare for. Note that I will not be renting a car and I will be staying in Seapoint.    1. My flight arrives in the early evening. After customs I’m sure it will be nearly dark. Will most reputable shuttle services be fine for transfer at that hour taking routes away from the townships etc?    2. Is there a good hiking tour or guide for Table Mountain? I am a well experienced hiker but I would prefer some company since I am unfamiliar with the area.    3. I plan on doing the shark cage excursion. I have been sailing many times before. However I am slightly concerned about seasickness. For anyone who has done this activity should I be worried about this? I am usually fine in close proximity to shore but when land goes completely out of sight the rough water can bother me.    4. Since I will not be visiting Kruger in the East what is the best day trip location for a short safari? It seems apparent that most places outside of Cape Town are merely drive-in fenced areas and observe the fed animals. Which area tends to be most worthwhile?  (I’ve heard of several needing to drive through townships and hijack areas for 20-30km. I hope this is a safe drive otherwise I cannot imagine tour groups normally doing this.)    5. I am very inexperienced with wine. I am aware that South Africa is renowned for their wine. What vineyards might be worth trying? And what varieties are best bringing home as gifts for family? There must be some that are very impressive and not readily available outside of the country.    6. Are there any restaurants worth looking in to? I prefer casual establishments over fine dining. Good local cuisine is ideal. I would love to see some recommendations.    7. If I hired a private driver for a day what would the average cost of this tend to be? Just based off of others’ past experiences.    I will provide any additional information as needed. Thank you for your assistance. I await the responses.

Greetings from New York USA    I'm planning my first-ever vacation to Africa and my first stop will be South Africa. I'm accumulating facts on the nation right now.    I've searched Google for webpages like https://bit.ly/45azCYQ which has additional extremely good information but I'd like to hear from anyone who has lately visited this nation.    Please assist me with understanding the following:    1. Which mobile network provider offers the best overall coverage and the fastest speed? How much does mobile data cost? Can I buy their SIM card at the international airport?    2. Is a bus available to take me from International Airport to the city's core (near Market)? If not what should the price of a taxi be?      3. Exist any ride-hailing applications like Uber or Bolt?    4. Do you know any trustworthy travel companies that provide day trips from town? ,Katelyn Williams,,"New York City, New..."

Hi the airline busted a wheel on my bag and it was horrendous dragging it miles to the car rental. Could I please ask if there is a way of getting it from the rental tomorrow back to the international check in? It took 20 minutes of struggle last time.    Also if so is there a cost? Or amount to tip?  Thank you ,Mandy G,Cape Town Central,Sydney
We are flying to Johannesburg next month. We haven't been to SA for about 10 years and wanted to know what vaccinations you need to go there do you need a Yellow Fever certificate? Struggling to make sense on the Government travel advice site. We are not travelling into a malaria area.    Also we used to draw out cash and pay in cash rather than using a card. Do most places still take cash after the pandemic or is a card a better option? ,margesimpson9,,Someret
Hi Everyone hope you'll are doing great!    Me and my wife have finally booked a trip to South Africa in March 2024. We both are very very excited!

Game drives - eat - sleep - repeat.    Thanks a lot for reading through. Haw does this itinerary look? Will you guys add or skip something? ,Chinmaysawant23,Cape Town,"Mumbai, India"

Just researching our next trip and have become abit concerned about driving from JNB to Kruger. I've been reading various things about how dangerous it is to drive through JNB and how even stopping for a short period at traffic lights is a risk people being followed from the airport ect.    We are travelling with older kids and I want to be able to enjoy it. Not be constantly worrying about our safety.    Just wondering if anyone has any recent honest experience as I know that looking on the Internet sometimes paints a different picture. Thanks in advance ,Rose,Kruger National Park,
Hi  We are staying in Franschhoek in November for 2 nights after international flight.    We are visiting more for the scenery. Although we do like wine we are not big drinkers or knowledgable.    What are good ways to get around other than the wine tram? Hiring a bike tuk tuk driver or uber? Has anyone heard of/ used the vinyard hopper driver servce?    What are nice wineries for white? I prefer sauvignon blanc    We would like wineries with nice scenery. We have noted Rickety Bridge la brie  La petit ferme leeu passant. Which if these fit the bill best?    We plan to go to mont rochelle for lunch    Is it worth getting a driver up helshoogte pass for the views.    Lots of questions and thanks for any helpful guidance ,Joheller,Franschhoek,"Wickford, United..."
We are a senior couple who are planning a first time trip to South Africa in May of 2024 for five weeks. We arrive CT and after a few days there plan on doing a self drive in the garden route. Then going to JB renting another car and driving to KNP ending back in J’burg for a few days before we fly home. We are very conscious of safety issues but on reading the many posts from both travellers and residents understand that safety is not really a concern any more than travelling in any other country/big city as long as one practices caution and sensible actions. However my understanding is there will be a general election in SA between May and August. 2024. How will this impact our plans for travel if at all? Will there be heightened safety concerns in any of the areas we plan to travel to? Will it be ok to do self drive? I understand it is extremely safe inside KNP. Will this still be the case? Any replies would be greatly appreciated. ,Judy H,,"Edmonton, Canada"

Hi everyone! My husband and will be in South Africa for about a month starting in October. While we're there we'll be renting a car and driving from Cape Town to Kruger via the Garden Route Lesotho/Drakensburg and Blyde Canyon. We'll fly out of Johannesburg.    We're having trouble figuring out the best driving routes for a few portions of our trip:    1. Garden Route/Addo Elephant National Park to Lesotho: We'll be spending a night in Mountain Zebra National Park along the way. We're staying at Malealea Lodge in southwestern Lesotho so we're hoping to use one of the border crossings along the southwestern border. Is there a border crossing you'd recommend?    2. Royal Natal National Park to Sabie: This seems like a long drive but we're hoping to do it in one day. Does that seem doable?    We're hoping to get some recommendations for good driving routes between these locations. We're most concerned about the routes being safe - and whether there are any routes we shouldn't take - but we'd also love to know if there are any routes that are particularly scenic/interesting!    Thanks in advance! ,Heather P.,,
Through Go Touchdown tours - will take 1 week safari tour mid Aug 2023.  Obviously I want to see Capetown as well and surrounding areas.  I think I will have maybe 3-4 days in Capetown.

Should I go with GO Touchdown  Or go with my travel agent and book 5 star hotels and go with a local tour company    Or    Go go through my travel agent for hotels and perhaps directly hire a private guide (no middle man involved) as recommended by trip advisor    Or    some other options. - including hop on hop off bus for Capetown. ,sookti,Cape Town,"Ottawa, Canada"

My wife and I are travelling to S.A. next January doing a week around Cape Town and flying to Joburg arriving 10:30 renting a car and driving to Kruger. (Jan 27 - Feb 3 /2024) First off is a wild card worth it? We are doing a Park by C.T. - have read the magic number is 7 stays? So we are trying to be budget conscious as we fly on Feb 4 to Vic Falls for a week - then back to Canada. 1. is it possible to get to the park arriving Joburg 10:30 - renting a car and we want to get to a reasonably cheap accommodation in the park. Or get to a location where we can set up game drives for the next day and then find accommodation's in the park. We plan on self driving a portion but would think being guided at the start will be beneficial. Don't want to camp - maybe glamp but we are not really set up to do any cooking etc. Hoping to see as much of the park and its wild life as is possible! Any and all help most welcome! Bear in mind budget conscious. Thanks Brian and Bonnie ,okemabeach,Kruger National Park,"Saskatoon, Canada"

Hello    I need some help about my flights.    As I am not used of the local rules and CemAir hide their cancellations conditions I am not sur if I can get a refund or not.  My first itinerary was HDS to CPT with CemAir (at the moment I book it it was no flight available from SZK (Skukuza) to CPT (much more convenient as much closer).    I got a email 2 days ago that my plane will make a technical stop in JNB and will arrive 1h late (okay no big deal).    Then again I got a new email yesterday with a totally new flight number a stop in JNB and another flight and obviously my original flight is no more existing.  I will arrive 3h45min late (7PM) and I need to take a car and drive almost at night to Franschhoek this was not expected at all.      I discovered a much better direct flight now with Airlink from SKZ to CPT.  So your help will be welcome if you know the regulation is SA. And if CemAir need to refund in this case. ,ChrisMandorra,Johannesburg,Geneva Switzerland

Looking at these 3 hotels for May 2024. Want to stay central to the waterfront. Family of 4 2A 2C ages 9 and 8. I was always drawn to Table Bay since I started my research but reviews are mixed especially of late and regards to room condition. The Commodore seems the best for being close to bus terminal and I would need 2 rooms which is nice to have the extra space. Some reviews lately though mirror the same as Table Bay in regards to the age of hotel and it not being as modern some issues with backup power and water temps. Finally the Radisson has quite a modern vibe and seems quite new. Restaurant looks nice and my kids would enjoy the bunk beds. It is the most affordable option but a little worried about the distance to get to shops and bus depot.    Thanks in advance for all the help. ,luv2travel2newplaces,Cape Town,"Lancaster, New York"

Hi there    We're coming to South Africa in November (not long to prepare!) and are struggling for the final week of our itinerary. We are flying in and out of Cape Town and would like to avoid Johannesburg.    At current I have the following booked:  Cape Town - 5 nights  Franschhoek - 2 nights  Kruger - 4 nights    The way our travel works we will have 8 nights left to fill and are really undecided where to go/what to do. We originally looked at Mauritius to relax for the final week but the flights don't work well with our dates. Can anyone recommend any beach destinations or relaxed destinations worth visiting?    I had considered going to Victoria Falls for a few days but was unsure if that's a lot of travel back and fourth. I was also unsure if it's worth visting Hermanus in November? I had read September is ideal time for whale watching and was unsure if there would be any point for us.    If need be we could change our flight home to go from somewhere else rather than Cape Town - considered Mozambique and Mauritius - but feeling a bit overwhelmed with where best to pick    TIA ,EilidhMitch,,

Hi    Thinking to plan a trip of a lifetime for August 2024 over two weeks. With my Husband and 10 year old Son. Would like opinions or advice as to whether it is practical or too much? Has anyone else done this?    So would be Greater Kruger (Sabi Sands maybe) 4 nights Victoria Falls 4 nights (including day trip to Chobe) Cape Town 4 nights and then Hermanus for 2 nights?    Except Cape Town to Hermanus direct flights between these locations are available I believe?    I really fancy the combination of the Greater Kruger safari with the River safaris on offer in Zambezi/Chobe. This would be our first African safari experience also really want to see the penguins and hopefully whales!    Does it sound like a good plan that would not be too rushed and crammed?    Many thanks ,S P,,

Hello I would love some advice / insights. My partner and I are heading to SA in March for two weeks mostly to see family in Cape Town. We’d like to spend three or four nights at a private reserve to get the safari experience.    My dilemma is this: we’re flying from Perth Western Australia and the flights are Perth-Singapore-Johannesburg-Cape Town. The Joburg stopover is a quick one hour.    I imagine the best safari experience would be to go Greater Kruger… so if you were in my position how would you do it? Would we fly to a smaller airport from CPT to reach our lodge?      Is there anything around Cape Town (like Aquila or Gondwana) that’s worthwhile if it’s easier than heading to Greater Kruger?    It just feels like a weird way of zigzagging around SA to go from CPT to Kruger and back to CPT for our flight out of SA.    Also if anyone has any recommendations for a lodge (maybe around 12K rand per night) I would greatly appreciate it. Overwhelmed by choice!    Thank you :) ,Stav P,,"Perth, Australia"

I have been told and read different things re our impending visit to Cape Town and travelling along the coast  ending with a safari.

We are due to stay in Plettenberg Bay for 3 days in a few weeks time.

Also I think we would like to go to the Robberg Nature Reserve...we love wildlife scenery and walking. Is it safe for us to go alone ( a couple in their 50s used to walking) or do we need a guide (there seems to have been safety concerns re South Africa lately  although hopefully more in the cities) ,jec5,Plettenberg Bay,

Do you think a full day game drive (5:00am to 15:00pm) is too long with such small children?    Would it be preferable to take it in two rounds?    Thanks for your help ,sara r,Kruger National Park,

We are driving along the Garden Route (any variations on the route gratefully received..we usually go off piste but have read it's not perhaps advisable in S.A at the moment) We have a 4 hour journey from Hermanus to get to Wilderness which is where our next B&B is booked. Any ideas on where to break the journey...sight seeing and/or eating wise? Not wanting a huge lunch but a sandwich would be nice!  Thanking all you helpful people out there in advance....btw we go early October ,jec5,Garden Route,
I will be spending a few months in Durban working at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital and hope to stay near to the beach.    I would be very grateful if anyone could let me know about any current public transport routes which run from Central Durban to the Inkosi Hospital and whether these are known to be safe. I cannot seem to find any obvious routes despite seeing other posts about the many bus routes operating in Durban. I am also aware this may have changed considerably since the Pandemic.    While staying near the beach I also hope to surf and swim though have seen recent news stories about local sewage contamination. I was wondering if anyone has heard what the current advice is with vis-à-vis getting in the water.    Any tips on where is best to stay in Central Durban would also be greatly appreciated!    Many thanks Louis ,Castro778,Durban,
Hi!    Leaving for SA in a week's time and still wondering about some safety issues. I am a solo female traveller and it seems like most of the tips and comments I see are concerning a group or at least a couple of poeple. So the questions I have are regarding traveling alone as a woman:  1. My main question is - is it ok to rent a car and drive from Cape Town to Swellendam?  2. Is Uber safe even at night? (will be arriving at 11 pm)    If the answer on the first question is straight up NO:  Do you have any idea if it would be possible to find an uber to Swellendam and than back? ,Petra,Western Cape,

We understand that load shedding is most likely going to be at level 6 for the forthcoming. I asked SANParks what the situation was ref. being able to have a functioning fridge lights and aircon but did not get a reply despite repeating the request.  Do they have a generator? How long does it run for?  We need to know this so we can work out how we manage food provisioning in the self catering chalets. It would be nice if the aircon worked as well.  An update on the current situation would be very helpful.  We are also going afterwards to Glen Reneen Mountain Zebra and Addo elephant.  Thanks ,Kat T,,"Twickenham, United..."
Hello everybody!  We are looking into visiting GKNP and KNP early May. We have 8 nights to spend.  We are thinking about spending 6 nights in private reserves and 2 nights inside KNP.  But how would you divide the 6 nights private lodges? Two times 3 nights or is three times 2 nights also doable (depending on how for from eachother maybe?)?    Also would love some recommendations for private lodges (tented and lodges both fine)? There are so many it's almost impossible to have a look at all of them! Budget per night private would be around 11.000 ZAR.    Thank you in advance! ,Kido O,Kruger National Park,

TA family -  I look to everyone here for a bit of advice. First time on safari and avid traveler. I have made adjustments to make sure that I am comfortable and walking upright upon arrival on most long flights and looking for advice on safari.  Most make mention that even the new vehicles in the private camps are bumpy (nature of the tour) and I get it. What has anyone used to lessen the burden on the lower back?  I have medication and portable TENS unit that I will bring along. Is there a small seat cushion or pillow you'd recommend?  TIA ,enjoyingourchildren,Kruger National Park,"Raleigh, North..."
Hello!  My husband and I (both 40) will be leaving from Denver and flying to Frankfurt for 2 days first then overnight flight to Cape Town arriving on October 8th in the morning. We are staying 2 nights at a friends' home in Newlands then 2 nights at a beach house in Kommetije before we make our way to Hermanus then Franschhoek (staying 2 nights each place).    Trying to wrap my head around a doable itinerary and would love any input on activities and places to eat for lunch.We love breweries laid back restaurants hiking/running and yoga. Not particularly interested in museums.    Day 1 (when we arrive): botanical gardens and walk around V&A waterfront. Dinner with our friends.    Day 2: Table Mountain and Lions Head hike lunch in Woodstock area see Bo-Kap area. Dinner with friends  ** Add on anything on this day?    Day 3: Possible kayak tour at Hout Bay in the morning then drive Chapman's Peak  **Are there any recommended hikes to do in that general area and if so is it safe to leave our car parked at the trailhead? Lunch at a brewery in Noordhoek. Possibly stop at Muzenberg beach late afternoon?  ** Has anybody in that area done surf lessons there? I would love to do this but wasn't sure about the conditions/safety/ease of that. Could also save this to do on the day we leave and drive to Hermanus    Day 4: Drive down to Cape of Good Hope lighthouse up to Smitswinkel Bay and to Simonstown to see the penguins at Boulders Beach.... lunch in Kalk Bay (@ Brass Bell pub). Meet back up in the evening for dinner with friends in Scarborough or Noordhoek.    10/12: Possible yoga class at studio in Kommetjie in the morning then make our way to Hermanus. ** Any suggestions of places to stop on the way there are appreciated! We will be doing a whale watch tour the next day and do the cliff coastal walk and head out on the 14th early to go to wine area.    Thanks so much! ,Melanie H,Cape Town,"Arvada, Colorado"

Four of us visiting Cape Town in early November. One of us is a keen photographer and has identified Bloubergstrand as a good spot to get sunset shots with Table Mountain in the shot.

Hi I'm thinking of visiting Rorke's Drift. My outline plan is to arrive Durban pick up hire car and drive to Battlefields Country lodge stay there for 2 nights and then drive on to Johanasberg on Day 3.

Hi    We are at the very early stages of planning a trip for 2025 as I have a birthday that ends in a zero!!    We are planning to do a 4-5 day safari and then looking at Franschhoek as a base for a few days as we really love our wines and have done a decent amount of vineyard tours in other countries and love the idea of the wine tram to hop on-off and plan a few vineyards with nibbles plus there looks a decent amount of places to eat in the evening and pamper ourselves post safari.    My question is whether there are companies that organise bus excursions from Franschhoek to Cape Town to visit things like table top & Robben Island whilst keeping our base as Franschhoek.    I hope this makes sense to you guys I'm not really looking to hire a car as I tend to leave the car at the airport and not think about driving whilst I am on holiday which is why I wondered if organised small group excursions exist?    thanks in advance ,dmats07,Franschhoek,Aberdeen
Hi after some of your wisdom/advice if anyone can help?!  Planning a 3 night stay in Johannesburg to then fly onto Victoria falls for 7 days.  Travelling with my 12 year old daughter in July time so I'm trying to decide a suitable itinerary.  It's a night flight from UK so land 11 am ish so how does    Thurs am fly in  PM apartheid museum    Fri am and PM gold reef city amusement park    Sat am and PM choice of trips maybe combining caves or soweto and a animal park?    Sun am - Sunday market visit  Sun PM fly to Victoria falls    Was planning on 3 day safari at the falls so not thinking to do one here.  Accommodation was thinking of gold reef city hotel. Not central but was thinking with a 12 year old gives her fun time included and looks safe there.  She obv wants to see/experience as much as can animal and culture wise so if anything better to do with free days there??? ,Tim M,Johannesburg,
We arrive on Sept 23 early evening (15 hour overnight flight) for 5 nights in Cape Town. We are considering Table Mountain for Sunday morning (we will either be up at the crack of dawn or barely able to get out of bed) or a couple museums for our first day with jetlag. We do have Tea booked at 3:00 pm at the Mount Nelson Hotel. If we do not go on Sunday we can aim for Monday or Wednesday for Table Mountain.  How long should we figure for Table Mountain if we walk some of the trails at the top? Should we purchase timed fast track tickets? If we change our minds can the tickets be rebooked for another day? How important is it to book the tickets in advance?  Museum ideas would include Zeitz MOCAA or The South African Jewish Museum and the Holocsust Center...both of which will close early on the 24th 2pm I believe.  For our other days we havea drive for a city tour one day and Good Hope the other. Our last day we have left currently unplanned.  As always your suggestions are most welcome. ,aedrbf,Cape Town Central,West Hartford...

Morning All    I took my passport into the VFS office to renew my SA passport plus change my surname following my marriage.  I took it into VFS in January 2023 with the only feedback I received was a clearer copy of the marriage certificate (asked for and sent in July).    I have chased now on a daily basis with the only feedback I've received being your document is now with Home Affairs and so nothing we can do to follow up).    It has now been almost 10 months and am increasingly anxious about this as I need to travel back to SA at the end of October.    If anyone has any advice on this topic I would greatly appreciate it.    Gemma ,Mike H,,
Hi    We'll finish our garden route trip at Cape Town for 2 days coming from the Garden Route.  We're more nature people so eager to see Boulder Beach.    I have 2 questions :)  1. Is it a good idea to stay at Boulder Beach? Or better to go more in the city (in a safe area like V&A because we're concerned about security)  2. Can you recommend a safe drive coming from the Garden Route to Boulders ?

Hello everyone.    We are having second thoughts whether we should visit South Africa or skip it. We have little kids traveling with us. We have all flights/accommodations booked and very excited. Johannesburg/Kruger park/Capetown. However reading about safety problems and so many incidents plus load shedding issue we are really thinking about canceling. After all you go on vacations to relax and not to worry about someone mugging you or scamming you. I mean carjacking sexual assault and even murder are serious issues.    I am not sure if everything is kind of over exaggerated or reality? Please advise. ,9kdoc9,Johannesburg,Rochester Hills...
Hi Experts.  Am planning a trip with my family for 2024 down to Hoedspruit from the UK. My daughters (16 and 12 at the time) will need to fly back to London before i do but i want to make sure that it is all as simple as possible for them.    My plan is for the 3 of us to fly from Skukuza to JNB (Airlink probably). Then at JNB we can collect their luggage and check it in at British Airways desks. Then all 3 of us will go back through security. I then want to walk with them to their gate and wait until they depart. I will then walk to the gate for Airlink back to Skukuza.    Is all of this possible? Is it possible/allowed to walk between international departures and internal departures?    Thanks  Nick ,nickhills1,Johannesburg,"Lytham, United..."

We are looking to do some walking too. We arrive into Durban airport at 7.30 pm on Sunday night so my thought was to stay at Catkin Park for 2 nights taking in the choir on Monday then drive up the mountain for a 3 night stay to enjoy the scenery etc. our next stop will be Hluhluwe staying on the Kuleni Game Reserve using this as our base for 4 nights to do St Lucia Sodwana Bay and Imfolozi Park. Then travelling back to Durban for a flight home.  Would love advice on the routing - am I doing this the best way around and also hotel stays. Thanking you in advance ,Beverley H,Drakensberg Region,

Reposting question in case someone can help!    Hello everyone    I really need some help and I hope I can find some answers here. Let me start off that I have been calling consulate and embassies in US and Mexico and their phone lines seem to be disconnected and/or out of service. Also I have emailed them multiple times and till this day I have not heard from them.    I am a Mexico passport holder and have a US green card. Mexican passport holders do need visas for South Africa. However in this trip I will not be visiting South Africa I will only transit.    I have a flight with Air Botswana from Maun to JNB (OR Airport) that arrives at JNB at 4 PM. That same day I have a flight with Ethiopian Airlines from JNB to Addis Ababa at 11 PM. These are separate tickets. I did read that if you transit through OR you don't need a transit visa but here is my question. Since I am technically leaving the airport and checking in with a different airline I would need to pass immigration etc would I need to apply for a transit visa? Has anyone had an experience similar to this?    My last resource is to go from Texas to Washington DC Embassy in person to get a transit visa since I have been unable to resolve anything from home.    I would appreciate if anyone has any feedback. Thank you for your help.    Happy travels! ,Mtravels,,

Hello    I have a Safari booked for end of March early April next year in Timbavati / greater Kruger.    It seems I should expect average lows of around 18c at this time of year which back home would be t-shirt and thin jumper - hoody even accounting for the wind-chill of an open sided vehicle.    I read a lot about the need for multiple layers thick coats hates and gloves for the early mornings and evenings.    Is that really necessary for late March early April?

Hi    We're coming to Cape Town in December for 10 days and other than the ususal tourist spots are there any other things we should be adding to our itinerary? Kids aged 7 -12.

I have an ambitious trip in mind for the summer of 2026 and I want to just get a bit of feedback on each of the stops along the way from anyone who has visited any of these places. The logistics work out nicely between each place with commercial flights connecting all 3 countries.    The itinerary/properties I have my eyes on currently are:  4 nights Tswalu  1 night overnight in Kigali  3 nights Amakoro Songa Lodge  4 nights Kilindi    Seeing Mountain Gorillas and Golden Monkeys had remained on my list and so has Tswalu. I discussed a full Rwanda itinerary with our travel agent which included Magashi but my thinking is we can visit two places we’ve really wanted to go to on one trip without the logistics seeming too crazy since we can catch commercial flights between all of the locations. My wife wants to visit Zanzibar so while talking the trip through I thought sure why not. Would love to do andBeyond Mnemba but I think Kilindi looks great at about 1/4 of the price.    Any suggestions/feedback are welcome! Thank you in advance for responses! ,threepointkid,,Carmel Valley...
Greetings:    I am looking to tie in a 7-9 day visit to South Africa with an upcoming visit to Brazil. Glad to see there are direct nonstops from São Paulo that take “only” 7 hours. Probably looking at anywhere from mid March to mid April of next year.    Couple of questions:    1. Where is the best (presumably also safest) area for a solo traveler to stay in a nice hotel within walking distance or short Uber rides to great restaurants and good nightlife?    2. What is the best beach area?….Iooks like mid March to April though not the best would still be OK for some beach time (not the focal point of my trip).    3. I would like to see wildlife though I’m probably not the type to spend 4-5 nights at a game reserve. Ideally would like to see lions elephants and giraffes….I do see Fairy Glen Game reserve is just over an hour away from Cape Town and it is possible to visit just for a day….any other parks or reserves that also are close….if I decided to spend a night at a reserve can you recommend the best reserve or two within a 2 hour drive?    4. Looks like there are a couple of wine regions within an hour from Cape Town…is there a winery or two that stands out which you would recommend? ,El Chevere,Cape Town,"Miami, Florida"
I've skimmed the forum and not quite found my answer so hoping someone can help. We arrive via airlink from Hoedspruit at roughly 1500 our international departure back to the states leaves at 2155 and is on a separate itinerary. We will likely have at least one checked bag in addition to our carry-ons so will have to claim and recheck/check in for our international departure.    Generally looking for guidance on how to handle this transition specific questions are:    1. is that enough time to warrant renting a day room nearby? if so recs?  2. How early will we be able to recheck our bag? (realize this could depend on the airline we'll be flying delta)  3. will we have to exit security? We have lounge access but it looks like all are on departure side of security.  4. Assuming we do leave the airport how early do you recommend getting there to check in for the 2155 international flight?  5. Have heard theft is potentially a problem from luggage that sits after check-in assume we need locks and to have it wrapped?    Feel free to tell me what else I'm not considering and thanks so much! ,sro42,Johannesburg,"Atlanta, Georgia"

Hi all    We dined earlier this year at Delaire Graff restaurant on the terrace and it was a highlight.    We are returning to South Africa in February and will be driving from Cape Town to Franschhoek on February 25th which also happens to be my birthday!    Is there anywhere you would suggest for lunch that we could stop at along the way that is as special as Delaire Graff or should we just return?!

I have accepted a position at Uni Stellenbosch and will be spending some time there in the summer (December-February) with my wife and 6-month old baby. The position is primarily remote and this will be our first time in SA. Our current itinerary looks like this:  - December 5-22: Staying in or around Stellenbosch for ‘acclimatisation’ and shorter commute  - December 22-January 10: Roadtrip maybe Garden Route (?)  -January 10-February 10: Staying around Cape Town commuting to Stellenbosch.    My specific questions:  1. Should we rent a car for the whole stay?  We have lived both in car-dominated cities (Athens) and the opposite (Copenhagen). I would gladly rent a car and use it for commuting and for road trips during our stay but reading about the potential dangers of driving around CT has me second-guessing.    2. Commuting from Cape Town to Stellenbosch?  After the holidays we are thinking of getting a long-term Airbnb somewhere along the coast. Either on the Atlantic coast (Camps Bay Hout Bay etc) or on False Bay (Surfers Corner Kalk Bay Fish Hoek). We are looking for a safe walkable area by the sea where my wife and the baby can enjoy the beach some nice cafes maybe some art? I don’t mind driving but given what I’ve read here about no-go zones it will be a 1.30hrs drive each way. Does this sound like a good plan to you? Or should we just stick to Stellenbosch?    3. Any suggestions on where to stay in Stellenbosch given I will be working at STIAS?    4. Any other recommendations about where to stay what to look out for suggestions for trips are VERY welcome. We are very excited about spending some time in South Africa and we really don’t want to succumb to fear about crime or load shedding or whatnot. But there’s also much we don’t understand so any suggestions will be much appreciated. ,FilippoSt,Cape Town,"Copenhagen, Denmark"

Hi    In the past we visited Ethosha Okavango and Tshobe where we encountered many different animals but we have not seen many big cats. Next year August/September we will visit Kruger and would like to see lions and leopards (and maybe a cheetah if we are very lucky).    Some research reveals that cats are more present in the south-eastern part of Kruger.  --> Is this correct ?    Keeping in mind our budget (+/- 1000€/1100$ per night all in) I found following lodges that are more or less in the area:  - Main Jock lodge  - Simbavati river lodge  - Nkorho  - Rhino Post  - Notten  --> Which lodge would you recommend to maximize the chance of viewing lions leopards other cats ? Maybe there are other alternatives ?    Thx Ben ,greyben,Kruger National Park,belgium

We are first time travelers to South Africa and will be spending a few days in Johannesburg on our way into the country so we can acclimate to the time zone difference before traveling to a reserve for the majority of our trip. We have a transfer booked from the airport (staying in Houghton) and have transportation provided for the couple of excursions we've booked but I'm wondering about getting around to dinners and possibly a tourist attraction or two. Walking after dark does not seem to be the best idea although that area seems relatively safe. Is Uber reliable/safe? Are taxis readily available in that area? What would you recommend we use and what are approximate costs for doing so? ,MAConvert,Johannesburg,Berkshires...
Hello all  Could someone recommend a reliable and efficient VIP service that could help me bypass long passport control lines in JNB airport?  I have 2 hrs 20 min connection between arrival in JNB and my next flight to Maun. Flights are not on the same ticket so I will probably need to get through passport control.  Normally I would feel comfortable with 2 hrs - especially since I travel only with carry-ons (no checked luggage) and will be in the front of the plane (so will not be the last person to disembark) but if my flight from Doha is delayed it might be tight.  I have always encountered long lines to passport control in JNB so I would feel better if someone helps me make it quick.  I saw some VIP services recommendations in the past but I know things change companies go out of business and new companies appear so if someone had a recent positive experience with a company that helped them in JNB - please share. thank you!! ,rg09,Johannesburg,midwest

Hi All i need help to decide my itinerary for 28th Nov - 1st Dec  both days being inclusive. We are a couple travelling to Jo burg and returning back from Cape Town. We are sorted with our plan at Cape Town from 2nd Dec to 7th Dec. So we have 5 nights at Cape Town which we wish to cover Cape Town and surroundings. Now the big question is how do we allocate time to the beginning 4 nights of 28th Nov - 1st Dec. We arrive at Jo burg on the morning of 28th.. One idea could be to do the 2 day Safari tour at Pilanesburg. Then take a flight to Port Elizabeth and then do the garden route for next two days. Would need specific advise to where to base my stay on the Garden route so as to reach Cape Town on 02nd Dec. Another thing cud be to not do Pilanesburg and try for some good reserve near Port Elizabeth. Please send suggestions how to plan the first four days in an efficient manner so as to maximise safari experience and Garden route that will help me to get to cape Town on 2nd mid day. ,Nawal G,Cape Town,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi all trying my luck and hoping to get some advice from the experts! We're a family of 4 including 2 toddlers an almost 2-year old and a 35 year old and we'll be traveling from Europe to Capetown end of September.    We have booked all of our accommodation and we have rented a car. We'll be traveling in/to Stellenbosch Oudtshoorn safari in the Eastern Cape then the Garden Route to end the trip with a couple of nights of Capetown.    I'm having 2 questions mostly related to safety (and mostly considering we're traveling with small children).    - While traveling the Garden Route on our last stop we're overnighting in Swellendam. I am considering the sunset whale boat trip with Ivanhoe on our way from Swellendam to Capetown. This means we'll have 1.30h drive from Swellendam to Gansbaai which is fine but it also means we would be doing a 2.20h drive from Gansbaai to Capetown where our next accommodation is booked (Green point) mostly in the dark. I have a thing for sunsets hence the sunset boat trip but should common sense here tell me not to take a 2h drive to Capetown in the dark? or am I being paranoid?    - unrelated but has anyone experience with using UBERS with toddlers? I booked dinner in Capetown one evening but would prefer an Uber instead of driving ourselves. Is Ubering realistic with small children?    - lastly and even more unrelated. I read somewhere that it is no longer possible to swim at Boulders Beach (or Foxy beach not really sure). Anyone recently been there and knows whether something has recently changed? (Managing my expectations here I also have a thing for penguins).    Many thanks!!  K ,KikiGov,,Luxembourg City...
We are connecting in JNB from BA 0057 from LHR onto 4Z 0300 (Airlink) to MUB. When I booked it we had just under 3 hours connection time. All booked on one ticket/PNR so assuming our bags will be checked through to final destination.    Since then BA has revised the arrival time in JNB to be 45 mins later (same take-off time!) and recent flights have all been later even than that; some days arriving AFTER the scheduled departure of our Airlink connecting flight 🤬! I am wondering what chance we have of making that connection? Does anyone know if Airlink will wait for our BA flight? No other flights to MUB til the following day . . . ,PinkNosedPenguin,,"Wiltshire, United..."
Hi  My husband and I have booked a long awaited trip to Cape Town and a 2 week tour across the Garden Route finishing at a Game Reserve. I have major concerns about our safety (I have read a lot today) whilst we are there and would appreciate any advice.  We are staying at the V&A Hotel for 3 nights and have booked a car transfer from the airport and guided tours for two days - one in a group one private. After our 3rd night we are travelling to Franschhoek and have a hire car for 11 days. We pick up the hire car at Strand Street. What is the best way to do this - how do we get both of us and our luggage there from the Waterfront hotel? Is it ok for us both to get a taxi or Uber with our luggage?    Secondly we plan on using our iPhones and Google Maps to navigate. Is it safe to do this inside our locked hire car or would it be better to pay for GPS in the car and hide the phones.    Finally we are going to the main tourist areas only as part of the Cape Town tours. Is it safe to use our phones to take photos.    Sorry to sound paranoid but would appreciate some guidance.    Thanks! ,HampshireSue,Cape Town,Hartley Wintney...

Hello everyone    I really need some help and I hope I can find some answers here. Let me start off that I have been calling consulate and embassies in US and Mexico and their phone lines seem to be disconnected and/or out of service. Also I have emailed them multiple times and till this day I have not heard from them.    I am a Mexico passport holder and have a US green card. Mexican passport holders do need visas for South Africa. However in this trip I will not be visiting South Africa I will only transit.    I have a flight with Air Botswana from Maun to JNB (OR Airport) that arrives at JNB at 4 PM. That same day I have a flight with Ethiopian Airlines from JNB to Addis Ababa at 11 PM. These are separate tickets. I did read that if you transit through OR you don't need a transit visa but here is my question. Since I am technically leaving the airport and checking in with a different airline I would need to pass immigration etc would I need to apply for a transit visa? Has anyone had an experience similar to this?    My last resource is to go from Texas to Washington DC Embassy in person to get a transit visa since I have been unable to resolve anything from home.    I would appreciate if anyone has any feedback. Thank you for your help.    Happy travels! ,Cruiser24488746128,,

Hi all my girlfriend and I are planning to head to Lesedi Cultural Village as a day trip. We see there are many tours online which includes a guide and transport but they tend to be pretty expensive vs the entrance fees for Lesedi Village (which seems to include a guide on premise).

I wonder if it's worth booking an Uber or going on the HOHO bus to a wine farm?    Any pointers on where to eat....we are not big meat eaters btw. Do we need to book all restaurants in advance?    We leave Cape town and travel to Hermanus so wonder whether to go to Boulder Point.en route or travel there on day 3 when we have the car?

What are the better options if i'm coming from Maputo. Are there jeep tours available or is a personal car needed. (I can afford one)  2) How many days should i allocate for Kruger safari.  3) Is Johannesburg a good addition to this itinerary and which part of Johannesburg should i choose ? (Because its a sparse city I may not be able to explore it as much as i like travelling solo and because of safety concerns)  4) Anything that i should add on the cape town adjacent areas itinerary ?  5) If anybody has an idea about Mozambique.

Hi all: I'm planning a couples trip for 2 to SA and have hit a bit of a wall. I'd like to spend a few nights in Capetown and a few nights in Kruger and would also love to bookend my long journey from DC by beginning or ending with a few nights at a resort along the Indian Ocean.  I had always wanted to tack on Mozambique with an SA trip and getting there has proven much more difficult than I imagined! I've also looked into the more obvious Seychelles and Mauritius and that's just as difficult if not worse. Are the KZN beach resorts a similar vibe? Am I crazy to think this is possible?

We are trying to decide if we want to get to the tram with the tour bus that picks you up in Cape Town or use Uber/taxi. We like the flexibility of creating our own schedule but need to know if we will have difficulty getting back to Cape Town in the late afternoon. ,Lorraine C,,"Naples, Florida"
My wife and I plan to visit Cape Town in mid-December and then stay for two nights in Franschhoek and then head to the Garden Route. We wonder is it feasible to include Cape Agulhas in the trip from Franschhoek to the Garden Route (according to Google Maps Cape Agulhas is 3 hours drive from Franschhoek) and is it worth the detour? Also after the detour we will probably be too tired to drive all the way to the beginning of the Garden Route that day is it a good idea to stay in Montagu as it seems to be on Route 62 and only a couple of hours from Cape Agulhas?    Any insight will be appreciated. This is our first trip to South Africa and we plan to dedicate four days to the Garden Route including the Knysna Elephant Park. ,Boris V,,"Reston, Virginia"

We are about to travel in cape town beggining of 02/24 & we are looking for the best game reserve in Eastern cape region  we will definitely stay in addo elephant park but we will also like to book somewhere else.  Reading the critics Shamwari & Kwandwe are mentioned as one of the best in the region. Is that so? Could someome suggest somewhere else? We would like to have an experience of a game reserve with plenty of animals & also if possible the room view to be as closer to animals/waterhol we are not so fun of bush view. Last we have planned a road trip in gardens route what is the best place to stay over for a night?  Any personal opinion/suggestion would be highly appreciated 🙏 ,Mairi,,"Nicosia, Cyprus"
I have recently started researching for a trip to KNP next year. The posts on this forum have been invaluable in helping me to make decisions on how we want to visit the park and where we will focus our attention so thank you to all who have posted. I do still have some questions though.  For background we are a couple in our 50's who enjoy international travel (or at least we did pre-Covid) and prefer independent travel to package tours.    1. We are planning to fly into JNB then take an Airlink flight to SZK. I would prefer to book all the way to SZK on one ticket but flight times connections and fares are all more convenient if I book Airlink separately rather than as part of our international ticket. How much time at a minimum should we allow at JNB between our international flight landing and our domestic flight leaving?    2. I have read mixed reviews for both the Sunset and Night Game Drives offered from the Rest Camps (Morning Game Drives seem to have more favorable reviews). The quality of the driver and the animals seen are what most influence the reviews both of which aren’t controllable so I still plan to make reservations for at least 1 of each type of Drive. Our current plan is to stay 2-3 nights each at Skuzuza Lower Sabie Satara and Letaba in late Aug/early Sep. Any opinions on why it would be better to book a particular drive at a particular location?    3. Going on a Bush Braai sounds like a great experience. These can’t be reserved when making the standard lodging/activity booking online through SANparks and the Rest Camp needs to be contacted directly. Should I make a request soon after reserving lodging (nearly a year ahead) or wait until closer to our visit? If I want to email the rest camp rather than calling would I contact the Hospitality Manager listed for the camp? Is it likely I would I be able to modify an existing Sunset or Night Drive reservation to a Bush Braai if one becomes available once we’re onsite and there is a conflict with an existing reservation?    4. I read on SANparks website that it is necessary to have cash to pay at the gas stations at the rest camps. Do we also need cash to use at the restaurants and shops in KNP or can we use credit cards?    5. We plan to buy an International Wildcard which I understand is valid for 1 year. Is this a calendar year so I should wait to purchase until 2024? Is it 1 year from date of purchase? Is it better to buy ahead online or should we wait and purchase the Wildcard after landing at SZK?    6. Having done a trial run at making reservations on SANparks using their new Online Bookings platform it asks if (a) you already have a Wildcard (b) you’ll purchase at the park or (c) you’ll pay the conservation fee online. Can I select (a) even if I haven’t purchased our Wildcard yet but plan to purchase online? Will I be asked to enter an ID# or some other identifier at some point? If I select to pay at the park can I still purchase the Wildcard online at a later date or would that change how our reservation is worded? I want to make lodging reservations as soon as they open up to get the location & style of lodging that we want especially since they are fully cancellable/changeable this far out.    I apologize for this being such a long post but I look forward to everyone’s insights.  Thank you! ,tripnmex,Kruger National Park,"Tucson, Arizona"
Have transited J'berg many times but this time get in at 4am and leave around noon on Airlink to Botswana on a separate ticket. Check in is not an issue as I can do this online but wondering how early I can drop my bag - both from what Airlink allows and from a security aspect.

I am planning a trip with my family which includes 3 teenagers during the period between Christmas & New Year.  I cannot decide between a resort in the Wilderness (Boardwalk) or in Brenton on Sea (Brenton haven) . Both are close to the ocean.  We would like to spend the time focusing on getting to know the area between George and Knysna and are not too interested on venturing further than Knysna.  We would like to include some fun activities in the forests and rivers in addition to spending a few days at the ocean. Whilst I understand that it is peak holiday week we would prefer a less busy area.  Where should be stay in order to experience the best of this area and which would avoid too much driving back and forth to the resort. ,Feroza C,,Cape Town Central...

Hi all this may seem like a silly question but could anyone recommend a good grocery store (place and chain) to stop at on the drive from Jo'berg to Thendele Camp in Royal Natal National Park where we could buy pre-made food like sandwiches etc. and other foods for breakfast and hiking.    I know some chains are better with the pre-made items than others and I thought this very helpful group might have some insight. TY! ,Mappy Traveler,Drakensberg Region,
I am in South Africa early Sept. I leave Eswatini en route to Durban and I want to stop in the Drakensburg area. In the general area of Eswatini towards the Drakensburg area is it ok to be on the road at night? Any road better then others? I am using a tour guide who thinks it's ok however I am curious what the folks here think.    In addition i can either do the Sani Pass area in the Southern Berg or Royal Natal Park in the Northern Berg. Is either of these more photogenic then the other? I know this is subjective simply wondering if it's a toss up type of thing or one is more recommended over the other. I will have one day in either location once I get there.    Lastly is there a reason to avoid traveling in this area at this time of year? Thank you! ,awardticket,,Nj

We are a fairly active family of 4 (kids are 14 &17) visiting Cape Town for 3 full days in mid-September. We have already booked a full day excursion to Cape of Good Hope/Boulders/Hout Bay but are trying to figure out the other 2 days; one of those nights we've booked a reservation at Gold. We definitely also hope to experience Table Mountain but understand that's weather-dependent. So with teens in mind should we:  1. just book a HOHO bus and explore?  2. make sure we get to Robben Island?  3. plan for a guided walk through Bo Kaap or another neighborhood?  4. book the Segway tour at Spier so the adults get some wine experience too?  5. something else I haven't even thought of?    We know there's more to see and do in the CT area but this trip only allows 3 days there before going to our safari near Kruger. Appreciate any help! ,sro42,Cape Town,"Atlanta, Georgia"

Hello all    We're a 33yo couple and it will be our first time in SA :) We're really into seeing wildlife (our initial goals are to see Kruger and Boulders Beach ^^) not much into cities. We'll land at Johannesburg on 23rd Jan and leave from Cape Town on 6th Feb.    Here's a first rough idea of our plan would love to get your feedbacks :    1. Land drive directly to Kruger NP  2. Stay 4-5 nights at Kruger  3. Fly from Nelspruit to Port Elizabeth go to Addo Elephant Park  4. Drive along the Garden Route to Cape Town  5. Few days at Cape Town    Do you think it's a good idea to fly to Port Elizabeth and to the Garden Route for wildlife ? Or would it better to fly to Cape Town directly and drive around the area? Or maybe I miss some great national parks?    Thanks a lot! ,David P,,"Paris, France"

First of all I want to give a big thanks to all the South Africa destination experts and regular posters on this forum I've been lurking on here for many years as I plan our much delayed South Africa trip. I spent several months working in Natal in the early 90's and became a big fan of the Bunny Chow. I've not been back to South Africa since and this trip will focus on Cape Town and Kruger area will not be going to KwaZulu-Natal. So I'm hoping I might be able to get a good Bunny in Cape Town. I have heard of the Eastern Food Bazaar is that our best bet? Also interested in any truly unique food/restaurant suggestions several people have mentioned Marco's and that looks interesting. Will be staying in the V&A area in late February and hoping to get around mainly by hop on/hop off and foot during the daylight hours. ,Patrick H,Cape Town,"Victoria, Canada"

Hello everyone    Your advise would be greatly appreciated!    I will be leaving Sabi Sands around 10am and heading down to Drakensberg. I would like to go to Royal Natal NP. It looks like an 8 hour drive so I think it would be better to stay somewhere for the night as I prefer not to drive at night. I plan on waking up early the next day to do a hike. Amphitheatre hike perhaps?    Any suggestions on which town to stay prior to heading to Royal Natal? Ideally somewhere I can check in around 6-7pm and with a good grocery store nearby.    Also is it safe to drive at night?    Thanks a bunch!  Tony J ,tonyjeyan,UKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park,"Toronto, Canada"
Hi all    South Africa is calling to us again so we considering a trip for September 2024. We love the private reserves in the Greater Kruger and we have also been to Kwandwe in the Eastern Cape and Phinda in KwaZulu Natal. Obviously though spending a whole holiday in a private reserve would end up pretty costly. Our last holiday to SA was in 2018 and we spent a few nights in the Blyde River Canyon area four nights at Kings Camp in Timbavati a few days self driving in the Kruger (based at Satara) and finished the trip with three nights in Savannah at Sabi Sands.    Madikwe Game Reserve looks great (especially as Wild Dogs have eluded us so far). We love the look of Madikwe Hills Private Game Lodge but wonder if we should break up the stay at Madikwe in two separate lodges? Any suggestions? We prefer lodges that only have six people per vehicle and don’t dine ‘family style’ every night.    Is it worth stopping and self driving in Pilanesberg. I’ve read that it gets very busy. I’ve also seen that there are private lodges in Pilanesberg. Do the game drives from the private lodges have to queue up with the self drivers at sightings?      Another option is self driving in the north of the Kruger before staying at Timbavati (Mankanyi looks great). We don’t want to drive from Madikwe to Kruger.    Any suggestions or ideas while we at the ‘pondering’ stage would be great.    Thanks a lot    Rachel ,Rachel,,"Exeter, United..."

Hi    I’m looking at spending 3/4 nights on safari in eastern cape and so far have liked the look of both Bukela and Pumba.

hello all    We are arriving in South Africa on oct 27th and we are stuck between 3 itineraries.  1 is madikwe-  2 is sabi sands/or timbavati area  3 gorongosa in mozambique    We are on a quest to possibly see the wild dogs (I know they are not guaranteed) but we would like to put ourselves in the best position to see them). Some people say Kruger is best others say Kruger is just so big that it's harder and to go to madikwe. I know the best places to go to see wild dogs in manna pools but it is out of our price range right now and we already purchased tickets to South Africa    If you recommend madikwe---any lodging that you absolutely recommend? we do not want to pay more than $500 per night and would love to take advantage of any specials :). stay 3 pay 2 etc.    SAME question for sabi/Timbavati?    if you have been to gorongosa----why do you love it or hate it? I know this is a South Africa forum but I find people who love safari typically go all over :).      thank you so much ,connemara22,,Levittown...
I have this question. My wife and I plan to arrive in Cape Town in mid-December. We want to stay ideally close to the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden since we plan to go there the next day after we arrive. We are renting a car. The word is that driving in Cape Town after dark is discouraged for safety reasons. Our flight arrives at 6:00pm and the sunset in Cape Town at that time of the year is at 7:54pm.    So my question is — would it be smart to reserve a hotel in the city (i.e. 12 miles from the airport) and plan to drive there if all we have is about two hours for the customs collecting our baggage getting the rental car and getting to our hotel? Or should we stay next to the airport and then drive into the city the next morning?    Any help will be appreciated. This is our first trip to South Africa. ,Boris V,Cape Town,"Reston, Virginia"
Hi there  My wife and I are South African but 3 kids are not and are coming for a holiday. We'd like to buy a Wild Pass because we are doing 5 days in Kruger 1 night in Addo maybe a day or 2 in Hluhluwe and some activities in Cape Town (mountain cape point and boulders).  We thought that the family pass all access wild card would be great but have a couple questions:  - Oldest daughter will be 19 but definitely looks under 18.  - Kids are not SA citizens.    The T&Cs of the wild card say that one of the children's ID may be checked. What are the chances that this happens? And if we dont take our chances what version of Wild Card should we get?    thanks  J ,JP,Kruger National Park,"Sydney, Australia"

My husband and I from NY are looking to go on a safari in the summer/fall of 2024 and would love to hear recommendations for a good tour operator. We’re not looking for luxurious accommodations but we don’t want to camp out in the woods either. Our main focus is on seeing as many wild animals as possible though side trips to other popular places like Cape Town Victoria Falls or Table Mountain etc would be great as well. We’d like to go for about 10-14 days and our budget (excluding international airfare) is about $5000 a person.  We know this is not a trip we could plan on our own since there are so many logistics. Would love to hear suggestions as to tour operators or travel agents you’ve used that you’d highly recommend (or anyone to avoid for that matter) Also is that budget reasonable for what we want? I’ve looked online and seen a lot of luxury tours for way over our budget or ones that involved a lot of camping or many hours on a bus traveling from one location to another.

Hey guys  I have two questions:  1) Is it safe to drive from JNB (Tambo Intl Airport Johannesburg) to Kruger? I know plenty of posts covered this topic but I couldn't find any from the past couple of years. Just need some reassurance that this will be ok. Mostly concerned about the possibility of carjacking.  2) We will be staying at Berg-en-dal rest camp the first night. According to google Melelane gate is the closest. From JNB to Melalane we would be taking the N12 and N4 highways. Is this route safe? Or would you recommend alternate highways/routes to a different gate that's safer? Thank you in advance for your help! ,L R,Johannesburg,United States
BA has changed flight times for our flight tomorrow LHR -JNB- GABORONE so a decent transit time is now 55mins ( I presume due to the ongoing Niger airspace issue) . I had already figured from posts on here that I just had to go through the international transit area (as one ticket) even though the flight details show the GAB airlink flight as terminal B . I hope that's correct but is the transit time now too short even for that ? ,d a,Johannesburg,
Hi  I am thinking of travelling to Port Elizabeth in January. I'd like to stay in port elizabeth for a couple of nights on arrival mainly to relax before working for a couple of weeks and then do some of the garden route and on to cape town for some more activity after I have finished. i like kayaking hiking beaches socialising generally being outdoors.  Does anyone have any recommendations for where to stay and activities for these locations. I'm a solo traveller am active but not so young! so dont want to party the night away but be nice to have a social environment. Very happy to stay in a hostel or Hotel and any recommendations very much appreciated.  Although not on a complete budget sadly i dont have unlimited funds! but safety and a good nights sleep are top of the list!  Port Elizabeth - i'd like to be near the beach so can just relax after flight and recharge before work.  Garden Route - i might have limited time so may have to be choosy about where to stop?  If i have time i have seen the Baz Bus i could hop on on off - does anyone know anything about this?  Or fly to Cape Town and do tours from there?  Cape Town - If fly here to CT from port elizabeth then garden route activities/tours from CT plus table mountain some wine tasting and hotels/hostels?  Sorry for all the questions but thought would put it all in one. Any help or advice very gratefully received.  Safe travels all!  :) ,LR72,,"Brighton, United..."

Hi  I am coming to Kruger on a trip this April and plan to spend two days in the park staying overnight outside however (in Hazyview). I read that entrance 'tickets' can be booked for day visitors through the Sanparks online booking tool and that conservation fees can already be paid upfront such that no payment is outstanding on the day of the visit. My questions however:  - Can one just enter the park once this is booked and paid or does one still need to register at the gate office?  - Does it matter which gate one enters/leaves the park with these pre-paid entrances?  - Can one book for two days at once and does this simplify entry on the second day or does one need to do that day by day?

So I was initially planning a trip mid July. (Wanted to avoid SA school holidays)    Then a little research I noticed if we moved out dates into Aug we would get 30min later in the park as the gates close later. So I am now moving towards the first two weeks of Aug 2024.    However I now note this is considered High season where end of July was considered mid/peak season. (Lodge rates)    Now I still think Begining of Aug is the best time for us to go but am I missing something is it going to be packed with foreign tourists( ?) or is there merit to going mid end of July?

Hi help needed!  We previously did Cape Town Garden route and Kariega with kids aged 9/11. We want to return and my wife now wants to do Cape Town again but perhaps something different after that. What would be better for safari a different reserve in Eastern Cape Madikwe or KZN? Thinking of travelling in October (could be February if better). We prefer Malaria free (or almost free) and a wilder less managed and more authentic safari experience if possible within those parameters (ie: less zoo like without disrespecting those options which will suit others).  Thanks in advance ,2mbsy,,
Please can people share their experiences with regards to how many weeks/months their long term visa took to process. (we are a family of 4) We submitted ours through VFS Manchester and the tracking states it is with the SAHC in London however we need to travel to Italy and do not have passports. How long did your visa take to process? If you got your passport back from the SAHC for travel (some people have done this) did it delay your application? Any/all advice and experiences would be appreciated. ,Sharon T,,
Any epic or scenic restaurant recommendations along the way back from Madikwe game reserve to Johannesburg ? ,Jeff T,Madikwe Game Reserve,
Hi everyone    My husband and I are in the process of booking a trip to South Africa for early Novemver this year. We are trying to decide between Pillansberg and the East Cape to do a safari. I have a best friend who raves about Pillansberg my cousin as well who has been to the East Cape including to the Shamwari Game reserve which I think is definitely out of our budget.    We are looking for the best place to see animals and don't want to spend an arm and a leg but something nice in a Private Reserve. We are planning on 4 nights 3 days and will spend a week in Cape Town as well.    Also any accomodations you recommend?    Thank you for your help.

We arrive in CT at the end of September and have 7 full days. We are staying in an AirBnB 10 mins walk from V&A. We are a reasonably fit couple in our 60s. We would prefer not to hire a car (happy to use uber and hop on off/arranged trips) and have no plans to take in the wine areas as pretty as they look. We don't think we have the time to take in any safari type trips possibly something we will do on a return trip.    We plan to take in Table Mountain Robben Island the Blue mini peninsula tour (Hop on Hop Off) a Cape of Good Hope/Penguins full day tour Kirstenbosch Gardens Bo Kamp Woodstock Street District Six Museum the Waterfront. we also like to stroll around shops so have Canal Walk on our list too. We haven't yet built a detailed schedule as we understand the weather will determine when we can do some of these trips. As you can see we have a broad range of things to do but wondred if we had missed anything obvious?    In terms of food we enjoy fish over meat and would also like to try bobotie. On our list of restaurants to try are Karibu Pigalle Hussar Grill Osteria Tarantino and Millers Thumb. Any thoughts on this selection also welcome.    Finally we have a check out time on our departue date of 10 am but an evening flight. Any thoughts on a last day actvity would also be welcome. ,Ightham1,Cape Town,Ightham

Hello  Next October it will be my fisrt visit to Kruger National Park. I have already booked and paid for all the accommodations. I've just realized that I didn't consider well the time it will take to drive between camps... One of the days I will leave Crocodile Bridge Rest Camp towards Olifants Rest Camp. That's a lot of kilometers for a single day... Can you please give me some advice so that I can do this route without being in a hurry and be able to enjoy my self drive safari and at the same time manage to reach Olifants before they close the gate? All advice is welcome! ,Mi Nebet,Kruger National Park,Lisbon District...
I currently have a US based cell phone with Verizon. They have an international plan but it is expensive. T-Mobile has a better less expensive plan..I could switch carriers. I am also in the market for a phone upgrade so the phone would have the latest updates...iPhone. I have been told to look at eSIM (Holafly and Airalo )but it seems that it will not provide texting which is probably what I would need most to be in contact with my travel companion and private tour guide.

Hi    I would like your opinion on our itinerary after the changes. We will be in South Africa at the end of July-beginning of August for a family trip. We are now thinking of focusing on one region considering the weather in Cap Town at this time of year.    D1 Flight from Canada to Johannesburg. Arrival in the evening and overnight near the airport.  D2 Direction Blyde River Canyon night in Graskop or Blyde river canyon forever resort  D3 Private reserve (Naledi lodge Masodini game lodge Buffelshoek or Honeyguide-the latter is more expensive) Do you have any other suggestions for private reserves that are not too expensive?  D4 Private reserve  D5 Satara rest camp- which bungalow do you suggest booking?  D6 Lower sabie rest camp- which bungalow or tent would you suggest booking to be more secluded and increase the chance of seeing animals?  D7 Lower sabie rest camp  D8 Mlilwane sanctuary reserve or Mantengo lodge or other  D9 Mlilwane sanctuary reserve or Mantengo lodge or other  D9 Hluhluwe-Imfolozi night at Hilltop camp possibly  D10 Night in St Lucia  D11 Night in St Lucia  D12 Night at Aliwal Shoal for snorkeling with sharks  D13 Royal Natal possibly at Thendele camp  D14 Royal Natal possibly at Thendele camp  D15 Return to Johannesburg nuit à Johannesburg  D16 visit Soweto and evening flight    Here are my current questions:  Is it worth it to book a private reserve or the guide drives in the rest camps are good and we can therefore save money for our trip?    Should I remove a night in Kruger Park and add it to St-Lucia? If so what modification would you suggest for Kruger Park?    Am I better off removing the Drakensberg area and adding these 2 nights to my itinerary including one in St Lucia and flying from Durban to Johannesburg?    Any suggestions to add will be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot ,veroturmel,,"Montreal, Canada"
Hi I'll be in Cape Town with my sis and Mom in mid September I have friends who have travelled before to SA and we were informed that it's not a very safe place to visit. I apologise in advance and I hope this does not offend anyone but I'm just telling what I've been told. I'd appreciate if anyone can help me with my questions below.    I know not to walk in the dark or quiet areas. We will be staying around Cape Town City Centre is it safe for us to walk around? It'd be hard not to look like tourists because we're Asians... lol    Is Wise debit card widely used? We would prefer not to carry around too much cash for obvious reasons.    Should we book ahead or just order a taxi from airport to our hotel? If anyone can recommend any reliable taxi drivers I'd appreciate it. Are Uber drivers trustworthy and reliable?    Should we purchase the local SIM card at the airport? If yes would appreciate if there any good recommendations for best rates and coverage.    Is it safe to leave valuables in hotel?    Would appreciate any other tips or recommendations. Thank you! ,Stephanie,Cape Town Central,Petaling Jaya...

Our flight from Maun Botswanna to Cape Town through Johannesburg has a 2 hour connection. Both Airlink Flights on the same ticket. A couple of questions! Will the bags be able to be checked through to the final destination or do we need to collect and recheck them in at Johannesburg? And is 2 hours enough time from disembarking our flight in Terminal A exiting through customs to checking back into Terminal B departing to Cape Town? Does someone know the procedure we will be required to follow? ,Glendafay,Johannesburg,

Hello all    I'm travelling to SA with my girlfriend on the 27th August Cape Town and Kruger very excited!    My girlfriend is from Slovakia and requires a tourist visa (kind of random considering most EU countries don't!) ...It was a bit of an ordeal to get it but it finally came through last week. I'm from Ireland so no such hassle.    To our surprise the visa states a very specific 15 days which was the amount of time required in the original plans we submitted in the application. We were expecting a broader 30 days as my research indicated this is generally what is granted? We of course submitted fully refundable flights with the application knowing we'd cancel these flights due to the high cost as I'm sure most people do....kind of a silly process if you ask me.    So long story short the way our itinerary looks and to obtain much cheaper flights it would be 16 days in total I'm struggling to make it any shorter.    What would be the consequences if we try to leave after 16 days (it's 15 really but 16 including departure and arrival day)...Will there be any lenience? Should I not even think about it? If it's just a slap on the wrist and unlikely to be granted a visa again in the future I'll probably continue as planned....If it's going to cause heaps of stress then I will find a way to make it shorter.    Thanks in advance! ,sean m,,"London, United..."
Hi    We have booked 2 back to back tours - South Africa with Victoria Falls extension and a tour in Namibia  overall about 22 days in Africa from memory.    We will be completing our tours in Johannesburg.    Thinking we would love to stay on and possibly participate in another tour  possibly 5 to 7 days  maybe  open to suggestions.    We would like to make the most of our time in Africa and visit other places. Get some bang for our money seeing we are there so to speak.    What countries in Africa would you suggest we possibly visit that are not too far from Johannesburg?    Are there any tour companies you can recommend that can assist?    Had thought about these possible places - Mozambique Eswatini Botswana Lesotho ... where would you go and why?    Thanks in advance! ,Elaela,Johannesburg,"Melbourne, Australia"

Travel alert for tourists in Joburg! Has anyone else experienced this? After leaving the Apartheid Museum my wife and I got in our rental and hopped on the M1 on Friday 5/20/2022 around 1pm busy with many cars.    We were approached by a vehicle with two men trying to get our attention pointing to our windshield and desperately asking us to pull over. I was on high alert but also concerned something was wrong with my car and also not knowing if it was an official government vehicle—not being from here.    They were persistent! I tried to ignore them they pulled in front of us with their emergency lights and insisted we pull over so I did cautiously on the highway emergency lane. A man approach my window (locked doors & partially open window for safety) and tried to convince us to follow him to a garage just off the freeway so he can print our E-Toll charges (clearly seeing a toll device on our windshield). I was like hell naw this is is scam. He said if we don’t we might face arrest by police for 48 hours all this on the side of the freeway with lots of pressure from this persistent well dressed man carrying a radio in hand and an ‘I.d.’. I told him we won’t be following him but that I would call the police to clarify if he is legitimate at which point he said ok go.    We left shaken up wondering if he was following us and confused about the whole ordeal. We know he was a scammer/criminal preying on tourists and concluded that he must have followed us out of the Apartheid Museum Parking Lot there’s not other explanation for how they targeted us on a busy highway.    Some take a ways from our experience:    1) never pull over for non-police vehicles I did but very cautiously and in a very open space but wish I hadn’t all together.    2) if you’re caught off guard ask many questions and call the local authorities to ask for clarification if needed.    3) be aware that tourist attractions might be spots for people targeting you to rob and scam not sure what their intentions were but we said hell no thank you!    I’m sure Joburg is great some locals were disturbed that this happened to us and I’m just glad we stuck our ground. ,Joel Silva,Johannesburg,

Hi    Have been reading extensively especially on TA to plan our trip to Kruger next May. We'd like to spend 2 or 3 nights in a private lodge and will do the rest staying in SAN Parks locations.

Hi all  We are planning a trip to South Africa for 2 families (8 in total) for next June from USA. I am now looking at travel insurance options.

Hello everyone    I will be in Capetown in October and I wondered if it's safe to walk in the city? I am only planning a walk for small distances which would include the following (I am located at Hotel Sky which is located beside the CTICC):  - Walking from Hotel Sky to V&A Waterfront/Two Oceans Aquarium  - Walking from Hotel Sky to DHL-Football Stadium  - Walking from Hotel Sky to Boo Kaap    Also for some of this day activities I would like to wear a backpack with clothes to change or something similar. Is it safe to do so or do I need to be careful because a theft could happen?  All other distances (e.g. Table Mountain to the airport Lion's Head) I am planning to do by car with Uber.

Hi all    I'm planning my honeymoon for this coming December - includes Kruger Capetown & winelands.    My first question is regarding stays in Kruger. We've narrowed our options to 3 days through andBeyond in Phinda (Vlei or Rock Lodge) or Ngala Tented or a stay 4/pay 3 option through sabisabi.com at Selati camp/Little Bush Camp/Earth Lodge. Each Sabi stay is ~33% more expensive than the Phinda/Ngala stays. In your experience is this ~33% price difference (which represents about 13% of our total trip budget) worth it? Any other thoughts/pros/cons on these specific lodges in general?    My second question is about flights to/from Kruger. Can assume we're flying to Phinda. If we fly to/from Cape Town how long is that flight and is it direct? If not where is the stopover? What types of planes are used?  Same question but from Johannesburg - flight times direct type of plane on each leg?    Thanks all in advance! ,ronberger91,Kruger National Park,

We will have an opportunity to travel for about 2 weeks in South Africa this October which will be our first time there as well as our first time on safari. Our current plan is as follows:    2 days in Cape Town  2 days in Stellenbosch/Franschhoek  Possibly 1-2 days in Hermanus?  Fly to Nelspruit/Skukuza and pick up rental car  6 days/5 nights in Kruger (2 nights Satara 2 night Lower Sabie 1 night Skukuza?)  Drive back to JNB airport    At this point we wouldn't really be considering private game lodges as our wallets are very empty from a trip to the Maldives we just booked haha.    We know from experience that we have a tendency to try to cram in way too many spots when planning trips and we'd like some feedback from the community to see whether our current plan is doable or advisable. ,justonequestion,,"Santiago, Chile"
Planning a trip late September to SA and interested in the Earth lodge and sabi sand. This will be our first safari trip ever so looking for some well seasoned wisdom. The lodge and reserve look like an amazing experience but wanted to ask if anyone has experienced this lodge in particular? In doing some cursory research online we've seen a lot of pictures of elephants and other animals(leapords etc) coming up and into the private suite pools--and even a photo of an elephant walking on the roof of one of the suites. How have people felt about being in such close proximity to the wildlife while in your suite and without a guide present? ... in other words am I going to be in the outdoor shower and turn around to find a lion behind me 😅 ,divs17,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,"Bronx, New York"

We are going to Elephant Plains Sabi Sands in late September. Last year when in Botswana in June we wore very light weight down jackets when out on the river early morning/evening as the boats travelled pretty fast and it made it a little chilly. By no means cold. And at night shorts and shirts were more than warm enough for us sitting outside. We come from Scotland and are quite used to colder weather.  So for Elephant Plains I have seen some videos of people wearing a lot of clothes and just wondered how cold it actually gets and is our gear that we used in Botswana sufficent?  Also do we need to bring wet weather gear?  Thanks in advance. ,TheFatLaird,,"Inverness, United..."

my partner 23 year old daughter and myself are looking at going to South Africa next June to celebrate our 60th Birthdays very much looking forward to it so want to get as much out of it as we can. I have put together a rough itinerary nothing is booked yet so if you lovely people think we could change/add anything then its not at problem.    The rough itinerary i have for a 14 day trip is as follows with some empty days to fill.    Flying into Johannesburg from London (approx 11 hr flight) we land at 7am and was then planning on taking an internal flight later that morning to Skukuza in the Kruger national park planning on staying for 4 days mixing it with self driving a couple of organised safaris and a bush walk.    After 4 days was going to catch an internal flight from Skukuza to Cape town and then making our way to Gansbaai(unsure how we are getting here yet) to do the shark cage and hopefully see the whales. My daughter would really like to go to the penguin Ireland. we would also like to do some whitewater rafting and my partner would like to do a high bungee jump. As I say these are just thoughts and not sure if it is all doable as i probably don't appreciate the distance that is needed to travel to do all these things. Is there anything that we should not miss between all these places as I've got about 5/6 days to fill allowing to get back to Johannesburg for our flight home.    Thanks in advance ,LondonKlb,,london

Hey everyone 👋    I'm a solo traveler coming to Johannesburg next week for a transit of four days.    Please help me figure out the following:    1. Which mobile network provider offers the best coverage and the fastest speed in the city? How much does mobile data cost? Can I get their SIM card at Johannesburg International Airport (JNB)?    2. Which areas in the city would you recommend I base myself in if I'm not into touristy stuff and nightlife? A shopping mall or a city park for a walk nearby would be helpful.    3. Is there a bus/train from JNB to the city center? I'm not sure of my location in the city but one way or another I'll base myself somewhere closer to the CBD so a train/bus from the airport there would be awesome.    4. Are there any ride-sharing apps such as Uber or Bolt?    5. How widespread are card payments in South Africa? As this is just a stopover for me I'm not planning many activities while I'm there. Maybe Lion Park and Cradle Moon but I doubt I'll do more so I was wondering if it is possible to survive in Johannesburg for four not full days without exchanging or withdrawing cash and using only a foreign debit card.    I appreciate your help 🙏 ,Vytautas,,"Vilnius, Lithuania"

Hi! We're trying to figure out the best option for flights from Melbourne to Cape Town in Feb - any insight or recommendations would be wonderful!    To complicate things a bit we'll be travelling with a 2 year old and other family who are nervous travellers so it's a toss up between less long stints on a plane or less stops.    We'd ideally like to stop somewhere on the way back for a few days thinking maybe Singapore Maldives or Bali although none are really on the way.    Currently the top 2 options seem to be either:    1. Qatar: MEL - DOH - CPT (less stops but more total flight time. Not really interested in Doha as a stopover)    2. Qantas: MEL - SYD - JNB - CPT (less time on a plane and can fly from Avalon Airport which is closer to us but 14 hours is a LONG time to have a 2 year old on a plane!!).    I'm really hoping there's a third option we haven't found that's a compromise? Ideally we'd love MELB - [somewhere nice for a few days] - CAPE TOWN but we haven't found it yet.    Thanks! ,Laura M,,"Torquay, Australia"

Hi    We are planning a trip with our teenagers for the end of July-beginning of August 2024. We are clarifying our itinerary in order to be able to reserve our accommodation.I would be happy to have your accommodation recommendations according to my itinerary and considering the cold temperature at night. Is it necessary to have accommodations that have heating in the rooms?    We like to live new experiences while traveling and we never come back to travel in the same country so I would like to be able to see the favorites of the country.    D1 Arrival at the airport in the evening and night near the airport.    D2-D3 Blyde River Caynon  Do you have any accommodation to recommend. The view looks great at the Blyde canyon Forever resort but the accommodations seem outdated according to reviews. There is also the Zur Alten Mine in Graskop or the Blyde River Canyon lodge and Blyde River cabin. If not would you suggest sleeping at Hasyview further afield. Would one night be enough?    D4-D7 Safari Kruger Park  we would have liked to try a private reserve but the ones I see at Sabi Sand are too expensive over $1000 a night. Do you have a suggestion for a more reasonable price. I thought of sleeping 2 nights in a reserve or outside the park to have more comfort and 2 nights in the park in Satara or Lower Sabie camp to explore the north or the south depending on the choice of my other accommodation.    D8 Swaziland night at Mlilwane sanctuary    D9 Hluhluwe night at Rhino Ridge safari lodge or Hilltop camp seems good for seeing animals but accommodation seems poor.    D10-D11 St-Lucia maybe airbnb    Thereafter we hesitate to stay on the east coast to add 1 night at the Rhino ridge safari lodge stay 2 nights near the crocodile bridge at Crocrodile bridge safari resort in order to enjoy the kruger park more and 2-3 nights on the seaside either towards Kosi bay or thonga lodge for snorkeling or if you have other ideas rather than heading to Cape Town.    At the beginning of August is it possible to enjoy the sea or is it cold also on the east side? This will help me make a choice    Another option that allows you to visit a larger part of the country:    Cap 3 nights to hike see the penguins visit the museum and go paragliding at Lion's Head.    Hermanus 2 nights to cage dive with white sharks. It seems like a unique experience to do just in South Africa.    What is the best option?    Thanks for your opinion ,veroturmel,,"Montreal, Canada"

Hello!  We are a well-travelled Canadian couple in our early 40’s looking for adventure beaches wildlife and breweries/wineries ideally on a budget with the odd splurge for 2 weeks. We love the idea of renting a vehicle and doing everything ourselves. We’re currently looking at SA Namibia and Botswana but looks like SA would suite us more? We have already done Tanzania/Zanzibar/Kilimanjaro 10 years ago and loved it!  We are hoping some experts could point us in the right direction in our early stages of planning. I’d personally like to do a cage swim with great whites self-drive a safari with our rental and chill on some beautiful beaches (maybe surf??). We are also big hikers…so Cape Town looked good for this?  Am I correct to say SA would be the most practical option? Would something like Cape Town – Hermanus – Jeffery’s Bay – Kruger make sense? Too much driving for 2 weeks? Maybe fly out Johannesburg though not sure one-way rentals would be economical. Other ideas? Should we bend the budget and fly to Victoria falls?  Sorry for the vagueness going down this rabbit hole it seems every confusing decision is met with a dozen options. ,Littlechilds,,"Calgary, Canada"

Hi Everyone.    We are planning trip to Franschhoek in September. While searching for the hotel I seem to only find that the hotel with solar panel / generator do not have the secure gated parking. While the hotel that have gated parking do not have the solar panel. The hotel that have both are all booked out it seem.    I have not experience Load Shedding before so I do not know how much it is going to effect the stay. Consider September is still cold in Franschhoek perhaps it does not matter much? We are renting a Mercedez so honestly do not want to leave it outside on the street parking. Or it does not matter as Franschhoek seem to be very safe.    Appreciate any advise you could throw my way. Thank you. ,AmAme,Franschhoek,"Abu Dhabi, United..."

Hi All    Going to Kruger in December for 4 nights and struggling to make a decision. My partner and I decided we want to stay on a private reserve and are keen on a lodge. We started looking at Sabi but quickly got priced out other than Arathusa. Then we saw other reserves that are a bit cheaper and hope the safaris are still as good! we've never been on safari so doubt our expectations are very high anyways.    So think I've narrowed it down to a few (based on price and availability). If anyone could help / advise what they recommend on our list whether the lodge or the reserve is good (or even if the max budget options are worth the difference in price). That would be really helpful.    Arathusa - Sabi Sands (Max budget)  Senalala - Klaserie (Mid budget)  Naledi Lodge - Balule (Mid - low budget)  Baobab Ridge - Timbavati/Klaserie (low budget)    Thanks! ,Colin B,Kruger National Park,"London, United..."
Hello    in October I will arrive at JNB airport. I will rent a car to drive to Hazyview area and then I will stay there for a few days. Afterwards I will move on to Malalane and stay there a few more days. Then I will drive back to JNB airport. I would have planned the following routes:  -JNB to Hazyview: N12 & N4 until Mbombela then R40 to Hazyview  -Hazyview to Malalane: R40 to Mbombela then N4 to Malalane  -Malalane to JNB: N4 & N12    Are those routes the best choice? Are they safe for a tourist with a rental car? I will always drive during the day never at night and I will have some car like a Toyota Corolla so nothing that luxury. Do I need to take any other precautions?  I will have 2 big luggage pieces and 2 small ones I assume they all won't fit in the trunk so I may store them at the back seat - is this a problem?    Thank you for all your answers.  Best regards  Stefan ,Stefan S,,

Trip Report - 10 day trip around South Africa (Joburg Mpumalanga Kruger Pretoria Cape Town)    Background: Wasn't planning on writing this trip report but doing it for the friends who asked for it. We are a family of 4 with 2 kids who took this 10 day trip. South Africa is a life changing and a surreal experience a mixture of wildlife nature modern city life etc. making it a definite place to visit. One thing we didn’t plan on was the long flight and the jetlag. Fortunately it wasn’t that bad but you feel like hitting the bed at 8pm and you are up at 5am. Kinda works out overall.    Local SIM Card: While traveling especially while driving in another country I always purchase a local SIM card at the airport for peace of mind. I just discovered about the eSIM option on the new phones which don't have dual SIMs. You use the eSIM as a local data provider and use your phone as usual and also make Wi-Fi calls. We have T-Mobile Spectrum & Verizon in the family and the good news is all US providers worked there with roaming. Spectrum phone was free data/texts. I had gotten a 3G eSIM Prepaid service with 5G data and it worked flawlessly with coverage throughout the country including Kruger. You don't want to be driving around Kruger checking your phone anyway.    Forex: South Africa is almost a cash-free country. Even though you don't need local Rand in most places it’s good to withdraw cash at the airport for tips and other streetside vendors. I had first converted about 250USD which got used fully. Needed to get more for the last minute street shopping. You will need to bargain with the shoppers and start with a ridiculously low ball offer for the amount they want to sell it for.    Food and Water:  Food is a big part of any vacation and while in South Africa food is not an issue. Local South African food is yum! The food is mostly a variant of an Indian dish you are used to with a different name. Most hotels we stayed in had vegetarian breakfast (sans eggs) and the included dinner had SA options which is so close to Indian food with the usage of vegetables and spices. Gold Restaurant was definitely an experience you don't want to miss. A 14 course menu brought to your table with live music dance and drum lessons etc. was such an exciting experience. Also big cities have a huge Indian presence. Areas of Cape Town like Rylands has a ton of dhabas and if you wanted to try an upscale Indian restaurant in Cape Town Downtown head to Bukhara now called Awara. One of the best Indian food in the country. Their bathroom doors are original teak wood doors from a haveli in India. Also water salads ice etc. is completely safe. We stuck to bottled water to be safe and did not any health issues anywhere in the country. Food and hotels are pretty cheap. There is a place called Mojo Market at Sea Point which had live music daily with like 30 food stalls ranging from Sushi to Malay to Indian and everything in between. Amazing place and very reasonable.    Airlines & GPS: We flew KLM to Joburg and South African Airlink from Joburg to CT. Airlink was one of the classiest airlines with gourmet food drinks and first class service. On using GPS for the road trips. In SA with the phone coverage Google maps is more than enough. You don't need a separate Garmin device and you get good phone coverage throughout. We were surprised that we never had to use the Garmin.    Clothing:  Michigan summer is winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Google weather was wrong where it said 60s in Cape Town and 90s in Kruger. It was around 60s mostly throughout the country and Kruger nights actually got to be in the 40s. Have a waterproof jacket in summer and most days were around 60 with a few days reaching 70.    Car Rental + Weather + Insurance:  We rented a car only in Cape Town. I got a small Toyota stick shift which worked out well. You need to be experienced with driving on the opposite side on a stick shift and in smaller roads. Cape Town throws in a wrench where the city is built on a mountain and roads are hilly with several stop signs right on top of the hill.  Get a small car or a mini SUV to its easy to park in tight spots. Car rentals are cheap - around $35/day and get the extra insurance for peace of mind. I had booked through Hertz downtown location. They checked the car for the smallest scratches possible. I had some rim damage from parking too close to the curb and was charged $60 repair fee. As usual do not speed while in another country. You don't want the extra hassle of dealing with the SA cops and corruption is prevalent.    Attractions: South Africa is full of natural attractions. Cape Town is one of the most beautiful cities IMHO. It's cosmopolitan city which felt like you are in Miami Beach which is also near Hawaii and Iceland all rolled into one. And if you are into animals and nature Kruger is an experience of a lifetime. Even though you can drive within the park yourself you need to be very experienced and need a different kind of vehicle to off road. We went though a safari company and it's a 12hr safari and we did it two days back to back. Definitely recommend both days as it's a different experience. You are guaranteed to see the Big 5 and maybe the little 5 but the different days provide a different experience. The first day we saw a dozen lions attacking a herd of cape buffalos and the second day we saw a kill firsthand. It was like the things you see on National Geographic only live and up-close. Even non animal lovers would be awestruck at seeing nature at it's finest. And Kruger is different experience than Serengeti or Okavango(!) it is very much accessible and luxurious. There are classy restaurants and watering holes within a short drive for breaks.    Finally - our POIs:  For our trip we visited Joburg Pretoria Mpumalanga Kruger Cape Town. You need at least a week in Cape Town to visit all the attractions. The drives around town and the beaches were amazing. Chapmans peak is one of the most picturesque and the best drives in the world. Our small Toyota made the climb without issues. We took the hop on hop off bus at CT the first day. It takes you around all the attractions but the bus comes once every 30mins and you waste a lot of time waiting. Glad that we rented the car the next day. You can do the Cape Peninsula tour very easily yourself and take your own time if you have a rental car. Several beaches and free areas to see the Penguins. If you are renting do not drive after 6pm when it gets dark there is load-shedding and several places without power and you could take Uber which is very cheap. Also we took a package tour bus from Joburg to Kruger and Mpumalanga as it's a long drive through the countryside and villages. We stayed inside the Kruger Park at an all inclusive resort. It was a wonderful experience listening to wild animals at night and having Cape Buffalos Kudus and Impalas in your backyard. The management said that lions do not prefer coming near the area and we kind of trusted them. You could also visit the local town of Hazyview while you are there which is not touristy to experience the local African lifestyle. Few things I would have done differently would have been visit the nearby countries of Swaziland Lesotho and Mozambique while we were there. We were so close to all these countries and with some better planning could have added 3 more countries to our list. ,jokerji,,"Ann Arbor, Michigan"

We have the wine tram booked for tomorrow. I got an email conformation at 4:58pm for the car collecting us at 9am in the morning and then 3 mins later got an email from the wine team telling me its all cancelled tomorrow due to escalation of trouble relating to taxi dispute. I can't ring them as they're now closed and don't know whether to get up in the morning for the transfer or not.    I've emailed everyone back and clearly they've now shut for the day. I'm absolutely gutted was looking forward to this and have been planning for months.    I don't know why they decided to email everyone a minute after they've closed that's really annoying. I understand these things happen but am a bit annoyed they didn't tell us earlier so I could arrange a backup.

Hello    Does anyone have any experience of flight prices for Cape Town to Victoria Falls with Airlink. I’m looking at January and on our dates they re sitting at over 27000 zar for 2 which is far higher than Kenya Airways. Any chance of them going down? I’m getting a bit nervous and considering paying the high price 😩. The Kenya Αirways flights don’t work date wise unfortunately    Thanks all. ,Suzanne C,Cape Town,"Suffolk, United..."
Hi all - hoping I can get some help in making a safari experience decision!    I'll be heading to Capetown to meet with a friend for a holiday in February - but was thinking to stop off in Johannesburg for a short 3 day safari. I have been split between Madikwe or Sabi Sands. Sabi Sands tends to have better reviews and is a little more expensive but I wouldn't mind the extra cost if it's worth it...    ...the main concern I have is going in February - realising this is isn't the best time for visibility and seeing the animals. A travel agent actually said it wouldn't be very good in February but I think she was trying to oversell me for something else.    So my questions are firstly is it worth doing in February at all and secondly is there much difference in the two reserves? I haven't been on a safari before!  Thank you! ,Harman M,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,

My husband and I have decided to do a safari next year for our anniversary and I’ve been researching for weeks as to what to do and where to go. My husband doesn’t want to spend long periods of time in a bus getting to the reserves so I’m thinking of maybe flying to Kruger national park and maybe doing a 5 day safari ? I’m not sure where the best area to stay our budget will be roughly around R22000 per person. We are thinking of going around either March or April  any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you. ,S Smith,Kruger National Park,Blue Mountains...
Trying to plan a family vacation - husband kids 18 and 21. I think we want to stay on a private game reserve as we do not feel comfortable doing self drive.

Is it worth staying a night or more in Hermanus? And how about Muizenberg?    I have 8 nights between safari and volunteer work. During the 8 nights I want to se Cape Town Muizenberg and Hermanus. Should I do day trips from Cape Town or stay some nights in Muizenberg and Hermanus?    Anyone know a good whale watching company/ boat tour in Hermanus? Preferably a smaller intimate and exclusive one.  Thanks in advance! 🤗 ,Elin S,Hermanus,

Hi    I'm planning to visit in September but would like to hear some options first before booking the air ticket (solo female 1st visit to South Africa):    Cape town : 4 nights - plan to buy the 3 days HOHO mega pass (I've not really checked what is included but it seems like some entrance fees are included too?) and use it for the 3 full days that I'll be there. However I'm wondering if I should allocate a night or two for Hermanus do a day trip from cape town or skip it altogether.    Kruger National Park: 3 nights - fly in to Skukuza and stay in an all inclusive throughout. Kruger Shalati looks nice but I'm wondering if there's anything similar that's not too expensive:)    Johannesburg: 3 nights - same as cape town I plan to buy the HOHO bus for the 2 full days that I'm there.    Need to know if HOHO bus is good or I'm better off joining day tours with a local agent and if I should extend my stay for Hermanus.    Thanks! ,GoddessEneri,,Johor Bahru
Hi there    I am considering to at least temporarily move to Cape Town and am looking for affordable car rental options (the rates of the companies I usually used when just vacating like Avis Hertz etc are simply too high at the moment; plus they seem to make it their standard business to try and rip you off with bogus charges once you have left the country).    During my research I found two companies recommended by ex-pats: RentACheapie and MotoRent and I must say the rates they publish on their websites look promising. I have contacted them to inquire about the fine print of their insurance policies but I would obviously like to know if anybody has rented with these companies before and might want to share their experiences and thoughts.    thanks ,olivernorwellhardy,Cape Town,"Cologne, Germany"

Hi there    I'm after a bit more advice from you lovely people. Having spent ages reading up on which areas/roads/waterholes we want to visit I've drawn up a rough itinerary. I know that what we actually do when we arrive may well change depending on weather how we feel recent sighting reports etc. But I am a planner so at least want to start out with a rough plan!    Decided to spend time at a private reserve first before then doing self-drive as thought we would likely pick up some good tips from the rangers that way. We don't mind moving around we almost always have holidays where we have 2 or 3 nights in each place so are used to how that feels.    Anyway does the below seem not only feasible but enjoyable don't want to feel we are rushing at all! I've tried to base it on the TA advice and SANParks pages that say to assume around 25 km per hour is comfortable including animal viewing time.    Also my plan currently has 9 nights around Kruger (3 private reserve 6 in SanParks) most people seem to stay for less than that looking at other threads it's not too long is it? I can't imagine we'll be bored of seeing the animals.    Day 1 - land Joburg 7am fly to Hoedspruit Eastgate transfer to Bateleur (Timbavati) in time for afternoon game drive. Spend 3 nights here.    Day 4 - drive to Satara. Later in day stop by Girivana watering hole and drive along S100 and back. Spend 2 nights at Satara Rest Camp.    Day 5 - no real plan see what we feel like around Satara area    Day 6 - Drive to Skukuza via H1-3 then H1-2. Spend 2 nights at Skukuza Rest Camp.    Day 7 - no real plan see where we feel like driving around Skukuza area.    Day 8 - drive to Lower Sabie then Crocodile Bridge via Randspruit Road and Duke's Watering Hole. Visit Hippo Pools later on. Spend 2 nights at Crocodile Bridge Rest Camp.    Day 9 - Hippo pools again (we love hippos!) drive Nhlowa Road. See what else we feel like visiting.    Day 10 - slightly undecided but would like some beach time although don't want to fly miles away and we need to fly home from Joburg. So currently thinking drive the 1.5 hours to Kruger Mpugulanga Airport and fly to Vilanculos find nice hotel or AirBnB on the beach.    Day 15 - fly back from Vilanculos to Johannesburg (day prior to UK flight in case of any delays)    Day 16 - fly back from Joburg to UK. ,garstanggirl,Kruger National Park,"England, United..."
With so many safaris operating out of Johannesburg is it absolutely necessary to book a package months and months in advance?    I'm keen on the idea of staying at the mid-range Baltute private reserve in central Kruger.    I understand it's a quieter time of the year that falls outside side of school holidays when you're less likely to see other tourists like me around every bend.    I'm no economist but I'm guessing safari operators would quickly resort to offering hefty discounts if they couldn't fill their gameviewers or if the resorts they ferried their guests to found themselves with too many empty beds.    Could a lob-up-and-shop approach work out cheaper? ,John P,,"Sydney, Australia"

I'm travelling to Cape Town on April 27th with my adult daughter. It's a bit of a spur of the moment trip - she has a conference in South Africa and is taking time off following it. We are trying to decide where to stay in Cape Town. We keep hearing that we should stay at the V & A waterfront for safety but I get the sense that it is very touristy which is not our vibe. I 've also heard Camps Bay is nice. We are foodies and most of the restaurants we want to visit are not in the V & A area but scattered around the town. Any recommendations on a moderately priced place to stay and still enjoy walking or should we just stay and V & A and take Ubers. ,Treesamia76,Cape Town,"Newtown, Connecticut"

Hi  I am always suspicious when menu does nothave mililiters indicated.  When I am at home I can guess what are the amounts based on the country traditions.  What are the typical sizes in South Africa?    Here for example:  https://i.imgur.com/V0HAtgJ.jpg    Where it says Drafts - should I assume all are 500ml? Or could they present 400ml or even 330 drafts?  Where it says Beers - should I assume 330 ml bottles? Or could some be smaller or bigger?  About hard liquor (tequila etc) - is the typical size 40 ml? 30 ml? Or even less?    Whenever I see not marked sizes I always think they are smaller and that is what they want to hide :)    Thanks ,lurkerbudurker,,lurker
Good Morning Everyone    Hopefully we will be arriving in Cape Town on Friday 15 July & heading straight to Hermanus for a couple of nights . Just wondering whether the whales have arrived yet & if they are visible from land? I don’t do well in boats 🤮🤣    Also is it possible to see dolphins from land? We have a car and are willing to drive further along the coastline to see them.    Thanks so much for any updates. I’m sure we will have a great time even if it’s a bit early for the whales.

I have searched the forums but don't see a similar question having been asked.    We have only just received our itinerary from the agent (we are flying in about a week) and it looks like we are flying on Federal Airlines on a charter from Jo'burg to the reserve. I am looking on the FA website (https://www.fedair.com/about-us/baggage) and see that there are size limits to the duffle.    We are a bit panicked as we are flying onward to another holiday (which has different packing needs) and don't think we can get everything into a bag that's only two feet long! Are they strict about the size limit or is it mainly about the 20kg weight? Most of what we need to bring is soft clothing so we'll be fine for weight but not for that size!

I first visited with friends and did the garden route. Then with my partner for Kruger and Durban. Since then I’ve returned every year alone. I adore the place. Sometimes I do a beach trip/wine tour but mostly I go for safari.    Despite trying other places (Namibia Kenya south east Asia Costa Rica etc) I just crave SA. Even after a very similar trip to Namibia I ended up missing SA so much I changed my flights to add it on at the end.    I just love it. As a solo female I appreciate the ease with which I can get around and do my own thing - the autonomy of just hiring a car and getting on with it. Spending magical moments alone amongst wildlife is such a tonic.    BUT I do keep hearing ‘life’s too short to not try somewhere new’ so with that in mind has anywhere blown you away/been preferable to SA? ,Elele,,"Liverpool, United..."

Our family of five will be renting a vehicle twice this August (5 days JNB for KNP self-drive and then 5 days CPT to George Airport). Despite lots of research I am still confused on what insurance options vehicle type and company we should go with and would welcome advice.    1. My Capital One Venture X card and Ink Business Preferred card both provide primary insurance for rental cars up to $75000USD and up to 31 days in SA but specify that renter must decline rental company CDW for the policy to be valid. So should I decline both the Standard Waiver that seems to come with most rentals (if that is possible) as well as the Super Waiver option that seems to usually be an extra 1000 ZAR or so? Or should I take one of them anyway and not use the credit card insurance?    2. We want a large vehicle with automatic transmission particularly for our KNP self-drive and since we have three tall boys aged 17 14& 10. Mercedes Vito VW Kombi and Toyota Fortuner seem to be the most common options with Vito/Kombi usually a bit cheaper or the same price as 2WD Fortuner. I assume the Vito/Kombi have more interior room and Fortuner will ride a bit higher but will one be particularly better than the others for our long game drives?    3. AroundAboutCars has the best price I have found on Thrifty Vito-type rentals in both locations. But they require full pre-pay so I want to be sure about insurance and vehicle options before deciding and since I always book direct in North America rather than using a broker. Avis and Hertz seem to have the cheapest pay-later options but are. 4000ZAR+ more expensive. I like that Avis has an office in Skukuza in case of any Kruger issues and I have top-tier status with Avis/Hertz but am unclear if that is worth anything in this situation. DriveSouthAfrica could not find suitable large vehicles for our dates.    Thanks in advance for your help! ,PRS1,,"Crozet, Virginia"

I am looking at the possibility of either South Africa or Kenya for a multi-generational family trip (that includes 2 sets of grandparents in their mid-late 70s kids ages 11 and 13 and me my husband & brother - total of 7 adults and 2 kids).    Interest - safari animals culture/history  Duration - 2 weeks including travel (grandparents will join from India while we will join from USA)  Cost - mid-range (neither camping nor luxury)  Diet - vegetarian (preferably a few (not all) Indian meals availability for grandparents); rest of us eat eggs and other cuisines.    We will need to plan such that we have a couple of days rest after landing and again after safari has ended just before traveling back. This would give grandparents some time to relax before & after travel and also provide some family time).    How does South Africa compare to Kenya in terms of safari cost and experience? And which is a better choice considering travel with senior citizens? Looking forward for some feedback ideas and recommendations.    Is booking through a tour operator the best way to go about this? Is Kruger the best choice or are there other private game reserves?    The timing I have on my mind is March 16 - April 1 2024 (spring break for kids). Is it a good time to go? If not when else is a good time (prefer shoulder season for low crowds and reasonable travel cost). ,PRP,,

My research has somewhat narrowed it between Bush Lodge and Kirkman’s Kamp but open to other options I may have missed. We are looking to stay 3-4 nights and would like to keep the budget around $10k USD or less for the full stay.    What would be the major differences in staying at these two properties?

Thank you very much of all the posters here. Your info was very helpful.    I usually do trip planning on my own but I needed someone that has personal knowledge of the different reserves lodges and experiences so I used Tanya from Africa Direct. She has personally been to all the lodges as she’s located in South Africa.    Had a great experience in all the lodges I stayed in. Just wanted to experience different safaris. In all 3 I did the morning and evening game drives. Will give a very brief rundown of what I did.    Landed in Johannesburg. Went into town to eat. Stayed in airport hotel.    Morning flew to Skukuza stayed in Dulini River Lodge. Next day transferred to Serrondella Lodge. Stayed there 2 days.    Then Flew From Hodespruit to CapeTown on Friday. Saturdayw walked at Seapoint promenade.    Sunday. Did the Peninsula tour Seal island boat tour Chapman’s peak Cape pf good Hope Cape Point Boulder’s beach Muizenberg and Camps Bay for Sundown. Had rain first few hours then it cleared up.    Monday did local stuff Castle of Good Hope Robben Island beautiful Table Mountain and Signal Hill for Sunset. Visited V&A Waterfront in evening.    Tuesday morning flew to Wilderness Qorokwe in Okavango Delta in Botswana. Besides the game drive I also did a guided walk and the Mokoro (canoe) driven by polers on the Delta. Stayed there 2 days and then flew home via Johannesburg.    Was a very magical and luxurious experience. ,278JohnS,,"New York City, New..."

I know there are millions of questions and information about the safety issue of South Africa. But most of them are related to touristic trips. I could not find much info for business trip. I'm planning to start from Cape Town and drive approx 6500 km. I kindly request clear answers and suggestions from South Africans and people who lives there. Should I make this trip or not?    Let me give all the details for more accurate suggestions.    There are 25 companies in my visit list. they are located in 16 different cities or townships. Now I and my managers are doubtful undecided if i should take risk or not.  I live in Turkey White person. I'm gonna rent a Toyota Rav4 drive approx 6500 km starting from Cape Town passing southern shore till Durban then moving to the North. People suggest me to avoid Johannesburg but It's impossible. Most of the companies are around Johannesburg. Generally in outskirts or townships (Agricultural machinery and spare parts sellers.) That's why sometimes I have to drive on sideroads. I'll end up in Cape Town and fly back to my home if I'm not killed. Btw I didnt mention the touristical side of the trip because all you know.

Hi All - we are a family of 4 and planning 9-day SA trip in the end of Dec 2023. I am kind of lost and not sure where to start. We are flying into Cape Town and flying out from Johannesburg. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Also can I get recommendations for a travel agent who can help with planning? Thanks everyone - Shruti ,Shruti G,,San Francisco...
We're planning to fly from Jo'burg early on the 1st of April. The plan is for our family (7 adults needing 3 bedrooms) to do a few safari trips before flying out to Capetown/George.    Essentially since the time is so short we'd like to be ideally situated near a gate (or within 30 mins drive) so we can do a morning/evening safari. We obviously don't want to have to drive too far from the Airport (a little bit is ok) but need to look at the best areas to stay.    In terms of accomodations we're open - like I said 7 adults with 3 (or 4) bedrooms on a medium budget not lux not budget (something like $300-500 USd per room per night) or even a larger villa for all. Ideally we want all meals included with game drives as extra (2 full days as game drives).    Does anyone have suggestions of areas to look within there's just so many areas we're trying to narrow it down thanks. ,Jay,Kruger National Park,"Melbourne, Australia"
Can anyone recommend a good wine shop near the Durban Cruise Terminal preferably in walking distance but a short taxi ride would be OK? We are stopping on a cruise in February and would like to acquire some quality SA wines to enjoy on board. Paying for top notch wines in SA will be a lot cheaper than similar wines on board. ,Jim M,Durban,"Sudbury, Canada"
I am dreaming/planning a trip to western Africa arriving at Tambo Intl airport. The only information I have found ( via AAA) is a tour company called Alexander+Roberts .

Would this be advisable for a 70 something lady travelling alone ?  Appreciate any advise you may offer. ,chaletswiss,Johannesburg,"Arlington, Texas"

We want to explore the Kruger Park with our rental car. We have booked a hotel one hour drive from Orpen Gate only the earliest possible check out time is 06:00 AM which means we will arrive at Orpen Gate at 07:00 AM at the earliest. Is this a problem since I read in many blogs that you really need to be there at 06:00 AM. Perhaps good to know: we have booked an overnight stay for that night in the Kruger Park (Satara rest camp).    Thanks for helping us out! ,Lauri D,Kruger National Park,"Enschede, The..."

When we have traveled to some other cities we have taken advantage of free tip-based tours as a way to get an overview of a particular area.

Hi Everyone    I’m hoping you will be able me. We have just booked LRVST2 Do I need to request a specific tent number to try and get one with the best view? I’ve looked at the camp map and can’t see this labelled or are they the same as the LST2 tents?

We are considering a trip to Capetown but have some questions. Safety is always a concern but I can see that it’s relatively safe in certain areas during the day and that we shouldn’t venture out on foot at night - best to Uber to our destination. My question is where to stay - is Constantia safe and is it possible to get to Capetown easily from here? Also we’re considering visiting in April - is this a good month to visit? Ideally we want to avoid any months that are cold and/or rainy. Thanks ,CMG194,Cape Town Central,"Wishaw, United..."
Looking for some advice on itinerary please. We are planning 3 week trip in Jan 2024. We’d like to do garden route (husband not been to SA before) and end the trip with some remote beach time for snorkelling/poss diving.

We then want to work out how best to get to Thonga Beach lodge… Fly back to UK from J’burg after meeting friends. We can fly into Cape Town.    Is this doable over 21 days or so?

My boyfriend and I (26 and 27) are visiting Cape Town for the first time at the beginning of November. I'm looking for recommendations on which area would be the best for us to stay? I have been looking at Sea Point Green Point De Waterkant and the Gardens. We want to be in an area that is super walkable and can easily walk to restaurants for dinner and get drinks as well. We'll have a car to explore different areas but would prefer to be based somewhere that we don't have to worry about drinking and driving mostly in the evenings. I've read that both De Waterkant and the Gardens have great choices for food and are very walkable but possibly Sea Point and Green Point have better views and access to the beach? ,Tori P,Cape Town,

We have always been DIY self-book self-drive (or public transit) travelers but for the Kruger part of a 2024 trip I am wondering if we should enlist help. We plan to visit Cape Town and some wineries for 5 or 6 days. So far I don't see any reason we can't take care of that part ourselves.    For the greater Kruger area we would like to visit for 6 days or so possibly staying in 2 lodges including one in a private reserve like Sabi Sands. How do the agencies work? Do you pay significantly more if you use them (would make sense) or do they have access through their connections to better rates with lodges and transfer services? Do they own lodges and place you in their own?    Any comments on Go2Africa or &Beyond or others?    Thanks! ,Martin S,,

Hello    We arrive into CPT at 12pm and have the rest of this day the whole of the next day and up until say 11am the following day before joining a cruise. We then have 2 full days when the cruise gets back into Cape Town docked at V&A. The first days are the start for us of nearly a month in Africa and I am looking at booking Vineyards Hotel as I think we are going to need some down time when we arrive. We also have a final day and a half at Camps Bay before we fly home.    I really need your help in deciding if the hotel will work for us and in what order we should look to do the things we want to cover bearing in mind that the last two days we will be docked at V&A. I’m trying to find the most fluid and workable way of seeing what we want to see.

Can anyone recommend a car hire company that will deliver to our hotel ( Marriott Waterfront ) ? ,diane1Cheshire,Cape Town,"Sandbach, United..."
Hi we’ve booked a hire car through http://budget.co.za for our trip. We’ve never hired a car through a big company before only ever done it in Ireland via small companies who just hand over the car once you pay. Haha.    Looking for some explanation/advice on all the different extras and waivers and charges. Are there any that are worth getting? We’ve included roadside assistance already but I’ve read that they’ll try to sell us other extra things at the desk. I’m looking at getting separate excess insurance how much do they typically pre-charge to a credit card? I’m slightly concerned I won’t have a big enough limit on mine as it was saying 30k zar for each?    Also do we need any extra documents coming from the uk or is driving license and passport enough?    Sorry if this all seems a bit stupid but I’ve read the information the hire company gave us and I just don’t really understand what charges are optional.    Thanks :) ,Sarah R,,Manchester
Hello    We are beginning to plan for a 2024 trip that will include the Cape Town area and Kruger. Our windows to travel are either late May or August. I know it will be winter weather in CT cool and potentially rainy. My question is about optimizing Kruger. We will probably spend a few nights each in a couple of lodges. We are a family of 4 the kids are adults.    Which of the two options are a better choice considering these three priorities: mammal sightings malaria risk overall weather experience.    Thanks  Martin ,Martin S,,
From what I understand the Carlton Centre observation deck has been closed since the COVID-19 shutdown in March 2020 and there has been an article published saying that the deck is scheduled to reopen later in 2023. It appears that Google says that the Top of Africa deck has reopened but some sites say the deck is still closed. So does anyone here know if the observation deck of the Carlton Centre has reopened yet. ,Try2,Johannesburg,

Hi all after months of reading on thuis forum my girlfriend and I have scheduled a rough itinerary for our visit next August/September. We have not made any bookings yet since my vacation request from work hasn't been officially granted yet so we are still flexible. We are planning 2.5 weeks flying in on Wednesday and leaving two weeks later on a Saturday. Roughly our plans look like this at the moment:    -Day flight into JNB arriving at 21:00 and stay in the airport hotel overnight  -Flying in to Richards bay the next day rent a car and drive to st Lucia  -spend 3 full days in st Lucia to unwind visit the beach Hluluwe and iSimangaliso  -drive to eSwatinini and spend two full days in Hlane and Mlilwane  -spend the morning in Mlilwane and drive to Malalane for one night  -spend 4-5 days in Kruger combining self drives morning walks/drives sunset drives. No fixed plans yet for rest plans but we would like to go from South to North with either Satara or Olifants as the most Northern camp.  -Spend 3-4 days in a lodge just outside Kruger currently thinking about Thornhill since it is quite affordable compared to other lodges and the reviews appear nice.  - Drop off the car at Hoedspruit airport at the final day fly to JNB and take the late night flight (23:00) home.    We really would like to fit the Panorama route in our schedule as well. We noticed that Thornhill offers it as a day trip but when plotting it in Google Maps it says 350km in about 5 hours non-stop driving. Is this doable given that we will also spend time outside the car for admiring the scenery? Or does anyone has a better solution how to incorporate this route in our itinerary?    Other tips on our plans are also welcome of course :) ,erikkie39,Kruger National Park,"The Hague, The..."

We're leaving in 3 weeks and just sorting out final pieces of our itinerary. We will have a few days on safari and need to check out of there at 11am then we don't have to be anywhere until we need to drop the car hire back at PE airport at 6pm.    Does anyone have any recommendations of what we could do for a few hours? We will have had a filling breakfast before leaving safari but might want to get some food before dropping car back so will leave a couple of hours for that and it's just over an hours drive from the safari to PE so I estimate we'll have about 4 hours. ,lc2blt,,"Leeds, United..."

Dear all    We are planning the dive trip in Umkamas in September. After the dive we will pick up the car from AVIS Amanzimtoti and drive on N2 to Port Elizabeth (Shamwari) with the stop overnight at Mthatha.    I read that some of the part of this road is extremely dangerous especially from Kokstat to East London and one of the site called it highway to hell. However the article is quite old so I would like to ask if it is still that bad. I saw many said to watch out for Animals on the road. What kind of animal are we talking about here?    We choose to drive because we are not allowed to fly 24 hours after the dive so we will basically lose one day. This is our second trip in SA and we were driving garden route in the previous trip.    Thank you for your advise. ,AmAme,KwaZulu-Natal,"Abu Dhabi, United..."

The only way I have found it to work with the flight times from Johannesburg to Mauritius is to fly into MQP. Does anyone have any recommendations on where to stay in Kruger ideally we don't want transfer time from MQP to be longer than an hour and a halves drive. We are on a bit of a budget but still want to stay somewhere 'luxurious'. A few of the accommodations I have found have an option for full board including game drives which would be ideal but also open to Half board with Game drives optional to book ,Amel12,,

Day 3; Fly Jo'Burg to Nelspruit. Arrive at Kruger international airport by 8 AM. Rent a car. Self drive Safari in the park whole day. Sleep at SleepOver Orpen Gate.  Question: Can you please suggest a good 8 hour self-drive safari route from the airport to Orpen gate via the park? Also a good Lunch restaurant in side the park that falls on the route?

Or there areas we need to avoid?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Leg 2 - Addo/ Garden route    Day 8: Visit Addo park whole day. Leave around 16:00 to Plettenberg bay. Sleep at Keurboomstrand.  Question: Whats the best way to crack the Addo park visit in one day from 8 AM to 4 PM ? Self drive or guided game drives?

Day 15: Cape Peninsula Muizenberg Boulders bay penguins Cape of good hope. Sleep at Hilton Cape Town  Day 16: Bo Kaap Table mountain Chapman’s peak. Sleep at Hilton Cape Town  Day 17: Robben island V&A Waterfront other places. Fly back home via late night flight at 23:00.

Apart from that Did this cover enough essentials of Cape Town?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  In general whats your read in this itinerary? My hope is that the way we are pacing it doesn't make it too rushed and we are very happy to skip some attractions on any given day. Thanks again.    Best Regards  Vignesh ,Vignesh,,"Hilversum, The..."
Hello!    I am visiting Africa for the first time in January. The plan was to do 3 days in Kruger National park and 5 days Cape Town before heading back to the states.    However I just got affected by my company’s layoffs so I’m hoping to extend!! As a young (28) female solo traveler with a luggage full of summer clothes (coming off of 6 weeks in Southeast Asia)- I’m not sure exactly what to do or where to go.    I LOVE animals and nature so I’d really love to explore that part of Africa. At this point I’ve looked into some volunteer options- sea turtle conservation in Zanzibar or animal conservation in Victoria Falls. Do you recommend one over the other? Or a different one altogether? I’m pretty easygoing- I’d just love to take advantage of this lay off and opportunity to see more of Africa in a safe matter.    If you have any suggestions on which experience world he better or a must-see location or experience that would be safe for a solo traveler please let me know!! I’m really open to any and all suggestions but I do realize I’m on somewhat of a dime crunch.    Thank you! ,Sarah,,"Geneva, Switzerland"
Hi    We are travelling to SA 28 July for 2 weeks. Myself my husband and our three young adults 171921 yr. We have rented a non 4x4 RV in Joburg and are planning a triangle. joburg to Kruger through Eswatini back to Joburg. We are campers who have travelled in Africa many years ago (pre kids).    I have a few questions on our itinerary which is as follows:  Joburg to Kruger - 4 nights in Kruger - all booked  Kruger to Eswatini probably Mbabane - stay 1 night in Mlilwane - do canopy tour and some craft villages - possibly the luju festival  stay 1 night at lidwala lodge camp ground  go to St Lucia 2 nights - whale watching ? diving  possibly go up to Sodwana Bay to dive 2 nights  Down to Durban 1 night  to joburg via Drakensberg mountains possibly 2 nights    My questions  Does this look too ambitious - too much driving  How do we sort out a Braii in Kruger - we have walks and ranger drives booked as well as our own self drive in the Rv - staying at berg en dal satara and crocodile bridge rest  Can we whale watch in beg of Aug in St Lucia  Can we dive in St Lucia - we are all Padi qualified  If we can dive in St Lucia is it worth going to Sodwana Bay  Is Durban worth a stop - wanted to do one city but not sure what we are gaining  Is Drakensberg's in winter worth going off route for. We like hiking.    We are camping in an RV which is hired from Maui - should we pre book campsites or are we able to be a little flexible. Our kids are travellers who are ok with a non planned approach.    Anything else we should fit in/drop off  Anything else we should know    We are joint british/american citizens    Many thanks for your help. Very excited to be coming back to somewhere I spent a number of weeks in when I was 18 and sharing this with my kids. ,845philippap,,"Charleston, South..."

Hi  We (my husband and I) leave for SA with our three teenage kids (171921) for 2 weeks on 28 July.  We have an itinerary  4 nights in Kruger - booked  We haven't booked anything else yet  The plan is  Go down to Eswatini via the Jeppee Reef Border post  Stay around Mbabane Probably in Mlilwane 1 night do ziplining  Stay Lidwala lodge 1 night  Travel to Sodwana and do some diving 2 nights  Travel to St Lucia whale watching 2 nights  Possibly travel to Durban and back to Joburg via the Drakensberg mountains we need to be back for 13 aug  We are used to travel enjoy camping and have kids that are flexible. However we only have a short amount of time. Should I be booking campsites before we set off?  Is this itinerary too much?  We all dive and would like to dive. Can we do this in St Lucia with the whale watching and spend a little more time there or should we venture up to sodwana?  Should we bring our own mask and fins - trying to pack light?  I thought going to Durban would be good to experience a city but there doesnt seem to be good write ups about Durban  We like hiking but again I have read its not great there during winter. Should we visit?  Anything we are obviously near and missing out  Anything we should be considering/know  Many thanks. I last visited South Africa many years ago and worked in Zimbabwe so am excited to share the beauty and wonder of Africa with my three kids all these years later ,845philippap,,"Charleston, South..."
Our plan is to visit the park for 4 nights from May 29-June 2nd. Main interest is to see wildlife but also enjoy a diff scenery. Having done safaris in masai Mara sabi sands Etosha  Moremi and chobe in Botswana we decided to to visit the kalahari region  We will fly in & out of Jnb  Arrive 29th morning. Can do a self drive to park entrance. Did a self drive in Etosha last month. Will not risk roads that require skilled 4*4 driving like Moremi in Botswana  Hence my questions are which are the 2 areas we should be looking for lodges.  Also transfer between lodges if we cannot do a self drive.  Thanks ,Indranu H,,"Bangkok, Thailand"

HI  can you help ???  We are tourists from the UK and we will in the Kruger for ten days at the beginning of August. We are stopping in Polokwane on the way to stock up on supplies and then travelling to enter the Kruger in the north. Our first rest camp is the Punda Maria rest camp. There seems to be three ways to get there from Polokwane. On the 1 to Louis Trichardt and then left onto the R524  or the R81 all the way. But I have read a nicer journey is to take the 1 right up to the Nzhelele Reserve and then take the R525 to the Pafuri gate before travelling an hour to the Punda Maria Rest camp....your advice is appreciate ,robert092,Kruger National Park,UK
Hi    I’d like to buy an esim for my South Africa trip. Looked up MTN but seem to only find dead ends on their website.

We are landing in Jo’burg on Friday morning. We are staying in a hotel in Houghton before flying on to Victoria Falls the next day. We chose the hotel as we planned just to relax in the sunshine in the gardens. The weather looks like it is going to take a bit of a dip so I am after suggestions for an easy excursion/visit preferably not too far from the hotel and which will interest a 12 year old boy! I should say we are already planning on visiting the Apartheid museum a little later on our trip when we come back through the city. So just after something that will stop son getting bored and switching back to Nintendo mode…. Thanks ! ,anglaisefrancaise,,"Paris, France"
We are a family of 6. Considering self drive from Klaserie reserve to our next camp near Numbi gate via the Panorama route vs a private transfer. We have heard of incidences near the Numbi gate and are quite concerned about this. As we are moving from lodge to lodge our luggages would also be stored in the rental car in our way there. As far as I understand our 8 seater rented van does not have a covered trunk. Would appreciate any advice or opinions thank you. ,aliciaclaire2017,Mpumalanga,"Singapore, Singapore"
We are going to lower sabie rest camp and want to do a sunset drive by sanparks in a few days. If I google I read they last 3 hours. But exact times and can’t find.  Looks like from 4.30pm until 7.30pm. Am I right?    Kind regards  Ad van Loon ,adpatatje,Kruger National Park,"Oss, The Netherlands"
We have 3 days/ 2 nights to stay in the Addo area to visit game parks. Given availability and price I will spend one night at Hlosi lodge in Amakhala game reserve. Option 1 is to stay a second night there. Option 2 is to spend night 2 near Addo and visit Scotia (guided) in the afternoon of day 2 and Addo (self drive) in the morning of day 3. It's easiers to stay in one place but my question is whether the game drive experience is sufficiently different to make this a better option? Thanks in advance. ,WimpyAus,Port Elizabeth,"Sydney, Australia"
I’m looking into visiting the Apartheid museum (Johannesburg) before our flight home. We will be coming from the Midlands. Our flight doesn’t go until 23.00 but I would like to be at the airport before dark (17.30/18.00). This probably means rush hour? How long will it take to drive from the museum to the airport? And which route would be best to take? ,Anna,,

Hi I will be arriving at 0330. Thinking it best to stay at City Lodge or Intercontinental. Next flight isn’t until the next day. I know how to get to both hotels but I am not sure from a safety perspective which is best. City Lodge will be a longer walk through the tunnel. Intercontinental while short requires going outside and across the road. I don’t expect many people will be around as most shops will be closed and only one other flight arriving at that time.    Any ideas on safest way to proceed?    Thanks ,Lrob,Johannesburg,Maryland

My son and we’re thinking of doing these two trips together. We are around Mouille Point and will need an Uber. Are there other places to view penguins. Is Good Hope Point worth the drive.

I need to book a flight on Airlink from Kasane Botswana to Cape Town and have the choice of a 2hr 5min or 4hr 40min layover in Johannesburg. I'd prefer the shorter one as even with that we don't arrive in Cape Town until after 11pm.    Is 2 hrs enough??? Both flights are with Airlink so I assume no terminal change and we will be hopefully doing carry-on only.    TIA ,Betty L,,"Cozumel, Mexico"

Hi we're heading to South Africa (and Mozambique) for our honeymoon in November! I've been researching for a while and we're just about ready to do some initial bookings (flights/safari) this weekend. Aaaah. I initially wanted to use a travel agent to so we would have the extra protection and help if anything were to go wrong but the quotes are coming out at £3/4k more than doing it independently so here we go!    Any advice/tips for Garden Route self drive? Areas/roads to avoid? Should we bring our own satnav or hire one? Is it easy to get a SIM with data? What network would be best? I've been told not to drive in the dark/at night what time does it get dark in November? Is it easy enough to get taxis if we're going out for dinner/drinks or is it more of a stay in the hotel/guesthouse vibe? Out in the winelands how do people get around to visit vineyards (apart from winetram) does one person just not drink or are taxis easy here? (I swear we're not alcoholics)    Anything else we've not thought of? Are there any guides/blogs that list places to stop for food/pictures etc along the garden route?    Itinerary at the minute (including some possible accomodations) is looking like this    Cape town - 3 nights - camps bay/waterfront area - want to see table mountain/robben island/penguin beach    Collect hire care and head to Franschoek - 2 nights - winewinewine - looking at staying somewhere like Gable Manor or The Belmont. Current itinerary has this Tues-Thurs are things generally open all week?    Swellendam or Hermanus - 1 night - I know we're too late for whales but feel like maybe Hermanus has more to see/do for overnight and can get some nice sea views/recover from all the wine?    Oudtshoorn - 2 nights - Thinking if we stay in Hermanus we can drive here via Swellendam and stop in Mossel bay for lunch? We want to see Cango Caves and then maybe do some small walks or something? Don't know whether to cut this to 1 night and add in elsewhere? Like the look of Altes Landhaus and we could probably walk to Karusa wines one afternoon?    Knysna - 1 night - thinking spend the day around George/Wilderness and overnight in Knysna I've heard the gin distillery here is nice.    Plettenberg bay - 2 nights - Like the look of Emily Moon or Fairview House for somewhere a bit more fancy to stay.    From here we'd head to Port Elizabeth to fly up to Kruger we're looking at an 8am flight and Plettenburg is 2/3 hours from the airport would we be OK/safe leaving Plett around 4am to drive to the airport or should we add a night in Port Elizabeth? I've been told not to drive at night/in the dark.    Safari - 3 nights - we've pretty much narrowed it down to either RockFig or Senalala lodge (there's so much choice it's insane)    Beach in Vilanculos (Mozambique) - 5 nights - hoping to stay at asDunas - this isn't really the right place for this. (we have an overnight in Johannesburg on the way from Kruger to Vilanculos but thinking we'll just stay near the airport)    Johannesburg - 2 nights - we have to come back this way to fly home so thinking do 2 nights and we can do tours to apartheid museum Soweto and Cradle of Humankind. Not really sure where to stay here.    Any suggestions/tips greatly appreciated :) thanks xx ,Sarah R,,Manchester
Hi everyone. 5 weeks to go until our trip and I have downloaded 2 apps to help me track load shedding but I'm having real issues understanding them and whether they are accurate of what's actually going on at the moment.    I have the ESP app and have been able to add the areas we are going to so it says today at V&A Waterfront the next scheduled load shedding is tomorrow 1-3:30pm but it also says at the top of the app Cape Town is in stage 1 scheduled until 23:00. Are the timings her accurate?    I've also got the Load Shedding Notifier app and adding regions to that is really complicated and it says tomorrow 2-4:30pm in CT Waterfront so slightly different times.    I know it's all subject to change any any time but plan to plan things around the shedding so would like a bit of accuracy. Do hotels share this type of info while there too? ,lc2blt,,"Leeds, United..."

Hi    My international flight will arrive Johannesburg around 6.30am. I see from Airlink they have flights out to Skukuza at 10am and another at 1pm.    I'm wondering if I should book the 10am flight? How long do you reckon I need to clear customs collect baggage and recheck in at the domestic terminal?    Also from Airlink it states that only 1 hand luggage is permitted. In Europe terms it means only 1 luggage including backpack/handbag. However in Asia terms most airlines allow 1 hand luggage plus one small bag (backpack handbag etc). Anyone know if Airlink allows 1 luggage with 1 backpack for hand carry?

Hello everyone    My interest in Tswalu began from a discussion with our safari operator and continued from discussions with guides who had been to the camp. The reason I've been interested is there are three animals I've never seen/photographed that are at the very top of my list.  - Pangolin  - Aardvark  - Meerkat    I've been told that this is the best place in the world for all three.    We've previously been on four safaris and have been to the Manyeleti Timbavati Sabi Sands Etosha in Namibia Hwange and Mana Pools in Namibia Mashatu in Botswana and the Serengeti Ngorongoro and Tarangire in Tanzania. We've had very good sightings outside of these three animals.    Another reason I'm intrigued with Tswalu is cheetahs which are my favorite African mammal. As I understand they are commonly sighted at the reserve.    We're planning to take another safari next year and Tswalu would have been a major part of it except for an incident involving their booking personnel. I won't go into the details but when we were looking to book them for our previous safari their booking person was very rude and we ended up removing them from the itinerary.    Therefore Tswalu is now on my wife's hate list and she has zero desire to visit it after our initial experience.    For next year I'd like to go all out for a major birthday milestone but so far the itineraries our operator has given us just don't work. I follow Tswalu on IG on they seem to be exactly what I'm looking for and our operator has said that there's really no way to substitute it.    However to convince my wife to include them will be extremely difficult and I fear it will be very painful for me if we arrive at the resort and find it lacking.    Before I undertake this endeavour I'd therefore like to understand whether there are any other resorts that can offer this complement of animals and service (I also like that you have a private vehicle and they can send trackers ahead) and if the actual resort's reputation is justified.    Thank you for your help! ,kirispupis,Northern Cape,Seattle

Hello everyone    Firstly thank you for posting in this forum. I’m already learning a lot and I will keep reading and learning.    1. Due to commitments me and my husband (late 50s) take our main holiday in January. I know this is not the best time to visit KNP but is early or late January best?    2. It will be a two week trip split between KNP and Cape Town. We will fly into Johannesburg and out of Cape Town (or the other way round depending on itinerary). How does 4 or 5 nights sound at KNP and 9 or 10 nights in Cape Town?    2. My preference is to fly from Manchester but flights are indirect. Flying direct from London is an option after travelling from Liverpool though. Swings and roundabouts. Any thoughts?    3. I plan to stay southern KNP but I don’t want to stay in basic camp accommodation. I want comfort and luxury but without getting too carried away with the budget. So far Bucklers Africa Lodge Komatipoort and Mbizi Bush Lodge Phalaborwa have caught my eye. They both seem to offer good accommodation at around £100 pppn. Mbizi also includes breakfast and dinner in that rate. Any similar recommendations?    5. Both accommodations organise escorted drives. Is this better than booking escorted drives direct with SANparks? We will hopefully do some self driving too.    6. Is there much to be gained using a travel agent compared to diy booking? Is there a great price difference?    Thank you for your help. ,broccolisnapper57,,"Rainhill, United..."

My husband overstayed 3 days in December 2022 and received a 12 month ban which we appealed within the 10 day period. We waited 6 months for any kind of response and only when I asked the High Commission in Windhoek and they forwarded my request at almost 7 months did I get a response. I was asked to provide further documentation and then informed that I would be notified of the decision per email. In anticipation we booked a trip from Windhoek to Mauritius with no option but to TRANSIT at OR Tambo. We have not received any further communication and all emails are ignored phones unanswered (Including Home Affairs Contact Centre and OR Tambo immigration.)  Does anyone have any verifiable information or has anyone successfully transited with a pending overstay appeal ban? Any help would be appreciated. ,Keren T,,"Swakopmund, Namibia"

Hi there    Have done some research and the tuk tuks seem like a far better idea than the wine tram (though if anyone thinks otherwise please shout!)

Hi we are a group of three women and will be using Crocodile Bridge as entry and exit gates to KNP in early 2024. We are trying to decide between staying in either Marloth Park or Komatipoort. We don't mind that Marloth Park is slightly further from CBG since it seems beautiful and has many accommodation choices but we are slightly concerned with some comments on its safety in the past. Komatipoort is definitely convenient but is it as pretty as Marloth Park and again is it safe? This will be our first visit to KNP. We'd like to be as careful as possible in our planning so that we can minimize the probability of unpleasant mishaps. Thank you ,JhengdaMom,Kruger National Park,Taipei
We are planning our Sout africa trip for the Christmas Holidays. We have read quite a but still have some doubts and looking for advice.    We are considering the itenary below and plan to use rental car for complete trip.  Doubts:  - Not enough quality time in Krugerpark (only 2.5 days). We could add a night in Satara on day 4 and give up 1 day of Capetown. We could then also drive to eSwatini a bit earlier by skipping morning drive (e.g. stay at crocodile bridge).  - Are our few nights in eSwatini/St. Lucia making sense or is too rushed? (skipping eSwatini would result in a very long drive). The border crossing also reduxd the car rental options and increases price.  - Is rental car in Capetown a must? We don't mind taking public transport as long as it is not limiting too much and taking more time    1. 11am Arrival in Johannesburg airport pickup car & drive to Lydenburg  2. Drive to nThambo (Klaserie) lunch afternoon game drive  3. Morning game drive & bush walk drive to Panprama route area view 1/2 sights night somewhere along route  4. View remaining of panorama route night at hazyview  5. Kruger park self drive: Phanebi -> Lower Sabie (+afternoon organized game drive)  6.

Hello!    I am planning a trip to SA in 2024. I will be starting in Cape Town for 4 days and then move on to Hazyview for one day and then 6 days on safari around the Kruger and Sabi Sands area. Right now I am looking at August because I have heard that is the best month for game drives.    But I have also been told that is one of the worst months for weather in Cape Town. We are planning quite a few outdoor activities in Cape Town like hikes and visiting the penguins. Would you guys stick with an August itinerary or is there a sweet spot month where weather patterns tend to be better suited for safari AND Cape Town?    Thanks so much! ,Katie,,"Omaha, Nebraska"
Hi all I am hoping for some advice what your preferred route would be for driving from Satara to Parsons Hilltop Safari Camp next September. Google Maps gives me two options:    1. leave Satara northbound exit KNP at Phalaborwa and then a short drive via R71 and R40 south.  2. Go from Satara to Orpen Acornhoek and R40 north    What would your preference be considering game viewing in KNP and road quality/safety outside KNP? ,erikkie39,Kruger National Park,"The Hague, The..."
We are going to South Africa in January with a tour group. We will arrive in South Africa and will eventually go to eSwatiniwith them. We realize that we will need two pages free for a stamp in our passports to enter South Africa but will we still need them two more pages for entrance for one night in eSwatini? Our passports don't expire until August 2025 but we are concerned about the number of pages we might need for this trip. ,karoleigh,,North Carolina

Hello everyone! I am heading to South Africa with my husband for 3 weeks. I have included my itinerary below and would love recommendations on fun stop and restaurants along the way. We are intentionally spending a lot of time on game drives as my husband loves photography and we are both pretty crazy about safaris.    I would love recommendations on any eateries markets attractions or fun stops along the way!  I am particularly stumped on how to spend my last days in Cape Town. I wasn't planning to go to Robben Island or the vineyards (mostly because I grew up very close to wine country and so many of my previous trips have involved vineyards but if you think this is a misstep please let me know).    Any recommendations on hotels AirBnB's or neighborhoods to stay in while in Cape Town? I particularly like walkable beachy places but also anywhere I can see animals from my porch. 🙂    10/17: Johannesburg for 1 full day. JHB Zoo or head to Bird Island to see the gannets. Any food recommendations close to the zoo or airport? I am super bummed that the Apartheid Museum won't be open during our short stay.  10/18-10/23 Fly out to Hoedspruit. Stay at Elephant Plains Lodge in Sabi Sands for our wedding anniversary.  10/23-10/27 Self drive in Kruger National Park ending in Nelspruit and fly to Port Elizabeth  10/27-10/29 Kragga Kamma Game Reserve in Port Elizabeth. Start the garden route drive. Must eats in Port Elizabeth?  10/29-10/31 The Craggs Plettenberg Bay and Knysna (oysters!) We will be visiting Monkeyland Birds of Eden Lawnwood Snakes and Jukani Park. We will be staying at Tenikwa Nature Lodge.  Would love recommendations for yummy eateries and stop along this leg of trip!  10/31-11/1: Whale watching in Gansbaai and Hermanus walk along Cliff Path head to Betty's Bay and Stony Point Penguin Colony  11/2-11/3: Head to Simon's Town where our rental is located with stops along Muizenberg Kalk Bay for lunch Dalebrook Tidepool and Fish Hoek.  Drive to Cape Point National Park  Any food recommendations for these towns?  11/4 Cape Town  Drive through Chapman's Peak from SImon's Town and stop at Hout Bay for breakfast at the market.  Hang out at Camp's Bay and Clifton for beach time  Lunch at Old Biscuit Mill  Sunset at Lion Head  Dinner at Black Sheep...? or VA Cape Town Fishmarket?  11/5 Table Mountain Cable for sunrise  Kirstenbosch Gardens??  V & A Aquarium??  11/6 Cape Town - last day flight departs at 10:55pm.  Plans are open...  Thank you for your input and recommendation. I really appreciate any help I can get! 🙂 ,Jenny C,,Los Angeles...

We are a couple staying in kruger 5 nights on september 2023 first timers and traveling from overseas. Besides the usual animals we are interested in birds.  1st night we will be staying close to Melalane; next 2 nights will be at Berg-en-Dal and last 2 nights at Satara.    - 1st Day: day i was thinking to get early into the park and do a loop: Melalane Croc bridge Lower Sabie Berg-en-Dal. Is this doable? if so which would be the route to take?    - 2nd day: Are sunset/sunrise drives at Berg-En-Dal worth? our alternative is keep driving on the same loop i mentioned above.    - 3rd day: Drive north to Satara check in and we have a sunset drive reserved. Would we have time to go on the S100?    - 4th day: Drive to Olifants area and back. Or would you recommend another route? we have a night drive reserved at the camp.    -5th day: Drive from Satara to Hoedspruit airport via Orpen. Our flight is at noon and we would need to return our car at what time should we plan to arrive to HDS?    Thanks for your recommendations. ,santamariaFrontdesk,Kruger National Park,"Alajuela, Costa Rica"

Hello all    I have seen some photos of shore based whale watching in Hermanus which show the whales incredibly close to the shore.    I was wondering how common this is ?    In an average season do they come close daily? weekly? or is it rare and you would need to be particularly lucky?    The photos I have seen appear to show the whales within 10m of the shore.  If I go it would be around late August early September.    Cheers! ,East_London99,,

Are Ubers safe to use around Cape Town day and night?? ,Jenny Y,Cape Town Central,
My family and I are going to Cape Town for the first time in May 2024. It will be my daughters 9 and 8 my wife and I. I am looking to spend 5 nights before heading to Madikwe for a 5 night safari. Looking to stay near the waterfront and probably Table Bay Hotel. My question is I have made a list of things that I was thinking of doing but am not sure if I will be biting off too much. I plan of getting the city pass for 5 days and utilizing the HOHO bus for most transportation. We will probably be arriving late evening from the states the first day so I am not planning anything other then getting to the hotel eating then sleeping. Here are a list of things i was thinking of doing:    Day 1- world of birds seal island (Circe charters) Muriel's munchies scratch patch and Cave golf  Day 2- half day Boulder Beach Playdate Jolly Roger pirate ship  Day 3- kirstenbosch or Acrobranch Constantia seal island (Drumbeat charters) Cape wheel  Day 4- Table mountain Hard Rock Cafe two oceans aquarium    I want to utilize the city pass a lot and all the activities are free except for Boulder Beach. It seems like it is a lot to do but I realize that a lot of the activities are only an hour or so. Will I be wasting too much time on the bus going from place to place?    I do also realize that many of these things are weather dependent and may need to be flexible especially with Table mountain.    Any ideas or recommendations of what I can scratch off or to add would be appreciated. ,luv2travel2newplaces,Cape Town,"Lancaster, New York"
Hi    We will be hiring a car in our upcoming trip and will be travelling from Cape town central to Hermanus and then returning to the airport.

Hello    Beginning of October I will be travelling to South Africa for work. Staying in Johannesburg (North East Pomona) for a week.  My wife and kid (15 years old) will come over and stay 4 days in Johannesburg with me. Afterwards we would take a day or 5 to enjoy a holiday somewhere. This brings me to 2 questions:    - As I will be working the first 4 days my wife and kid are there what could they do in and around Johannesburg?    - What do you suggest doing for a 5 day holiday? I got the suggestion to go to Pilanesberg or take the plane to Cape town. ,Yavel,,"Leuven, Belgium"

After figuring out work tickets and visas I'm finally looking at a 10 nights solo (34 M Indian) birthday trip in SA! The catch? I'm landing in just two weeks and I haven't yet fixed my itinerary (or hotel bookings) :')    I was hoping to run my itinerary past the good folks here before sealing things for good so please let me know if I'm making some serious flaws.    21 May - Land at JNB at 8 AM Uber it to a hotel in Rosebank (Clico or Hyatt House). In the afternoon catch some local sightseeing (Apartheid Museum / Constitution Hill) and get a nice birthday dinner for myself somewhere (will look up recommendations).    22 May - Figure a township and/or inner city tour. Would also like to check out the arts districts in Maboneng.    23 May - Fly to Hoedspruit and transfer to a lodge (Nyati or Milima). PM game drive.    24 May - AM & PM game drives    25 May - Day tour to Panorama Route    26 May - Fly from Hoedspruit to Cape Town transfer to Franschhoek (Franschhoek Boutique Hotel or Basse Provence Guest House at Rickety Bridge)    27 May - Day in Franschhoek - wine tasting and some nice food.    28 May - Transfer back to Cape Town in the morning (AC Marriott or Taj trying to see if I can afford something at the V&A). Perhaps do a Robben Island trip?    29 May - Table Mountain first thing in the morning. Later a walk around Bo Kaap and Company Gardens. In the PM head to Clifton / Camp's Bay.    30 May - Using this day for Kirstenbosch Muizenberg Boulders and Cape.    31 May - Sunrise from the waterfront maybe (Blouberg Beach perhaps? Or is that better done in the PM?). After breakfast will pack up and leave for the airport. My flight from CPT departs at 12.55 PM.    Feel free to weigh in but do keep in mind that:  - I'm travelling solo and while it's nice to slow down and explore a place nicely I can also find it becoming a little bit boring after a point.  - My core interests while travelling are being able to take pretty photographs - usually landscapes and architecture.  - While I'm happy paying a premium on my safety and comfort I don't have unlimited amounts of money either - I'm looking at averaging out at around 200-250 USD per day all inclusive.    Big questions -    - Is two nights in Johannesburg an overkill? I definitely want to stay there on my first night in SA to buffer any incoming flight delays. I figured doing two nights will let me at least see the place half-properly.    - In the same vein is two nights at Franschhoek worth it as well? Or should I just do a day tour from Cape Town instead (maybe through the wine tram)? I did find Franschhoek's countryside to be exceedingly pretty and I could see myself spending a little extra time there to take some landscape photographs.    - On Kruger I'm leaning towards Nyati / Milima simply because they are all-inclusive in my budget are still available and have a private reserve where I have a decent chance of spotting some big game (I'm keen on lions hippos giraffes and zebras - have enough and more elephants and leopards back home). Also it keeps me within long day tripping distance of the Panorama Route (to be fair the only bits here I'm actually keen on seeing are the Blyde River Canyon and the Three Rondavels). Am I missing out on some essential logic though?    I do hope I can get some solid replies - looking to book hotels and internal flights over the weekend.

We recently completed a 9-night trip to Southern Africa with 2 nights in Victoria Falls 4 nights on safari at two camps in the Okavango Delta and 2 nights in Cape Town. It was an amazing trip with the highlight being the extraordinary up-close-and-personal game viewing in the Delta.    Below are some trip notes on the Cape Town portion of our trip. These are trip notes with practical information for those planning a trip to Southern Africa rather than a diary-style trip report. Our trip notes for Vic Falls and the Okavango Delta have been separately posted on the appropriate forums.    OUR BASIC ITINERARY    Day 0: Evening arrival in JNB; overnight in Johannesburg    Day 1: Morning flight from Johannesburg to Livingstone Zambia; afternoon visit to Zambia side of Vic Falls; overnight in Livingstone    Day 2: morning Walk With Lions; afternoon visit to Zimbabwe side of Vic Falls; overnight in Livingstone    Day 3: early morning Livingstone Island & Angel’s Pool; transfer from Livingstone to Kasane Botswana; bush flight from Kasane to Okavango Delta (Splash Camp); afternoon and overnight at Splash Camp    Day 4: full day and overnight at Splash Camp    Day 5: full day and overnight at Splash Camp    Day 6: morning at Splash Camp; mid-day bush flight from Splash Camp to Pom Pom Camp; afternoon and overnight at Pom Pom Camp    Day 7: morning at Pom Pom Camp; late morning bush flight from Pom Pom Camp to Maun Botswana; afternoon flight from Maun to Cape Town; overnight in Cape Town    Day 8: full day sightseeing in Cape Town; overnight in Cape Town    Day 9: guided drive along Cape Peninsula; evening flight from CPT    1. CAPE TOWN    We had two full days in Cape Town and the best use of our time seemed to be to do one full day on our own sightseeing in the city and one full day with a guide/driver visiting the sites around the Cape Peninsula.    This was early June (South African winter) and much of what we planned to do was centered on the outdoors and was going to be highly dependent on the weather. We decided to do the first day in the city and the second day on the Peninsula so that we could proceed directly to the airport after the drive. We had very little flexibility to adjust our plans based on the weather so we just hoped for the best.    * City Sightseeing Day *    For our day of city sightseeing we started with Table Mountain proceeded to the Bo Kapp neighborhood (Malay Quarter) then walked around the central area of the city (Company’s Gardens Garden Synagogue various nice buildings and statues around the area) visited the Castle of Good Hope and ended the day walking around the pier and V&A Waterfront.    Table Mountain was the definite highlight of the day. We really lucked out with the weather and had beautiful clear views the entire time. In the interest of time we took the cable car both ways. If we had more time it would have been really nice to hike up and then take the cable car down. The entire Table Mountain operation is really organized well maintained and professional. The cable car rotates 360 degrees around as the car moves up/down which means that everyone can just stand in his/her place and still get to experience all of the views. At the top there’s a really nice and well-signed path that basically circles around the entire mountaintop. We spent a good hour-plus taking our time walking around and taking photos of all the different views. It is very cold and windy at the top.    We didn’t find any of the other sites/stops to be absolute must-dos or highlights. In other words putting aside Table Mountain it’s a city that is lacking true star attractions.    That being said we had a very enjoyable day doing essentially an improvised walking tour of the various highlights of the city. The various sites/stops are collectively interesting and it was nice to walk around and explore some of the various areas of the city.    The city is rather sketchy in places but in broad daylight with street smarts we felt safe enough.    * Cape Peninsula Day Trip w/ Amazing Guide Charlie Ratcliffe *    The Cape Peninsula is beautiful and a day trip driving around the Peninsula is a must-do. Highlights were the many impressive views of mountains and beaches along the drive seeing the cute penguin colony up close at Boulders Beach walking up to the lighthouse at Cape Point taking a cheesy photo with the sign at the Cape of Good Hope and detouring around the Cape Point Nature Reserve to see zebras and eland antelopes.    While it’s always great to see beautiful scenery the Cape Peninsula does not look so different from the California coast. For us it wasn’t stunning outer-world scenery that we’d never seen before but it was still a gorgeous drive.    We hired Charlie Ratcliffe as our guide/driver for the day trip. We had a wonderful day viewing the beautiful sites on the Peninsula drive and chatting with Charlie about South African history life politics etc. He is outstanding and we would unconditionally recommend him for everything and anything in or around Cape Town.    It would have been easy enough to do this day trip as a self-drive but with our limited time it would have been a big hassle to rent and drop off a car just for a one-day trip. So we got quotes from various chauffeur companies and as well as from Charlie who had great recommendations on the internet. Charlie wasn’t cheap and was well more expensive than getting a random driver from a chauffeur company but we were very impressed with his reviews and our communications with him and decided to splurge on what appeared to be a very good guide.    Charlie is the consummate professional. He was able to highly customize the day both to fit our specific interests and to help us “navigate” around the weather. There are a lot of pre-fabbed generic Peninsula tours but we told Charlie in advance what interested and didn’t interest us. Charlie was really able to help us prioritize the various stops so we could spend more time at the places we liked while quickly seeing the places that didn’t interest us as much. We also told him we wanted to avoid the tour buses and he gladly picked us up at 8am to get us out ahead of the crowds.    Best of all when we met up with Charlie in the morning he told us that bad weather would be coming in at around 3pm and he rearranged the plans to make sure we got in the most critical outdoor/viewpoint activities before then. Sure enough bad weather hit at 3pm and there was almost no visibility. We were very lucky to have Charlie’s ability to add value by thinking on his feet and considering our interests and the weather in order to maximize our day. This day would have been much worse with an ordinary driver who was robotically following a set program.    Charlie’s email address is trout@universe.co.za . In addition to guiding in Cape Town Charlie leads safaris all around Southern Africa so he might not have so much availability. But if he’s not booked definitely book him.    * Cape Town Hotel*    We stayed at the Portswood Hotel which is adjacent to the V&A Waterfront. We wanted to be on or near the Waterfront because that seemed to be the safest area and the Portswood Hotel seemed to be the most affordable hotel that got decent reviews. It was a very nice hotel and we are happy we stayed there.    * Getting Around Cape Town *    We used Uber to get from the airport to the hotel and to get around the city. Uber was very cheap safe and convenient. Rides within the city were often around $2-3. The airport transfer was about $7 and there’s a safe clearly designated Uber pickup area outside the terminal. We found that drivers would usually appear within 2-3 minutes and they were all very nice safe and professional.    * Flying in South Africa *    We took two flights on Airlink (Joberg-Livingstone & Maun-Cape Town). Airline is a former subsidiary of South African Airways and was perfectly functional.    * Money *    Credit cards are widely accepted in Cape Town including at all the major tourist sites. And we used Uber for all our transport. We barely had to use cash.    * Overnight Layover in Johannesburg*    We had an overnight layover in Johannesburg upon our arrival in South Africa. We didn’t have time to see anything in Johannesburg and had no real desire to. There didn’t seem to be any tourist attractions of note and what we knew about city’s crime situation made venturing out into the city even more unappealing.    We stayed at the Marriott Protea near the airport which was a perfectly nice and clean hotel. The downside is the inconvenient airport shuttle.    The hotel has a free airport shuttle but it only runs every 30 mins. It’s only a 5-minute drive so there’s no reason the shuttle can’t run every 15-20 minutes. On arrival we just missed the shuttle so we figured we’d just take an Uber. Our SIM cards weren’t yet picking up the network and the airport WiFi is stupidly designed in that you need to check your email to register in order to use it. So we couldn’t order an Uber. We didn’t want to take a risk with a random taxi so we just waited for the next shuttle.    *Final Thoughts*    Overall we had a very enjoyable two days in Cape Town. One day of city sites and one day driving around the Peninsula turned out to be a very good combination. Plus our wonderful guide Charlie Ratcliffe really enhanced our experience on the Peninsula. Cape Town is a beautiful city / region in terms of the natural setting but outside of the Waterfront we felt that it was a pretty icky city in terms of the streets buildings people etc.    We’re definitely glad we visited Cape Town as part of our Southern Africa trip. However we didn’t find it to be the type of city that on its own would be worth flying halfway around the world to visit. It’s also not a city that we fell in love with and would want to ever live in. Also as mentioned the region looks quite a bit like California so while we appreciate beautiful scenery it didn’t feel particularly exotic to us.    Cape Town is the kind of city we’re truly fortunate to have seen once but wouldn’t rush back to. In other words spending a few days in Cape Town is a definite must-do for anyone on a Southern Africa safari. ,LAX_Esq,Cape Town,Los Angeles...

We have a few days in Cape Town in early October after 2 weeks in Uganda and 10 days in Kenya. I keep thinking I need to see more animals. I was considering driving to Bontenbok- firstly is there someone who can give us half a day’s guiding - and secondly is there somewhere similarly close to Cape Town but better for wildlife? Once again a guide if possible?  Thank you ,Mandy G,Cape Town,Sydney

We will be visiting Johannesburg in September prior to our journey to Madagascar and during my research I came across a city tour option utilizing Tuk-Tuks. My query pertains to the safety aspect of opting for this mode of transportation for the city tour. I would greatly appreciate your insights on this matter.  Furthermore I would like to inquire about the pricing details for a 3-day Kruger safari where we would prefer midrange accommodation options. ,Cicano c,,Springfield...

Hi All    Looking to spend 10 full days in Africa (12 if you include the day coming in and the day going out). Right now we are flying into Jo'burg on the 1st of April and looking to do about 3-4 days in Kruger (we love animals so we want to do a little bit of that). We then want to fly to Cape town and do part of the garden route before spending some time in South Africa. Obviously 10 days isn't enough - I wish we had longer but it's tough to get everyone together. I will then need to come back to Jo'burg at the end to spend a night before flying out - the rest of the group will fly out of cape town.    My question around this is :  - How do we plan where we get to Kruger - is it better to fly or drive. We are a family of 7 no one younger than 21 so it's not a young young family (meaning flights could turn out to be expensive as well).  - Where's the best area to stay in Kruger to get 3 days out of Safari's (seeing the big 5 etc)? In terms of budgets our budget is mid range - something nice but not luxury.  - Is it better to take a guide from Jo'burg or from Kruger?  - Is there any recommendation of the split between Kruger Cape Town & the garden route? A note that majority of the group aren't wine drinkers so wineries aren't on the top of the list.    Advice appreciated thank you! ,Jay,,"Melbourne, Australia"

Hello    My son has been volunteering through Wildlife Act for 10 weeks. I am flying out to meet him and spend almost 2 weeks in Cape Town in mid-July 2023. Our home base will be Mouille Point during our stay. We are huge nature fans and want to hike fly fish and explore. We are not big crowd people but would flex for the right activity. I am looking for activity hiking and dining suggestions. We are unsure about renting a car and would like a recco on if uber would be the best bet. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. ,KMucho,,
So my friend came from South Africa several months ago and I bought all his Rands. Now that I've been here for a while I don't need them all because I always used my card. Any recommendations on where to sell Rands? Places that have zero or low commissions?  I am American and I want US dollars. And yes I know that I can go to the foreign exchange office is at the airport but they're charging between three and 4%..    Should I maybe go to a local bank here in Kyalami or maybe to Sandton or some other places or should I just bite the bullet and sell them at the airport?    I'm going to Jordan Egypt and Morocco for the next three weeks before I head to the UK.... ,John Dee,,"Houston, Texas"

My sister and I are planning a self-drive trip to Kruger in 2024 planning to stay in the park for 10-12 days. We'll fly into MQP airport and pickup/return our rental car there. Having read about some travel safety concerns around Numbi and other nearby gates we are thinking of using Phalaborwa and Crocodile gates as entry/exit points to KNP (entering from one exiting from the other). We are also thinking of spending a couple of days in Graskop to enjoy sights on the Panorama route enroute to (or after exiting) Phalaborwa gate.    We would really appreciate any advice about travel safety and anything else that we need to watch out for. Thank you! ,Mutter1,Kruger National Park,"Taipei, Taiwan"

Hi there!    I am flying to South Africa from Belgium during the first week of January and fly back on the 12th of June. The purpose of my travel is an internship. My university college gave me the paperwork to arrange my visa far too late. The risk now exists that I won't get my passport with the visa back in time for my flight to Cape Town. Due to this I consider going to South Africa and stay on a tourist visa for 90 days leave South Africa to stay in Namibia for some time and go back to South Africa until June.    My question is as follows: How long do I need to stay in Namibia if I want to re enter South Africa again on another 90 days tourist visa?    Thank you for your replies.

Hello we are planning for an 8 day trip for our family of 4 to KNP on the 19th of July (rather last minute I know).  We are flying to JHB and we will be renting a car to drive to KNP.  Last time we visited SA was almost 20 years ago on our honeymoon driving trough SA and staying at Hazyview for visiting KNP.  Now I have read that there have been some safety issues on the west side of KNP ( Numbi Gate and some say broader region) so we were thinking of driving either to Malalane or Komatipoort for the first few days of our visit and do day trips into the park from there.  Is any of these two options safer/nicer/better restaurants etc. than the other ?  After that we would drive up north through the park and maybe exit at the Orpen Gate to stay at Hoedspruit and visit the central/northern regio of the park from there.  Would that be a good/safe option ?    Any suggestions are welcome ! ,Steven B,Kruger National Park,

Hi Folks    Continuing plans for our 2024 trip. We've now decided to drive to and from KNP. We have 3 days at Oliphants and 3 days at Mopani. On our final day in the park we want to make the most of it so we are thinking of driving south and exiting around Skukuza. Now looking for a suitable place to stop over other than Hazyview (we want to get further towards JNB) or Graskop (ditto and we are staying there for 2 nights on the outbound trip).    Can anyone suggest an overnight stop-over outside the park on the way back to JNB please; and which gate we should exit. We did exit at Numbi gate in 2014 and followed Google Maps. Don't particularly want to do that again.    We'll leave at daybreak so can probably cover quite a distance before dusk even allowing for some viewing and breakfast on the way.    Many TIA    Edit: Not Mbombela either. ,GALESA2,,"Bega, Australia"

Hi    Interested in people’s opinions on where to spend the first 2 nights of our garden route itinerary - looking for somewhere to rest our heads between Franschoek and Wilderness - I know that these towns are not in any way in the middle of our drive but the scenery has really caught my eye.    I used to live somewhere with whales galore and so not too fussed about hitting any whale watching from Hermanus…. We love hiking  photography  relaxing somewhere beautiful -    Found an amazing looking Airbnb on the beach in Rooi Els but thinking it may be a little TOO quiet for us - in an ideal world we want to be close ish for somewhere to get a bite to eat in the evening (even better if in walking distance) - so was thinking Pringle Bay perhaps a better option? We would then be going onto a relatively remote b&b in wilderness where we’ll be cooking for ourself hence wanting to be close to food options for this bit of the stay….    Thanks !

Hey guys.  My girlfriend and I need to put together a 15-day itinerary we have an idea for example:    Johannesburg 3 days  Safari 3 or 4 days? (which Safaris and which Lodges all inclusive?)  Cape Town 3 days  Garden Route (3 days?)  Wineries (2 days?)  Then it would probably be back to Johannesburg to catch the flight back.    I would like to know if there are too few or too many days in any of the places.  If there were more cool places for us to see regarding safaris it would be the place we intend to invest to stay in a nice place and see a greater diversity of animals.    We're open to cool experiences that we didn't include in this initial roadmap.    That would be it for now. I already thank those who contribute with me. ,Alexandre S,,

Be warned and beware about going for The Travel Intern (TTI) experience trips    Recently I went for a The Travel Intern (TTI) experience trip to South Africa. It was a most disappointing experience. The tour was overpriced and there was little to no value add from the TTI team. Several deliverables (such as pre-trip photography workshop and special video) were also not fulfilled.    TTI is basically a middleman that outsource their tours to the local South African agency (TTI themselves have with little to no local knowledge but yet charges a significant markup). I paid around 3k SGD for the land tour that includes safari rafting horse riding and 3 nights hotel stay in Johannesburg.    safari tour package including transport  https://moafrikatours.com/6-day-kruger-treehouse-safari  ZAR 16095 = 1.1k SGD    3nights hotel at Johannesburg catalyst newmark hotel  100SGD per night *3 = 300SGD (being generous... booking.com agoda and other websites shows an average rate of SGD60 to SGD70)    rafting  https://liquidadventures.activitar.com/  ZAR 495 = 33 SGD    horse riding  https://lionandsafaripark.activitar.com/services/12885  ZAR 450 = 31 SGD    The 3k SGD participants paid basically comprises of the above. If one were to book it directly it would have cost (1.1k+300+33+30=around 1.5k) - basically a markup of 1.5k or double their cost price.    And what do participants get in return? Participants were promised amongst other things like exclusive pre-trip photography workshop. This was undelivered till date!!    There also supposed to be a special video to commemorate the trip. This was also undelivered till date!!    The pre-trip information booklet was also poorly done. There were many references to Nepal in the South-Africa pre-trip information booklet. For example (see attached image): Under the Inclusions were items like ACAP Permit TIMS card sherpas porters whilst under the exclusion list items like nepal VISA (USD 30 on arrival) . Whoever did up the pre-trip info booklet must have copied and pasted from another trip. Disappointing!!    We were also advised that no malaria pills were needed pre-trip. But the information from CDC website indicates otherwise. The information from the local travel provider also indicates the need for anti-malaria pills.  https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/s.html    Also they are not receptive to feedback. My feedback sent several months ago have still not been responded to...    Finally around half the tour group members are somewhat related to the tour leader timothy heng - be it his friends colleagues and their family... So I guess this would give you some food for thought about the receptivity of the tour    TLDR: Overall this tour has been utmost disappointing. On reflection I should have booked direct instead. Paid an extra 1.5k SGD for things that I am still waiting for and undelivered till date! Not to mention the gibberish pre-trip guide that contains erroneous information about hiking in Nepal! Be warned and beware!! ,ML,,

We have a trip of a lifetime booked for this September but sadly because of serious family illness we need to move it to next year. The travel agent have offered to move it to anything up to next June and are suggesting April/May 2024. We had an itinerary that was 3 nights Kruger safari 4 nights Cape Town plus half the Garden route to include Whale watching in Hermanus (2 nights) which we understand is not possible in May.    We are very confused as to the best time to move it to next year or if we need to bite the bullet and lose our deposit and rebook for next September?

Hi all    We are a family of 6 (4 adults and 2 teenagers). We are staying at the Kruger Gate hotel for 4 nights; so we have 2 Full-days for game drives and we want to use them wisely.    between morning afternoon evening night walk drive self drive sanpark private we are a bit lost.    What we know for sure is:  we want to try at least once self-drive.  We want to spot as many species as possible; so we want to know what are the best times to book game drives to ensure diversity.  Can we do morning and evening only or we need afternoon and night?  Also can the private game-drives be at the park past gate closing hours or do we need to book the SANPARK for those?

Hi there    I am currently planning our two week Cape Town / Garden Route trip for next January / February (husband and I - mid to late thirties)…    At the moment I am planning ~8 nights along the cost starting around Hermanus and flying out of PE. I have booked us into Quatermains camp for our last two nights in Amakhala - but was wondering if it was worth taking a detour up to Oudtshoorn for a night in one of the clamping tents at Buffelsdrift ? I have got what seems to be a pretty good deal on one of their “horizon view tents” - around 4500 ZAR for a night including dinner - but not sure if it’s worth the extra driving ? We wouldn’t be overly interested in heading inland if it wasn’t for the stay in the lodge ….    I’m really excited about seeing the animals in their natural environment and it feels like maybe Buffelsdrift is more of an open air zoo with accommodation and a restaurant - or am I not being fair ?    All thoughts / opinions very much welcomed !    Thanks  Amy ,Amy T,Garden Route,"London, United..."

Im planning to heading to Kruger April till May 2024.  Plans are to fly from Johannesburg to Skukuza then hire a car.  Drive to Lower Sabie Rest Camp  4 nights  Drive to Olifants  4 nights  I have also booked 7 nights at a private game reserve north east of Olifants. I am now questioning if I should cancel this reservation  and maybe stay in another bush camp or 2 if so which ones?  Originally I was thinking of staying 4 nights at Crocodile Bridge then head north to Lower Sabie. After some research ive learnt both camps are very close to each other. I have also read there is alot of wildlife at Crocodile Bridge so should I now reconsider and stay at Crocodile Bridge Then Lower Sabie and move onto another camp between Lower Sabie and Olifants?    What I am after seeing is wild dogs and hippos as well as the other big 5.  I have 14 days to play with in Kruger.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ,Sally W,Kruger National Park,

Am I correct that if you cancel a Kruger reservation made online with Sanparks more than 30 days in advance there is no cancellation fee? It appears that full prepayment is now necessary. So if you fully pay for lodging but then cancel more than 30 days in advance the system will automatically refund your money with no fees? ,Dave's_reviews,Kruger National Park,"Philadelphia, PA"

Hi! Apologies if this has been asked recently but I could not find any postings within a year. A group of us are flying from Chicago to Victoria Falls airport in May of next year and are looking into flights. It seems all flights stop at JNB before we hop a flight to VFA and that there are two flights a day that depart from JNB to VFA and that they are about an hour apart - South African Airways and Airlink. Airlink seems reliable but someone recommended we not take SAA since they completely shut down during COVID and cut many routes once they were back in business. Is SAA a reliable airline? Though we will likely book Airlink (through Qatar or Emirates who have a codeshare with Airlink) I wanted to understand all our options since some of the flights from the US have a codeshare with SAA (e.g. Lufthansa) and possibly more favorable schedules. Thanks in advance! ,Kathy H,,"Chicago, Illinois"
Hello good people of this forum    I’m currently researching our 2nd safari after catching the bug.    Last year we stayed at Vuyani which we thought was fabulous being 1st timers.    This year we’d like to try a different reserve but budget constraints are making this difficult!    I’ve seen what I think is a great deal for this lodge for 4 nights in October. The offer stipulates all inc which is appealing but most providers are full board & more expensive. I’m very tempted to book but wary the all inc might be a mistake….I can call the provider tomorrow but just seeking any advice.    Can anyone advise if the location/game drives should be better than experienced last safari?    I know it is not fenced & this makes me believe it should make for a better overall experience.    Our other option was Elephant plains which is over budget but I could wear hubby down with persuasion if it is a better option.

Hi Everyone - I'll be arriving into OR Tambo at 0330 with my departure on my next flight not until 0930. I did this a few weeks ago and was absolutely shattered. I thought I might try and find a hotel to have a few hours sleep in. This will obviously be a very late check in.  I was wondering if anyone could recommend a hotel to stay in that is easily/safely accessible from the airport where I can check in late.  Seems the City Lodge and Southern sun are the most cost effective and closely located. The intercontinental is £250 so not really worth it for a few hours sleep.    Cheers :) ,Biertje2015,,"London, United..."
We have booked our flights from Dublin to Jo'burg 18th July for 15 nights.  I was born in Yeoville area anc left SA when I was 3.

Hoping for constructive feedback on 11-day August itinerary I have planned for our family of five (2 parents 3 boys aged 17 14 10). First SA visit for kids but my wife and I had an amazing long backpacking visit back in 2000. We are an active Canadian family living in Virginia and have travelled to Taiwan Costa Rica South Korea together organizing everything on our own.    Our main priorities are seeing wildlife and exploring Cape Town Region. This will likely be our only family trip to SA but also trying to keep cost reasonable. Hoped to fly into SA via JNB and out via CPT (or vice versa) on AA points but were only able to get 5 seats in/out of JNB. Haven't booked any internal SA flights yet and have only made hotel/car rental reservations that can be changed/cancelled.    Wed Aug 9 - Arrive JNB 9:15am on overnight flight from LHR pick up Avis rental van drive to Kruger Gate Hotel stopping in Nespruit or Hazyview to stock up on food/drinks. Anything else to see in JNB or en route?  Thur Aug 10 - Full-day guided Kruger game drive through hotel to get feel for park/driving  Fri Aug 11 - Self-drive Kruger game drive(s)  Sat Aug 12 - Self-drive Kruger game drive(s)  Sun Aug 13 - Check out of Kruger Gate Hotel either spend more time in Kruger or maybe drive through Blyde River Canyon spend night in either Nespruit or JNB airport hotel  Mon Aug 14 - Planning to book a JNB-CPT flight pick up Hertz rental SUV then stay at either Protea Hotel in Sea Point or BIG Luxury Backpackers Family Suite  Tue Aug 15 - Thur Aug 17 - Hike Table Mountain & Lions Head visit V&A Waterfront Robben Island Boulders Beach Cape of Good Hope Township tour etc. Other recs?  Thur Aug 17 - Sat Aug 19 - Leave Cape Town and either stay in Oudtshoorn or maybe Mossel Bay visit Cango Caves Ostrich Farm. Other recs? Wineries don't seem like good fit with kids but we might be up for more animals or something active.  Sat Aug 19 - Need to book a flight back to JNB. Thinking about flying from George Airport to avoid driving back to CPT. Flight prices similar and one-way car rental fee not that high. Spend night in JNB airport hotel.  Sun Aug 20 - 7:45am flight JNB-DOH-WAS    Thanks in advance! ,PRS1,,"Crozet, Virginia"
We are going to be in Cape Town in August and want to do a tour of Table Top and a food tour. We have 2 days open to do this which is good because of the weather conditions with Table Top. With that in mind if we book a food tour I am thinking of 1/2 day in case we have to do the Table Top the same day. Is that something we could do? If the weather permits we would do one each day.    For those that have done TT - is it easy enough to do on your own or is a tour recommended? Also any 1/2-day food tour recommendations would be appreciated.    Thank you ,Chris B,Cape Town,"Randall, Minnesota"

Sept 13 flight Jberg to Ctown evening  Sept 13 - 20 cape town (will likely do hop on hop off bus MUST SEE PENGUINS (hope to see ostrich in the wild) and Cape of Good Hope.

Sept 20 morning fly to Durban - THIS IS THE HARD PART:  Sept 20-24 OR 25th (flight not booked)  I had wanted to go to Lesotho - but not sure this is a safe/good idea.  Wanted to stay in a Zulu Village - but not a disney one - maybe a real famiy?  Thought about a one day game drive (different animals in this area?)  National holiday Sept 24 - is there something to see?    I don't care about aquariums. I'm not a particular foodie (but like to try local fare).  I love visiting schools!  I think I should book a driver in Durban/Zulu area?    1. Where to stay in Durban  2. Driver suggestion?  3. Is there a zulu village visitation OTHER THAN Shakaland?  4. Lesotho yes or no (I taught/lived in Bhutan - so I feel like they are sister cities).    THANK YOU SO MUCH for any input! ,Suz S,,"New York City, New..."

Hi  We plan to visit South Africa from Johannesburg at the end of November 2023 and would like some advice on the road conditions etc. … whether we will have any issues with a normal sedan car rental for the following itinerary:  Johannesburg – Bergville (Berghouse & Cottages – 3 nights)  Bergville – Malkerns (Air BnB on a hill – 2 nights)  Malkerns – Kosi Bay (Utshwayelo Kosi Mouth Lodge or Kingfisher Bush Lodge – 2 nights)  Kosi Bay – St Lucia (2 nights)  Return car rental and fly back to Johannesburg from Richard’s Bay Airport  The idea is to relax in self-catering accommodation with views (preferably) explore the nearby areas from our accommodation and not drive around too much to get to places apart from the long drives to get to the next location.  Note: We have done a lot of safaris in the past hence not interested in that during this short trip.  Thanks & look forward to all your suggestions and advice !  May ,May2023,Drakensberg Region,
Hi    We are hoping to travel end May/ beginning of June and I see load shedding has ramped up again. We were in St Lucia in Feb and our accommodation didn't have a generator so it was pretty hot at night and we were unable to charge cameras etc. I know that no generators are allowed between 10pm and 7am in St Lucia but does anybody have any recommendations (other than Leopard Tree Lodge which is full) for places with generators please? Ive looked on booking.com but none of the listings appear to have this information.  When load shedding has been at level 5/6 previously has there been any trouble in the St Lucia area or on the road between Durban and St Lucia? Thanks ,bruisyard,KwaZulu-Natal,United Kingdom
Hi all!    As a South Africa first timer I would love some thoughts on this general timeline for a two week trip over Aug/Sep.    2 nights around Kalk Bay  2 nights Capetown V&A area  2 nights Stellenbosch  2 nights Franschoek  2 nights on safari Little Karoo  2 night Montague  2 night Capetown TBD    I've picked this route in order to take in the Winelands on the way to the safari before making our way back towards the airport but I don't have any particular strong feelings on anything else - is this too much moving around? Not enough? We would like some down time to relax and we'd like to avoid too much driving where possible so if there's any locations that could be rolled in together that would be great (eg could we stay in Franschoek and do day trips to Stellenbosch?) Any particularly nice towns we should try include would be fantastic!    Any advice very much appreciated! ,harto88,,"Dublin, Ireland"
We wonder whether we should have an extra day in Hermanus (we have 2 days and one night) or to have a night somewhere between Hermanus and Cape Town?  Any suggestions most welcome  We would have time for 2 nights Hermanus as well as a stop over between  Thanks ,elaineDevon,Hermanus,devon
My flight from the US first lands at CPT where I will have a 3 hour layover before another flight to JNB. Would it be advisable to get Rand at an airport ATM during this layover? Any concern about safety or scammers? I know that general advice is to use ATM located inside a bank. Are the fees charged by the company providing the ATM higher within the airport? I’m already aware of my bank’s fees. Any other thoughts? Otherwise if I should wait to find a bank ATM the following day can I tip porters etc in USD? ,Gornie,,Washington DC...

We are planning a family trip in either August 2024 or 2025 from the UK and wondered how this itinerary looked. We want to leave enough time to switch off and relax between places (which is why we’ve got 5 nights at a reserve. I know August isn’t the best time of year for Cape Town but we’re restricted when we can travel and I’d love to visit. We gave 2 kids 13/17    3 nights Cape Town  3 night Franschhoek (possibly 1 night in Hermanus). Fly to Durban  3 nights Saint Lucia  5 nights Manyoni (Rhino River or Bayete Private)  1 night Ladysmith (to break the drive)  3 nights Bergville (Montusi)  Return from Johannesburg    Thanks in advance ,trvllvr123,,newcastle
SA 4x4 in Johannesburg have given us a very cheap quote for 4x4 bush camper hire compared to other similar companies. I've tried to look for recent reviews on the internet and 4x4 Africa travel forums for this company but can only find them from 2019 or earlier. Many were poor reviews. The company has an apparently current Facebook page but again no reviews later than 2019. I'm worried it's a scam. Does anyone here have any recent experience with them? ,Sherpa23,,United Kingdom
Hello! First time poster :)    My partner and I will be travelling to South Africa for the first time from the end of August to the beginning of September for 19 days in total. The itinerary is fairy decided by now as we booked safari stays already but any help with the middle part (the garden route and CT) would be appreciated or just some feedback in general on the itineary.    I've highlighted the days I have doubts on. Some questions:    - How would you organise the drive from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town given we have 2 nights to stop along the way? What are the must do activities and/or stops? Are there activities that can be done in the afternoon in Plett or around when arriving or early morning before departing? And what about stops on the way to Hermanus    - In Cape Town we will have a half day (after driving from Hermanus) and a full day to explore. What would you prioritise?    - A full day for wineyards is ok or given the time limit a half day is enough?    Some context on the type of stuff we like hikes (I guess in this case if there are short ones (2h) doable in the afternoon it would be ideal) nature stuff seeing animals (but not interested in another safari as we are doing 3 already) small villages along the coast where you can stop for lunch.    Not interested in adventure type stuff (like ziplines etc.) beach days resorts type villages or fancy seaside towns.    Bonus question: Very out of character for me but I am curious about the white shark cage diving activity. Is it worth it or a waste of money/time? And could it be placed somewhere in the itinerary??    Itinerary    Day 1 - Arrive in Joburg (early morning) visit the city Sleep in Joburg    Day 2 - Visit Joburg Sleep in Joburg    Day 3 - Rent a car and drive to Kruger National park (Pretoriuskop camp & Olifants camp)    Day 4 - 6 Safari    Day 7 - Drive from Olifants to Blyde River Canyon short-ish hike in the afternoon (1h/2h) sleep close to Blyde    Day 8 - Drive to Joburg airport fly to Port Elizabeth sleep in Port Elizabeth    Day 9 - Rent a car drive to Addo Elephant Park sleep in Addo    Day 10 - Early morning safari (Addo) drive to Plett (stops along the way?) night in Plett    Day 11 - Drive to Hermanus (stops along the way?) sleep in Hermanus    Day 12 - Drive to Cape Town explore city sleep CT    Day 13 - Explore Cape Town sleep CT    Day 14 - Wineyards tour sleep CT (close to airport)    Day 15 - Early flight to Upington rent a car and drive to Kalahari sleep in rest camp    Day 16 - 17 Safari Kalahari    Day 18 - Early safari get back to Upington sleep Upington    Day 19 - Fly back to Joburg (morning) and then fly home      Any help would be appreciated!! ,Serena M,,"Barcelona, Spain"
We are a family group of 7 including 3 children. I was thinking that on July 28 2023 we could stop along the way at Camps Bay Haut Bay (maybe a boat ride to the Duiker Island to see the fur seals) stop for the views on Chapman's PeakDrive stop for a quick look at the ostrich farm just before the Cape Point nature reserve visit the Cape of Good Hope take the funicular up to the lighthouse and finally go to the Boulders and Foxy Beach Penguin Colony. Where it works in have lunch at the Cape Point Two Oceans Restaurant then finally visit visit Simons town and Muizenberg. I’d like to be able to adjust for the tides for the best viewing of the penguins as that will be the highlight of our trip. I had found a private tour for 7 for $556 (not including entry fees other than Chapman’s Peak and the beach parking) however we missed out on it. Any suggestions would be appreciated thank you ,Bomma6,,"Edmonton, Canada"

Dear all  I will travel solo as a woman in November to Richards Bay by airplane and I am planning to stay in a lodge in the Munywana Game reserve close to Hluhluwe. I asked some companies for a reliable and safe transfer to the lodge but all these companies are based in Durban making a transfer extremely expensive as they charge me the same amount as if I would take a transfer from Durban. Is there any taxi/shuttle company someone can recommend which is based in Richards Bay or closeby and which is safe to take as a woman travelling alone? Many thanks in advance for your help ,Sandra,Hluhluwe,
Hi  I have a list of hotels for Durban on the golden mile in my favourites list. Some of them are  the Eilangi Belaire Suites The Edward and more. Would it be safe enough to just arrive and walk into a hotel and book a room or should I pre-book it? Most of them on booking dot com want a payment in advanced but with free cancellation. We only want 2 nights then go to Umhlanga for 2 nights  What is your experience in this regard? ,mariannah378,KwaZulu-Natal,"Katikati, New..."

Hi there    We are a couple in our mid-late thirties travelling to SA in early February next year - planning 4 nights in Cape Town to take in the city visit Table Mountain explore the Cape etc - zeroing in on hotels I am trying to make a decision on hotel.....    Choice between a Heritage Deluxe Balcony room at Cloud 9 vs a lovely looking room in Kaap Mooi with a nice big sofa/balcony for about 500 ZAR more per night....    I typically love a more intimate guesthouse experience but the Cloud 9 rooftop is calling to me!    All views appreciated :)    Amy ,Amy Thompson,Cape Town,
Hello! I am hoping to get some opinions on the ease of driving from Cape Town to Cape Point along Chapmans Peak Drive. We will be stopping at Boulders Beach too.    In my country we drive on the right. But we have experience driving in the UK. Would you say the drive is pretty easy or more high-traffic and congested?    For comparison we have driven all over Wales Scotland and a portion of England but we dropped our car off before entering Edinburgh and London because the traffic was overwhelming.    I’m trying to decide if we should rent a car for the day or hire a driver.    Thank you! ,Katie,,"Omaha, Nebraska"

Hi having returned to the UK from a 2 week garden route trip in Feb 23 I am planning my next and thought about KZN with kids aged 12+9 in Oct 24. Flying into Durban the agent suggests Ballito Rhino Ridge and then its sister sites at Kosi and then Thonga which look like (very very nice) beach retreats but beach and snorkelling are not my first choice). I had thought about Saint Lucia to get more animal life does anyone have any knowledge or thoughts? Many thanks ,2mbsy,KwaZulu-Natal,
Hi everyone. I'm traveling on a much anticipated trip to Southern Africa in Aug starting in Cape Town.  Having looked at the Table Mountain website I believe there is cable car maintenance happening the entire time we are there. *cue sad face*  Are there alternate ways to see the view aside from hiking up we're not super fit walkers. I'm thinking of hiring an Uber to takeus up and wait while we look at the view or is that not how it works.  Thanks in advance. :) ,Lisa H,Cape Town Central,"Adelaide, South..."

Hello everyone    Me and my wife are looking to do the garden route this coming september (road trip 3 weeks first time ever driving from cape town - garden route back to cape town) and we are in doubt if we should add on the extra driving hours to go to ADDO national park or take it easier and see buffelsdrift and for example botlierskop instead.    Friends who live in SA advised us to do a loop from capetown (picture attached with an idea of the loop we are making)https://freeimage.host/i/H6c0gqB    Is it really worth it to go all the way to ADDO and does it really feel and look different than for example a game drive in botlierskop and buffelsdrift?    We didnt like the pictures of people hugging elephants in buffelsdrift but what we saw on video at the game drive there and botlierskop it looked nice like all the animals had their freedom.    We are wondering what you think! I am a dutchman and my wife will do all the driving ( i only know how to cycle haha) so she would love to drive the extra hours if its worth it but looking at the videos of the game drives at ADDO we are wondering how much different it will be.    Thank you very much for your response ,Arthur V,Garden Route,"Utrecht, The..."
Hi    my husband and I are planning on a 4 night Safari in June for our 10th anniversary and are really struggling with the lodge decision! Very overwhelming. Game viewing is top then luxurious lodge/tent ideally with exclusive feel really good food and spa. Private pool and gym a plus. We want to soak up the environment and switch off away from our 2 little kids!    We like the intimacy/exclusivity of Klasserie Drift and Siviti but aren’t sure it feels as luxurious. Not sure about the game viewing at Klasserie and while the private pool at Siviti is tempting we’ve heard mixed reviews about food and accommodation.    We like the look (from the marketing) of Thornybush and have the option of 4 nights at Thornybush Game Lodge or a split stay with Saseka which fits the exclusivity/ private pool part of our brief. The price difference is minimal and I’m told the lodges are 20 mins apart but is it worth the move?    We haven’t found many reviews of Thornybush Game Lodge since the renovations. Is it too big and will it give us that privacy exclusive feel still?    Would love to hear thoughts on the 4 lodges and guidance on which seems right for our trip.    Thanks! ,Safi,Kruger National Park,
Hello    I’d appreciate any tips on planning our trip in August as Kruger seems to be extremely overwhelming destination to plan. We are a family of 5 (kids 17 15 and 9) arriving from Johannesburg into Nelspruit and a total of 4 nights. Car rented for self driving to the hotels/resorts.    The ever confusing question of whether to stay inside or outside the park? Staying outside the park seems better for us (better food options: halal food is a must) but then we don’t get the authentic safari experience. Also seems like some lodges inside the park offer halal options too.    Budget is mid range (mid luxury) not too fancy not too basic/budget. This is what I currently have planned:    Day 1:    Arrive in Nelspruit 5 pm. Pick up the car from airport have dinner in Nelspruit and drive to Kruger Eden Lodge in Malroth Park. The reason I chose this lodge is larger family accommodation and excellent reviews.    Is it advisable to drive to Malroth Park late at night?    Day 2:    Private safari for our family (many options on tripadvisor viator etc).    How long would be the expected wait time at Crocodile Bridge Gate? Can we enter in late am or early afternoon or that is not enough time for the game drive?    Day 3: The most confusing part!    Option 1: Stay in Malroth Park/2nd game drive or just relax    Option 2: Drive to Hazyview    Should we drive to Hazyview via the park (self drive safari experience) vs skip the park and go straight to Hazyview?    Option 3: Drive via the park and stay in a camp overnight (have some authentic safari experience at least)    Day 4:    Graskop and Panorama route overnight in Hazyview    Day 5:    Depart from Nelspruit to Cape town.    Thanks for all the help. ,9kdoc9,Kruger National Park,Rochester Hills...

I may be visiting Cape Town in August for around 8 or 9 days and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a full day or maximum two day (1 night) safari?    I did not factor a safari into my CT plans as I may be returning to Africa sometime in the next two years and was planning a full safari holiday in Kenya instead. However I may have one or two days to spare in August and was wondering if a 1 or 2 day safari is worth it?

I am planning a trip to Krueger Park actually SA in Jan 2024 to celebrate my 50th birthday with my boyfriend . The Safari is my dream and it will be my first time. The experience I am looking for is to really to see the animals and a rustic experience not do much luxurious. However safety convenience and cleanliness is equally important. I do not need a Spa or Gym or extremely good food but a pool overlooking the nature accommodation that gives you the view and probably to spot wildlife.    I have read Kruger National park & Greater Kruger Park are different. My questions  if I would spend 7 days :  1. Could I split the accomadation to have the best experience?  2. How should I split it ?  3. Would a mix of luxurious and semi-luxurious be affordable?  4. Any other tips after Kruger experience? I will spend s total of 3 weeks in SA ,Rubita R,Kruger National Park,"Sintra, Portugal"
Hello  Trying to decide between Amakhala or Lalibela.  Bukela Lodge at Amakhala is coming out a lot cheaper $1200 for 2 people 2 nights vs  Lentaba/Inzolo Lodge at Lalibela $1900 and  Kichaka Lodge at Lalibela is $2700.  This trip is for our honeymoon so whilst we are happy to splurge I am wondering if Lalibela is worth the extra money over Amakhala?

Hi! A group of us will soon be booking flights from Chicago USA to the Victoria Falls airport in Zimbabwe. It seems all flights from Chicago have a layover at JNB before departing for Vic Falls. How long of a layover at JNB should we have to ensure we make the flight? We'd go on airlines Qatar/Airlink or Lufthansa/South African air and those airlines have code shares so I'm assuming we can check our bags all the way from Chicago to Vic Falls but please correct me if I'm wrong. Right now the flights we like are using Qatar from Chicago to JNB and Airlink to VFA with a 1 hr 40 min layover at JNB. Is that enough time?

Hi all for the first time i feel out my comfort zone when looking for a holiday. Misses 40th next year and we are planning to go on a safari yet we have little knowledge on this type of holiday. Within saying that we feel that we'd be better booking through one of our local travel agents in our town.    we have been spoke with them this weekend and they have provided us with a few options for next May time. Both are with Newmarket Holidays and offer something slightly differnet yet around the same price of £2500-2750 each.    1st is Mabula Lodge which includes Seven nights’ full-board accommodation at the Mabula Game Lodge Six safaris into the Mabula Private Game Reserve plus a wildlife talk bush walk visit to the Hornbill Project a bush lunch stargazing and a sundowner in the bush.    2nd is Go in search of the Big Five as you take three safaris in the famous Kruger and Greater Kruger National Park (one full day two morning safaris) Seven nights’ carefully chosen accommodation including one at the five-star African Pride Irene Country Lodge near Pretoria and six at Camp Bethel. Visit at a local wildlife rehabilitation centre  Picturesque panoramic tour taking in some of the Lowveld and the Blyde River Canyon’s best sights  Gentle guided nature walk at Camp Bethel  Fascinating Nyani cultural village tour including dance performance    The Kruger one has less Safari's but offers more experience's and the misses is pretty interested in doing that one..

We leave UK in less than a week and will be in Makalali Game Reserve on 12th June (2023) for 3 nights. Therefore we've not had any real proper time to look up and revise on our 3-day trip to Makalali game reserve. Our Itinerary says that we are entitled to 2 Safaris per day. Are they set times? Do we go with other tourists? How long are they? Do we take clothes for cold morning weather or clothes for Hot weather? Is there anything we should know? Any items that we should buy in the UK before we leave? Any specific clothing requirements or footwear?  Sorry for the short notice.  Thanks all. ,William R,,"Manchester, United..."

Hi everybody- if you had 12 days to spend how would you divide them between a Garden Route and a Cape Town area? How many days would you dedicate to each? All your tips appreciated too:-) ,Štěpánka Č,,"Ostrava, Czech..."
Is it a good idea to split between the 2 areas to optimise the experience? I have contacted Kambaku RS for Timbavati and was thinking about the Kruger Salati Train on Bridge for Skukuza. Anyone had any experience on these 2 places? And of course if you have any other recommendations within the area ?  It is a special trip as I want to celebrate my 50th birthday there ,Rubita R,,"Sintra, Portugal"
I'm traveling from Satara to Manyeleti Private Reserve by self-drive car. Do I have to exit via Orpen gate and re-enter to come to Manyeleti? Or can I stay inside KNP and enter Manyeleti directly?    That seems a little redundant. ,terlar,Kruger National Park,

Dear all    We've got an oncoming trip to Skukuza SZK from Europe (Frankfurt FRA) via JNB. We've got two plane tickets: One from FRA to JNB back to FRA and one from JNB to SZK back to JNB. Layover times are long enough (5+ hours).    We're currently unsure how to transit from international to national flights (or vice versa) in JNB: I assume we have to get our checked luggage from the luggage belt (when coming from FRA or SZK) and then transit to the national/international terminal. Where do we re-check our luggage then? Do we have to leave airside and go to landside or can we stay airside? Are there baggage drop counters near the transit zone?    Thanks for any information!

Hi there    I've wanted to visit south Africa for a while now and as my kids are teenagers and am thinking of going next year. I think the place we want to base ourselves is cape town we want to see the penguins be in a city with a good vibe and restaurants and it seems to look like it ticks the boxes. But apart from that I am getting f overwhelmed on where we should go for a safari.    Rough plan of 14 nights I am    6 nights capetown  3 nights safari (I've looked at knp but it seems a bit far and plane away but not sure if it's easy enough to do our requirements are something easy safe and gives a good enough experience without being too adventurous    so am wondering if there's game parks a bit more near Durban or Capetown.    2 nights not sure maybe Durban    3 nights somewhere relaxing maybe a flight to a beach resort perhaps.    At this stage the plan would be around September.    Appreciate any guidance on where I should start ,SydneyK,,"Sydney, Australia"

Curious if anyone knows if animals are either attracted to or dislike the scent from bug spray? Debating if I should not apply any because I would think they wouldn’t want to come around once they get a hit of the lemon/deets type scent. What’s your opinions? Mosquitos don’t really bother me just reading it’s recommended. Will be out there June 18th. Thanks! ,Gino V,,"Chicago, Illinois"
Time got away from me but just wanted to give a shout out to those that provided awesome feedback suggestions etc for my South Africa Trip    Briefly    After part of the larger trip I flew to Cape town and headed via Uber to Stellenbosch where I spent 3 days.    If you're headed to Stellenbosch definitely do the hop on/off vine hopper winery. It was very efficient easy and you have different 'trail' options. Very enjoyable and the town is great plenty of wine to try and restaurants. The Fat Butcher was a place I was thinking about going to and every person I asked on the wine tour suggested it when I asked where to eat. It was probably the best meals I had in South Africa . De Warenmarkt was also very good as well as Jardin Wine Bar and Plaisir Wine & Gin Lounge where I just had a nice wine flight and tapas.    Then it was off to Cape Town stayed in Sea Point area. While there I did table mountain & Bo-Kaap VFA waterfront and did a lot of walking through the city over 5 days. Took a day tour which included Cape of Good Hope Bantry Bay Clifton Chapman's Peak 12 Apostles Simon's Town Penguin Colony etc. Also did the Robben Island Museum and although I am glad I did it am not sure it's worth the time/money. It's not the most organized tour IMO and unless you do the 1st tour of the day and spend more you can't get out wander around etc so as much as I love history and doing those things felt it was a bit disappointing. With that said as much as I think they should do a better job still think people should do it.    Flew to Johannesburg and headed to Mabula Game Lodge for 2 nights/3 days. The lodge was nice my room was large with giant windows and although no major wild life did see a ton of mongoose and some monkeys. The drives were nice and we saw everything over the course of them Rhino Elephants Zebra Wild Dogs Giraffe Impala bird etc. Food was good service was good no complaints. I'd say if you are going to do the organized drives I did prefer Masi Mara in Kenya over this but it was great.    Flew to Kruger and spend 5 days self driving which is 100% a must do!! I stayed at various camps and I drove 1000km in the 5 days. You name it I saw a lot of it ha ha. Tons and tons of Elephants Giraffe and Impala. Rhino Cheetah Lions Hippos and even saw a Leopard in a tree with it's kill. I wouldn't say the camps were amazing but they suit their purpose well. Restaurants were pretty good some very good plenty of stuff available in the shops to eat drink etc. This was without question the highlight of the trip and I see why people go for weeks.    After this I spent a day/night in Hazyview so I could get in some natural landscape drives hiking before flying back to JNB and then to the US    That's the brief overview I will WITHOUT QUESTION be returning to South Africa to see more and am sure to be asking more questions. Thanks again!! ,TrvlnewBee,,"Orlando, Florida"
We are going to be in Cape Town & Stellenbosch in September. A few questions - Is it safe to drive ourselves in the Stellenbosch area for wine tours?

My partner and I arrive in Cape Town in a few days and looking for som recommendations for great food and drinks preferably good value too.

Also what are some the best cafes? ,ndilly,Cape Town,"Toronto, Canada"
Dear Friends for our 25th marriage anniversary in early December we have shortlisted to be at Cape town. I have gone through past posts and looks like Table Mountain Boulders Beach Cape Point  Robben Island and Kirstenbosch gardens are no brainers with off course the Table Mountain. Do you guys think this is doable in 4.5 days ? Too rushed ? Also we have to go to Joburg mainly for safari . Is that safari something that is doable based out of CPT ? i can avoid Joburg completely. Or alternatively is one day for safari good enough if i try cover the same from Joburg. Our idea mainly is to cover Cape Town in entirety and safari as a second choice. ,Nawal G,Cape Town,"Singapore, Singapore"
Would love to hear people’s experiences. We are traveling from America with 2 kids to South Africa.Our travel agent said we need unabridged birth certificates.

I’m trying to buy an International Wild Card for my trip to SA in July but I can’t find the link anywhere on the Sanparks site. When I try to go through the “purchase a wild card” bit I get asked about “beneficiaries” which seems to be about adding a person with a disability. There’s no skip option.

Just want to make sure I understand this. Are the entrance fees and conservation fees the same thing?    We have 6 nights booked between skukuza and olifants for 4 international people. So the total conservation fee would be around 11000 rand. I assume we are better off getting the WILD card for the family? Is that the only fee or am I missing something?

Hi  M husband and I are visiting South Africa from 14th September. We are keen gardeners and have Kirstenbosch gardens down as a “must see”.  However as we are driving from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth via Franschhoek Swellendam Knysna etc. I was wondering if we would see any wild flowers on the journey and if so where the best places to see them would be.  Thank you ,Alison Denison,Cape Town,
Hello  I would be grateful for some assistance in planning my trip. I have 3 nights before we commence our Kruger Park week entering at the Malelane or Paul Kruger gate.

Would appreciate help and suggestions please to make this a trip to remember! ,Mel Poole,Johannesburg,
So we have returned from our family holiday to Cape Town. We travelled as a couple with two children aged eight and 11 from the UK.    We were aware it was the colder season – this made the holiday more affordable for us. We had a mix of sunshine and pleasant temperatures and a couple of pretty rainy days but it didn’t really stop us doing anything.    We spent the first half of the week staying at the Taj hotel in the city centre. This was a fabulous hotel with amazing service and a very comfortable room. it was within walking distance to some attractions but we also utilised Uber-particularly at night!    The second half of our week was spent at a rental in De Waterkant. We did this via Waterkant Cottages who were brilliant and our house was wonderful with a hot tub on the roof terrace. Really liked this area- Nice restaurants shops et cetera. Very pretty with different coloured houses.    In terms of activities we climbed Table Mountain. We did Platteklip gorge which took us just over an hour and a half. It was steep but doable even with the children. Obviously views fantastic. We got the cable car down. We did it on a Sunday morning and the atmosphere was great with lots of camaraderie from other hikers.    We spent time in the Company’s Gardens which are beautiful and there’s a nice café there ideal for children. We also visited the African Museum which is at the top of the gardens. Really interesting way to spend a couple of hours.    The V&A was soggy when we visited but we enjoyed the Cape Wheel nonetheless although the views obscured. The aquarium was a great rainy day activity.    We drove to Cape of Good Hope/Cape point/Boulders Beach. Really easy drive with some lovely scenery. Well worth a day trip.    We went to Hout Bay and did a seal Island cruise with Circe launches. Very reasonably priced and thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family. Absolutely stunning scenery and so many seals as you would expect.    The Spier winery provided a great lunch at Vada’s plus time with the birds at Eagle encounters. We particularly enjoyed this. The staff are wonderful and we got hands-on contact with the birds foxes and even a porcupine.    We visited the botanical gardens which were very atmospheric and beautiful even on a misty day.    We had some great meals out whilst we were there. We particularly enjoyed cousins Trattoria Den Anker Life Grand Cafe and Gold restaurant.    The latter provides an African experience complete with a drumming lesson and entertainment including face painting.    Any questions-just ask! ,Starshaped,Cape Town,"Colchester, United..."
Hi Everyone    Your advice and knowledge would be greatly appreciated.    My husband and I are trying to add 4 nights to our Sabi Sand booking for beginning of October. Through an agent we have made enquiries with Serondella Senalala and Honeyguide camps in Manyeleti. All are fully booked which we understand because of the short notice & it’s a popular time of year and budget    The agent has suggested Simbavati Amani as an alternative but I have struggled to find independent reviews. Did it use to belong to Klasserie Drift? If anyone can advise or has been I’d be most grateful for your feedback    Thanks for your help and advice 😊 ,Lisaloolah,,

We are putting the final touches to our itinerary for a trip in Nov/Dec. Most of it is booked but we'd like to spend the last couple of days back in CT.  Our flight home doesn't leave until 9pm on our last day so my question is would most places be happy to store our luggage and let us use the facilities there (not our room obviously) until we need to go to the airport?

I'm visiting Cape Town for 6 nights in mid September and I'm wondering where's the best place to stay for a first time visit. I've been looking at hotels in Sea Point but not sure if I'd be better staying at V&A.

Hi all!    Background: my partner and I are planning a 1 month honeymoon in Africa for summer 2024. Neither of us have ever been to the continent but have otherwise traveled widely and are comfortable travelers.    Our must-do's are:  1. Cape Town  2. Vineyards  3. Safari  4. Mauritius (fiancé's only request so this is an absolute must)    My questions:  1. Is there anything else we must add? Victoria Falls sounds awesome but I am wondering how difficult to get to it would be?  2. Where should we do a safari? Originally I was thinking Tanzania or Kenya but South Africa or Botswana would likely be easier. However we're also going for an extended period and for the first time (and likely won't be back soon) so would love to explore as much as we can without over committing!  3. How easy is it to rent a car? What about flying country to country?  4. Should we get a travel agent? How worth it is that?    Thanks in advance!  S ,ASavinkina,,

Hi everyone    My husband and I are travelling to Cape Town for the 1st time for two weeks in mid January 24. We will split our two weeks between a couple of hotels but looking for some suggestions on which areas are the best. As much as we will be out n about exploring I would still like to base the stay around a beach resort if possible at least for half the stay. Been looking at Camps Bay which is my favourite area but the one I really want is so expensive. From what I've read taxi's are cheap so shouldn't really matter too much where we stay but would still be nice to be able to walk out to a few nice restaurant's/bars etc. Any suggestions/recommendations to help me starting planning the itinerary?

Hi all  I’m travelling to Jo-burg in September. Planning to stay for two nights to over come jet lag and then travel on (and return to Jo for a few days for touring before return to the States). I’ll be spending most of my time in Zambia visiting a friend from when I worked in Namibia in 2005.    I’m writing to ask for recommendations for a cool economical (less than $100 USD per night) lodging for these two nights. I’ve been looking online and seeing a lot of cool spots. I will probably spend most of that day at the premises. A fitness center nice gardens on site restaurant are all desirables. An attraction within close proximity would also be nice to get out for a few hours – but nothing too strenuous. Luxury is always fun but something cool kitschy and bo-ho-ish would be really fun. Mostly I am looking for relaxation after 20+ hours of travel. I know that hidden gems are often buried (or online listings employed a phenomenal photographer!) :-)    Appreciate any suggestions! Thanks! Amanda ,aspletter,Johannesburg,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
I'm looking to book a rental car for 83 days beginning in July.    I found a Toyota Corolla Quest with unlimited miles on the Avis Monthly Rentals for International Visitors site for $2400. This does not come with full insurance coverage.    Using the consolidator Rentalcars.com I found a Toyota Corolla Quest (with unlimited miles and full insurance coverage) from Woodford Car Hire for $2000. Surprisingly Rentalcar.com prices a SUV - Toyota Urban Cruiser (or similar) with unlimited miles and full coverage for the same $2000.    That raises a red flag as the SUV should be significantly more expensive than a compact Toyota.    When I go to Woodford Car Hire directly and check a Toyota Urban Cruiser with full coverage and unlimited miles comes to $4000.    How can booking through a consolidator - Rentalcar.com - be 50% less for the same car from the same company Woodford Car Hire? I've emailed both Rentalcars.com and Woodford and asked this question.    Rentalcars.com replied We get our prices directly from the rental car companies. Meanwhile Woodford has not replied.    The old adage 'if it sounds too good to be true...' comes to mind.    Does anyone have experience with Rentalcars.com or should I just stick with the what I consider more trustworthy Avis? ,Dave,Kruger National Park,San Diego...

Entering via Mata-Mata from Namibia and plan to spend a week in Kgalagadi in the end of September. I thought I should stock up on supplies in Keetmanshoop since I know that there's limited fresh produce and meat available in the shops in Mata-Mata and Nossob. What am I allowed to bring over the border in terms of fruit vegetables egg and meat? Where can I find official info on this? I'm obviously using the wrong terms and search words in Google... We are leaving the park again through Mata-Mata as well to continue our journey in Namibia. Perhaps this means that I will not cross a veterinary/fruit/veg border control...?

We are booked to hire a car from a company called BLU ..it was arranged by the travel agent.

We are planning on coming to the KTP next year and will book as soon as bookings open. Hopefully we will be lucky and get the camps we would really like but will be happy as long as we get somewhere really.  Rather than use our roof top tent we decided that we would book into chalets and hopefully be able to enjoy a couple of the wilderness camps. However I have read some reports of bats in the chalets and not just an odd one but numerous bats. Now I know that they do a good job in eating insects etc and I do try to think of them as my friends but..........I'm not sure how much sleep I would get with bats whizzing about in the chalet.    What are folks experiences regarding this ie: are certain camps worse than others etc etc. ,redrose59,Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park,Aberdeenshire...

Hi! Eight of us booked a trip to Zimbabwe and South Africa for mid-late May 2024. We'd need to fly from Vic Falls airport to CPT on a Saturday. I started looking at flights and it seems Saturday is the only day of the week that there are no direct flights in May. We strongly prefer a direct flight and not one that goes through JNB first in order to maximize efficiency with our time and moving our itinerary around is not an option. Does anyone know of airlines that fly this route direct on Saturdays in May? Is it possible that direct flights open up later in the year for Saturdays?

Our family of 6 parents plus 4 boys ages 8-18 will be in S Africa for 3-4 weeks in January and/or February. We will spend about half the time in CT then a few days in Johannesburg then Krueger.    I realize this isn’t the ideal time for a safari but it’s when we will be there. So how to make the most of it? We are not exactly a rugged family and budget is not a huge concern.    Should we self tour? Stay in a lodge on a private reserve? Rent a serviced home? We want to see animals (of course) and be relatively comfortable when we are not out on a drive.

I’m quite familiar with the Cape Town area but this time I also want to visit the Rorke’s Drift museum and take the battlefield tours near there. From my Google searches I’m not seeing a lot of accommodation options nearby. Has anyone visited this area and stayed in a place they would recommend that is safe and not extremely expensive?  Thanks in advance for any insight. ,Nicole C,,"Calgary, Canada"
Hi i want to visit Kruger NP Garden route Hermanus and Cape Town in 10 days. Could someone suggest a good Itinerary? I am planning to visit SA in September is it a good time to spot wildlife and whales and to visit SA in general? ,Smruti,,"Bengaluru, India"
Hello friends  Family travel: 2 adults 1 teen 1 preteen. We are planning a 7 nights trip from US to SA in early July. While safari is the central focus of the trip for sure and we have booked the 1st 3 nights of the trip at Shamwari (eastern cape reserve) we are looking for options to make the overall trip a bit more varied. Cape Town would be cold i heard so we ruled that out. If there is something interesting that's not safari for next 2 days we could do that and then again do maybe 2 more nights at Kruger for another round of safari. Open to locations around the country and no specific budget. Any suggestions? ,KC_20142014,,"Gilbert, Arizona"
I want to spend some time in Krueger Park via MQP airport and also in Capetown. Is it better to fly into one city from abroad then fly to the other city  then fly home from there via two one way flights or RT to Joberg and inter country flights to each place? ,Notsure,,Los Angeles...
I talked today with a travel agent that said that Krueger is heavily poached  illegally hunted and had a poor amount of wildlife compared to Tanzania Zimbabwe Botswana and others. He recommend for a low priced safari I do a guided trip to another country. I realize companies sell tours. What’s the quantity of wildlife sightings in Krueger vs of African countries? I need to decide if it’s worth paying more and not visit Krueger. ,Notsure,,Los Angeles...
Hi all    Very early days of planning an increasingly serious option for a 16-day-trip is South-Africa. We will be renting a car and accommodating ourselves. We are very experienced backpackers couple in our 30s. However we do opt for luxury where possible (private rooms/hotels over dorms).    For New Years Eve we'd like to have a good party. Presumably (preferably even) in one of the big cities. We'd like to know if a particular city is recommended? Also whether it's safe and/or a good idea to go out and party? In case it matters: We are a mixed couple and like all kinds of music (easy going).    Regarding Christmas I guess the main question is: Should we consider some venues/parks/sights to close down? What is nice alternatives?    Thanks all for helping out!  L ,Leroy K,,"Utrecht, The..."
Hello all and thanks in advance for your advice    I've read conflicting information online about the safety of Nelspruit in recent years. We (31 year old couple) are planning on flying to Nelspruit picking up a car at the airport and driving to Kruger spending the first night at Skukuza and then driving back to Nelspruit after our safari and flying out again.    We won't be spending anytime in Nelspruit itself so would people say it's safe to do this drive?    In addition are there any recommendations for a grocery store easily accessible from the airport where we can pick up some stuff as we're planning on being mostly self catering while in the park.    Many thanks    Dec ,Declan S,Nelspruit,

I will be in cape town first week in july and our return flight to lusaka zambia has 2 parts :  - flysafair from cape town to JNB. 5:45 am >> 7:45 am  - Ethiopian Airline from JNP to lusaka. at 9:45 am    I have booked that flight as it was the cheapest among later ones but after that i got afraid that the time will be too tight.  Any idea if flysafair usually lands on time and will we get time to check in ?  Is the international terminal far from the domestic one ?    Please any advice will be appreciated  Thank you ,Mina A,,"Lavington, Kenya"
I am looking to do 3-4 nights in Greater Kruger and have narrowed down my options to the below. The trip would be like a second honeymoon for me and my partner. This would be part of a larger trip that also combines Cape Town / Winelands where I would be spending 4-5 days depending on how long the safari leg is. This is also our first safari. Any thoughts on comparisons would be much appreciated.    Sabi Sabi Earth Lodge  Singita Boulders  Singita Lebombo or Sweni  Royal Malewane Lodge or Farmstead  AndBeyond Tengile River    Really looking for overall the best service / experience - we are big into food and fine wine so that is also important but quality of the game drives is paramount (without sacrificing overall experience). Ideally the lodge would be more couples oriented and exclusive.    Sabi Sabi Earth Lodge seems to be more affordable relative to other options but seems a smaller concession area than some of the other options - the rooms look quite nice but is the service / food & wine on par with others on the list? Seems like it is arguably lower quality in terms of game dries vs. Singita (and the price reflects that) but is it a significant enough difference? Would probably do 4 nights on a stay 4 / pay 3 deal.    Singita Boulders seems to come at premium vs. every other option on this list but potentially the best for game drives within Sabi Sands (Londolozzi is no longer an option and would have been in contention)? The service / food & wine seem to be top notch as would be expected at Singita. Would probably only do this for 3 nights given higher relative cost vs. others on this list.    I also read great things about Singita Lebombo / Sweni but is the game density less? It does seem to be quite a bit more scenic with amazing views from the rooms; but neither have private pools in the suites and they are more elevated. I am somewhat into the idea of having suites that are closer to the bush rather than elevated to have the animals potentially closer - for example I see many reviews of Royal Malewane and elephants drinking out of pools which would be quite special. Singita / Sweni seems to have a good deal for 4 nights; otherwise 3 nights is just as expensive as Boulders so does not feel good value given no private pool/potentially less concentrated wildlife. However the concession is larger. Would I be missing out on being in Sabi Sands?    Royal Malewane seems to tick all of my boxes for service / knowledgeable staff / food & wine but again am I missing out on Sabi Sands? Will the game viewing be markedly inferior? Is 3-4 nights enough / too much? If anyone has stayed at both Farmstead and the Main Lodge how do they compare; which location has more wildlife around the lodge? They also have a deal for a free night if staying in one of their other properties in SA so this could be an option to do with La Residence. The safari part of this trip is most important but that would be a good bonus.    AndBeyond Tengile River looks beautiful as well and located adjacent to Singita Boulders so I imagine similarly good location (although I am only surmising). The suites look excellent. Food / wine / service seem good as well but there is generally less datapoints out there given it is newer and really only operated a year before COVID. For this same reason I have not read enough on the quality of the game drives. Would consider 3-4 nights here as well as it's priced more in line with Malewane.    Any perspectives on comparisons much appreciated! ,RM,Kruger National Park,"New York City, New..."
I see on their website that they offer a 2 bedroom option which is pretty reasonabley priced. Has anyone stayed here who can tell me what the hotel is like and the size of the room? Is it actually 2 rooms or one divided? Just trying to get a feel as it might be a good option for us. It's difficult to contact the hotel as they do not seem to have an email listed on the website.

Hello everyone  We are a family of 8 including children young adults and seniors. It’s out first trip to SA. Would like your suggestion on which game drive would you suggest? We plan to visit in July 3rd week.  Our initial itinerary is as follows:  Arrive at Johannesburg and head to Hoedspruit local flight.  3 nights at a recommended lodge or hotel for game drives. Please give me your recommendations  Our kids are 79 and 11. So looking for game drives that allow these ages.  Head to Cape Town by flight stay 4 nights around V&A waterfront.  Head to Whale Coast (Stanford) stay 3 nights.  Head to Knynsa on Garden Route 4 nights followed by Frankschhoek for 2 nights and exit SA from Cape Town.    How does this itinerary look? We will not be self driving and am looking for transportation shuttle service with driver to take us around I understand it will be more expensive but none of us are comfortable driving.  I’m also not sure on the distances between each place. ,tictactic,,World

Hi Everyone - I'm looking at some options for Sabi Sand in October and Silvan has come up with a stay 4 pay 3 special.  I've been in the northern Sabi Sand quite a few times and always had amazing game drives but it would be great to get some insight into whether the lodge is worth it (subjective I know).    I was wondering if any of the regulars had been and could provide any feedback or reviews? There are plenty of 5 star reviews but I'd rather trust the insights of bush regulars to provide some of the nuances and comparisons to other lodges.  One review I did find mentioned that the food was not up to scratch which is a shame as that seems to be one area they really push.    The other options in this price range with a similar deal seems to be Mala Mala. Does anyone have any thoughts on the Silvan vs Mala Mala debate :)?    I know a lot of people mention Mala Mala being away from the fences whereas Silvan will have some fence lines nearby.    Cheers :) ,Biertje2015,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,"London, United..."

We have reservations inside Kruger park for August and were planning to rent a car to drive there. Taking a flight to Skukuza or Nelspruit is too expensive for 4 people. However I am very nervous about driving outside the park it seems protests are increasing and sometimes no notice among other reasons.    So I was thinking to maybe go for a safari package instead yo avoid any driving. But I am not sure if it would be worthy staying outside the park and going for only 2-3 drives? More it becomes very expensive. What are your experiences?. ,imolinar,,"Abu Dhabi, United..."
Hi all    We are coming to South Africa (& through Africa) and need to purchase some soft luggage (15-20kg capacity) as our hard shell case suitcases aren't allowed for some of the smaller flights throughout Africa.

i will have limited time in South Africa when I visit in December. Rather than make independent arrangements I am wondering if there is a 3 day tour of Kruger I can take from Johannesberg. I could probably start in Mbombela (or is it Nelspruit still?) if necessary. The few options I have looked at have a minimum requirement of 2 people per booking but I will be traveling alone.    Recommendations for tour providers is greatly appreciated. Or should I try to do that as self arranged? The remainder of my trip will be booked independently.    Thanks. ,davidm59,,"Detroit, Michigan"

Good morning    I know this may feel like a loaded question and may get differing opinions but we're looking for some up to date advice regarding safety in and around Durban. We are a 31 year old couple used to exercising basic levels of caution while travelling (not looking flash not walking around with phones out taking advice from people who approach on the street etc)    We are staying in Umhlanga for 3 nights and will head into Durban city for one day with a hire car likely parking down near uShaka marine world and going for an explore down the front area would this be safe to do?    Another thing we want to do is to drive the Midlands meander leaving the airport with a hire car and travelling via the N2/N3 down past Durban Pinetown and Pietermaritzburg. Again would people say this is a safe thing to do?    Lastly my girlfriend spent some time living in Hillcrest just to the northwest of Pinetown around 12 years ago she would like to go back there and show me around but is concerned whether the area is safe nowadays and none of her old friends still live in the area to contact. Is Hillcrest a safe area to visit? And also is it safe to visit the 1000 hills?    Many thanks in advance for any advice people are able to provide.    Dec ,Declan S,Durban,

I will be flying into CPT at 6:30 pm from Washington then transferring to a SA Airlink flight to JNB at 6:40 pm. I assume I’ll go through Passport Control at CPT not sure if I’ll have to collect my luggage for Customs. I’ll be returning to CPT after a domestic flight from a safari. To reduce weight for internal flights does it make sense to bring a carry-on bag with items I won’t need for the safari; leave it at a left luggage concession at CPT during the layover; and pick it up 10 days later when I return on my domestic flight?    Among the issues are whether I will have to change from the international terminal to the domestic one (or will I be doing that anyway for my JNB flight) and will I have enough time. Thanks in advance for your advice. ,Gornie,Cape Town,Washington DC...

Hi    Thinking about going to Kruger in January for 6/7 nights and considering Arathusa and another lodge in a different reserve.    1) Is there a significant difference between reserves (Sabi Sands vs Timbavati/ Klaserie)? Is it worth splitting the stay?  2) Any opinions on Bateleur Safari Camp? Thinking if it would be worth to combine Arathusa with a more rustic experience maybe Bateleur or Nthambo  3) If have any opinions on how Simbavati River Lodge and Kambaku River Sands compare to Arathusa would appreciate it ,oli1170,Kruger National Park,

Hello everybody!  Starting to plan our 2024 trip to SA  probably 18 days or so  we are a (young) retired couple in our 60’  Very active .

Hi all    I am taking my wider family on a trip to Western Cape in 2 weeks for 2 weeks and am considering how best to make sure everyone is connected (17 people will be splitting up into smaller groups).    I have seen good reviews for Airalo and I have recommended this to my family. It will I believe allow the user to keep the same number. However not devices are compatible including my own.    As an alternative for those who can't use Airalo I will suggest we get PAYG sims at the airport from Vodacom. However for those of us who do this it would mean getting a new number.    So I was thinking of buying a Vodacom dongle(s) with PAYG SIM cards - our phones then connecting wirelessly to the dongle. This I believe would allow the retention of the same number.    My questions are:  - Is it it possible to buy a dongle and PAYG sim from Cape Town airport?  - Is proof of address required if bought at the airport (or is this only for contracts for outside the airport or a myth)?  - If we go for the PAYG SIM-in-phone option resulting in a new number does this play havoc with (e.g.) Whatsapp?  - If I buy a Vodaphone dongle in UK will it with a PAYG sim work in SA on the Vodacom network?  - Do you have any other comments/suggestions about this plan?    This stuff has been a steep learning curve for me so I may have got the wrong end of the stick somewhere.    Thanks ,Madthinker M,Cape Town,Antananarivo...

Hi everyone!    My husband and I are heading to South Africa in September and unfortunately we only have 24h in Johannesburg (sad but it is what it is). We are landing really early at around 6am on Saturday and will be leaving Johannesburg at around 10am next morning as well.    We will be staying near OR Tambo airport due to that reason. We have looked at some day tours but thought that the combination of Apartheid museum Constitution Hill and Soweto might be a bit too rushed for a day tour much as we like to have ample time for the museums and to take in the history and culture here.    Hence between Constitution Hill and Apartheid museum what is your personal pick and why? Or if you think we should go to both places and drop Soweto do let us know too! ,707shawnee,Johannesburg,"Singapore, Singapore"

Hi all - we are going to Cape Town for the first time at the end of June for a few days before driving on to Namibia (4x4 with RTT).    I am looking for advice how safe the N7 is - we are planning to leave early on a Monday morning and hope to make it to Noordoewer in daylight.    I read that one section just North of Cape Town (towards Potsdam Road Malibongwe Drive and Sandown Road) is considered as unsafe. Is this correct and if yes - is there a safer alternative route?    Also - how long is the drive realistically going to take? Or should we plan to overnight in Springbok.    Many thanks. ,0ekk,,"Wellington, New..."

I just want to know if this is do-able. My reservations are having the car from Durban which seems expensive when we wouldn’t really be using it. I know the option would be to do this as a tour if I could just do this part as a tour it would be fine but I don’t want to spend the entire holiday in a group. ,LisaJ,,"Lincoln, United..."

If you don't have a rental car what is the best way t get from one game preserve to another? I am thinking about staying a few days at one and then going to stay at another.

Morning    I hope you can help. I travel from UK to Jo’berg in June and will transit through to Mozambique via Airlink.  Firstly is this a domestic transfer?    Secondly my flight arrival from UK is 0910. My airlink flight departs at 1135.  I have read other queries and gather I will have to collect my luggage and go through check in again but I am wondering if this is too tight a transfer time. There are limited option sadly.    Thankyou….I’m a solo traveller so a bit worried! ,Sarah H,Johannesburg,southport

Hi all    without meaning to sound lazy/ignorant - how would you describe S.Africa as different from say; the more popular beach honeymoon places with Western tourists? eg: Bali SE Asia (Thailand etc) beach resort type holidays for newly weds.    Does SA have a range of coastal resorts or is it more of an active holiday i.e safaris and moving around?    In Ireland South Africa would still be a very alternative destination anyway - although it is becoming increasingly popular for honeymoons - a former work colleague recently toured the wine country and SA for 2 weeks before heading over to Mauritius for 1 week.    We (F29 & M30) will be going on honeymoon after our wedding in early June next year 2024! We'll be flying out from Dublin    We HAVE done extensive research for a number of destinations -    done our own research - various articles travel guides cost comparisons (spreadsheets!) etc    looked at the weather and activities for each destination    We are struggling to choose between South Africa and Bali for minimum 2 weeks - 3 weeks our budget is probably upto £7K GBP/€8K Euro    We want to do a stopover if possible in either Istanbul or Dubai and stay for a couple of nights there as part of the trip.    We like luxury places for relaxation but we also like lots of choice to eat outside of our accomodation in local restaurants for breakfast lunch and dinner. We have never done all inclusive or half board. We wouldn't want to go somewhere that's dead or nothing happening in the remote area.    In contrast to the above we are also not after a city break or lots of public transport needed unless it was a small part of the trip been there done that its not relaxing even though we're both physically fit and healthy. Large crowded places are not attractive either.    Thank you very much in advance! We are looking to book by September 2023. Enjoyed reading all your posts on here. ,Kilash,,County Donegal...

Hello  We are going to South Africa and plan to do city tour and stay in lodges for safari.  1) on safari do you tip your guide/ranger at end of stay or each day? And if do how much?  2) for the city tour guide what is tipping etiquette?  3) driver taking us to/from airport?    Thx so much for any guidance ,NYC1240,,New York

We have narrowed down our choice to these 2 lodges in Madikwe. Party of 2 adult women staying 4 nights. Arrive October 1 depart October 5.  Rhulanilooks beautiful and is on the east side and is interesting because of the add-on excursions they offer to the village to Gabarone and across to the west to the anti-poaching center. We were thinking this would be a good fit for a 4 night stay if we take advantage of the excursions.  Madikwe Safari Lodge is beautiful and is usually recommended by travel agents when I request information. They offer all the amenities that Rhulani does but not the extra excursions.It is on the east side.  Has anyone stayed at Rhulani or Madikwe or both to be able to give information? If you have been on the excursions was it worth the time? FYI the excursions are timed to take place between safaris during the day.  I am told the east is more lush and the west not so green and potentially harder to see animals because of coloring.  Thanks in advance for the help. ,aedrbf,,West Hartford...

Hello!    My husband and I ended our honeymoon last year in SA. We did 3 nights Ngala 3 nights Sabi Sands 2 nights Mossel Bay 4 nights Cape Town 2 nights Hermanus 2 nights at Last Word Long Beach and 2 nights in Stellenbosch. We moved around a lot but we don't mind that.    Our main purpose this trip was Botswana but we have an extra week before and decided to tack on SA (we were trying to make Maritous or Serychelles work but we are thinking it would just be too rushed).    With that said - I cannot figure out what to do! Our first time around we did so much and loved it! We hiked table mountain lions head had two full day wine tours cape peninsula tour the list goes on....    The main reason we went to Mossel Bay - or the only reason I should say - was at the time the great white sharks were MIA and that was the best chance of seeing them. It has been on my husbands bucket list for years. We unfortunately did not see them but just in the past 2 - 3 weeks have been keeping an eye on sightings and Marine Dynamics in Gansbaii has been seing them ALMOST DAILY! I know its still wuite a ways away until our trip but I figured if we are there its worth planning a night or two there in order to try it if sightings are still higher.    We stayed at Whalesong Lodge in De Kelders and LOVED it but its pretty booked up in November for our dates. Has anyone stayed at to Kleinzee Oceanfront guesthouse ? Or recommend somewhere near Gansbaii? We had an incredible stay at Whalesong Lodge and watched whales breeching from our balcony the entire trip. I was able to book two nights tentatively from Nov 12 - 14 my only reservation is that our flight to Maun Botswana is 1030am on the 14 so we would just have to leave early and I thought staying closer to the airport might be better.    We will land around 4:30pm on November 7th and fly out Nov 14th at 10:30am    I cannot decide how to break up the hotels. I was thinking maybe 4 nights Cape Town 1 night Franschoek 2 nights near Gansbaii if we keep that hotel in De Kelders.    Otherwise maybe 2 nights De Kelders 1 in Franschoek or near SImonstown? and 4 in Cape TOwn?    We did wine tours but did not do the Franshoek Wine Tram I thoguht that would be fun to try but then wed likely need to stay there even with a rental car as we would be drinking.    Also any hotel recomendations would be great. We stayed at Kloof Street Hotel last time and enjoyed it so we could do that again. Otherwise maybe Camps Bay or V&A waterfront. Our only requirements are balcony (preferably with a mountain or water view) under 200USD / night and ideally within walking distance to a gym we can drop in at but that is not a must!    Also - if anoyone has a recomendation for Franshoek or somewhere near Simonstown ? We stayed at CLouds Estate last time!      Thanks so much : ) ,Rachel,,"White Rock, Canada"
Hello Expert Travellers    I am looking for suggestions and advise to best plan our 10 day trip to South Africa. I’ll be accompanied by my wife and 2 boys aged 9 & 13. Our dates of travel will be from 10 Dec 2023 to 21 Dec 2023.    We are keen to explore the wildlife which South Africa is famous for. Apart from that we have been recommended to do Cape Town as well and some have suggested Suncity & George too.    We are very confused about the best game drives to visit and the camps to stay and spend 3 nights and also unsure of other destinations to cover.    We can fly into Johannesburg and fly out of Cape Town. We are travelling from Australia so will be a long journey to get to South Africa and would like the first day to relax and unwind.    We are also open to the idea of self drive if recommended and safe in South Africa.    Please provide inputs to make this a memorable trip for us. Thank you ,Aussiemyte,,"Mulgrave, Australia"
Hi    I am visiting Cape Town as part of a group of 12-15 people. I wondered if anyone had any recommendations of a tour guide/private driver who can help us with a trip around the Cape Peninsula and a hike up table mountain.    I guess we are more interested in a driver than a guide for Cape Peninsula or at least someone I can customise an itinerary with. Aiming for more relaxed visits that feeling rushed.    Any recommendations for either would be most welcome. ,Jonathan R,Cape Town,
I am planning our first trip to South Africa and I'm looking for guidance regarding flights to Cape Town from Sabi Sands Game Reserve. We will be spending 3 nights inside Kruger National Park followed by 2 nights at Idube within Sabie Sand. We would like to then fly directly to Cape Town for another few nights. The only direct flight that I see is from Skukuza airport to Cape Town at 11:40 am on Airlink. In order to make that flight we would need to miss the early morning game drive (we will have a vehicle so we would drive from Idube and return our vehicle at Skukuza). Is there an alternative that I am unaware of? The only other option that I can think of is to spend one night after Idube in KNP so that we can be at the airport early that morning and make the most of our 2 nights at Idube. We are unable to switch the order of our itinerary. Thank you in advance for any recommendations! ,beachnrun,Cape Town,

Hi    I’m after some advice please. After many weeks of researching about a holiday to South Africa next year I have finally booked it. My husband and I are flying to Cape Town arriving from UK on Monday 24th March 2024 and spending 4 nights in Cape Town and then picking up our hire car to drive to Franschhoek and then up the garden route. We are in Cape Town from Monday morning until Friday lunchtime. Had do I make the most of time we have there please. As we won’t have a car I’m not sure if we should book tours? We want to do Table Mountain Boulders Beach to see the penguins Robben Island Chapman’s Peak the Cape of Good Hope Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden.  Are there any mid week markets on in Cape Town?    Is this possible to do all of this? Also which would be the best way to see all of this without a car?

Hi    We are a couple with a kid. We will arrive at JNB airport at 6h10 in the morning in December after a long-haul flight and want to do self drive in Kruger national park.    I don't want to do a 6 hour drive right after the overnight flight and want to use shuttle to transport us to Nelspruit and rent a car there. I find that Limetime has a shuttle departure from the airport at 8h15. Does anyone know whether this company is reliable? Are two hours enough to go through covid screening/immigration check/get the checked the baggage?    Is it safe to walk to the bus terminal with luggage?

Hi all    I have searched and read lots and lots both on here and other sites. We are thinking of coming to Kruger for the 1st 2 weeks of April next year but have seen slightly conflicting information.    Some sites say the best time is from May onwards but then some say from April onwards.    'Best' for us means best for wildlife viewing. I know there can be sudden downpours in April but that doesn't bother us as long it hopefully doesn't rain all day every day!    And if the consensus is that early April is good for wildlife are there particular areas of the park that would be better at this time of year? Or does it not really matter?    Thanks    Emma. ,garstanggirl,Kruger National Park,"England, United..."

We are big fans of Kruger and have spent a lot of time in the national park over 3 visits. We’ve never had a problem and know how to plan our trip.    Our last visit was 4 years ago.. and just when we were about to book our tickets for a 15-day visit in October. We happened to read a few articles on the load shedding issue and how it is expected to go beyond stage 6 in the months to come.    We now need help in deciding whether to go ahead with our plans or not.    All our time will be spent in Kruger at the major call moms (Satara Lower Sabie Olifants and Shingwedzi)    How bad is the load shedding expected to be in October?    Will there be power cuts in the night. We have a 4 year old child with us. We want him to be able to sleep well so that we can get up early and go on drives.    Will cooking meals be a problem during long periods without electricity?    Do major camps have generators?    Too many questions I know but we love Kruger and want to visit. The load shedding situation worries us. ,Ashok N,,

Hi all  Thank you for your previous comments. We have now booked tickets for arrival in Cape Town 9/23 so our first full day will be 9/24. Departing 10/10 from Johannesburg.  Here is the breakdown we are considering:    5 nights/4 days Cape Town  3 nights/4 days Grootbos Nature Reserve  4 nights/3 days Madikwe  5 nights/ 4 days Johannesburg    I could take one night from Grootbos or Madikwe and add it to Johannesburg as we will be there to visit friends and celebrate a 90th birthday.    Hotel questions:  I am traveling with my adult daughter so all hotel and lodge accomodations must provide 2 beds.  Cape Town...waterfront area or Company Gardens area? Budget depends on the hotel as we have Marriott points and American Express points we could use if needed. AMEX points would go to One & Only. Or if there is a very special place for $400 USD or less per night we would consider it. Gorgeous George was mentioned to us as a possibility as well.    Madikwe....so many interestiing lodges! We like the idea of one that is community owned and I have been reading about Buffalo Ridge Impodimo Jaci's Tau Thakadu River Camp and Tuningi. Does it make a different for game viewing which lodge? Some seem to be on water sources while others are not. What are the tented accomodations like at Jaci's lodge? It is difficult to compare because the web sites don't seem to have all the information. Are the lodges in Madikwe individually fenced? I would prefer not fenced. Do any allow you on a conservation ride to work with the animals? And is it worth finding one that offers bush walks? (apparently you must have a Dr. note if over age 60..why?)    Johannesburg....though we will be visiting friends we still will be sightseeing and staying in our own place. Has anyone stayed at the Four Seasons? It is only a 5 minute drive to our friends. How about the Doveton House or French Quarter Johannesburg. I will be connecting with friends for advice as well but they never stay in hotels in their own city :)    Last question...how do we get from Cape Town to Madikwe? And then to Johannesburg? We will not have a car. Is there a link for flight schedules? Do you take a charter? Do the lodges pick you up at the airport?    Thank you for your help. We are very excited to be planning the trip. ,aedrbf,,West Hartford...

Traveling a lot there’s always a question about zero deductible full coverage insurance value and what feels like a rip off.    Speaking from personal experience today when a truck sideswiped our car by moving into our lane on N2 it was an extreme relief first obviously to be able to deal with the police station and Avis office at the Cape Town airport knowing that we did not have to deal with the damages to our vehicle (even if the truck-trailer operator was able to persuade the police that somehow someone else was at fault.) Relief handing over the keys and getting a replacement vehicle and yes losing a day of holiday but having financial peace of mind.    I have a laminated color copy of my passport which came in perfectly handy today that I keep with me when I’m traveling outside of the hotel (and your country’s drivers license and international license.)    This time we paid for both of us to drive which was extremely fortunate as well. We have sometimes just relied on our excellent credit card coverage and not purchased additional driver coverage or super coverage/0 deductible insurance. Based on strong recommendations online and on TripAdvisor I purchased max coverage and I am so glad.    Yes this accident obviously put a dent in our holiday happiness but all in all it could’ve been rather disastrous on many levels. By some crazy measure of good lluck our entire vehicle left side where I was a passenger was hit from the front fender all the way to the back fender skipping my door and the one behind me.    . I know it’s often obnoxious to use all caps. I’m telling you ***BUY ZERO DEDUCTIBLE COVERAGE! *** Forget thinking how great of a driver you may be. People are running lights load shedding has no lights (robots) sometimes people turn in front of you randomly no matter how careful you are. Buy coverage. Cheap money. ,Lana G,,Massachusetts

Hi we'll have 1 full day in CPT itself. We're trying to put together a good general plan for seeing the highlights including nice views and a good sunset. We like to hike but don't want to waste too much time hiking at the expense of other things.    I was thinking we'd hike up to Table Mountain take the cable car down. See various sites in the city. And then take an uber up to Signal Hill for sunset. (Of course all this is weather dependent.)    That would mean skipping Lion's Head. Is Lion's head better than climbing up Table Mountain and seeing the sunset from Signal Hill? The problem with Lions Head is it seems like it'll take us 2 hours up and back whereas the Table Mountain one way hike will take us just an hour. Is hiking down Lions Head in the dark unsafe? Should we take the cable car to Table Mountain so we have time to climb Signal Hill at sunset?    Thanks for the advice! ,LAX_Esq,Cape Town,Los Angeles...
I am soon going to be back in South Africa for a short while. While there I'd like to apply to renew my current passport which expires early next year. Two quick questions. Nr. 1 will I be able to travel internationally on my current (valid) passport while waiting for the new one to arrive? Assuming no special arrangement needs to be made for this and one isn't required to hand in a current passport when applying for a new one i.e. the old one is only cancelled at the point the new one is collected? And Nr. 2 what - for those of you that have recently applied - is the current turnaround time from application to collection? Thanks a lot. ,CellarDoor,,
Hi hive mind .I am the lead passenger entrusted with planning the itinerary for our trip to Cape town in Mid August this year . 11 people youngest is 17 . All fit and active and willing to walk 😄  We have 6.5 days in Cape town and are in a hotel close to centre ( The Rockefeller).  Just wanted a sanity check on this itenerary with any suggestions and improvements in terms of efficiently utilising the days . Anywhere with three ??? Means I am not sure of plan 😔  Zero day or first half day .... day we arrive and reach hotel by 12 noon ..chill and ??? and dinner and bed ( long flight )  1st day .. Saturday ..Robberg island and V and A waterfront ( as the island ferry is from the waterfront area ( don't intend to do aquarium unless it's super duper out of this world as we have seen large aquariums elsewhere ???) .  2nd day ... Hop on hop off tour ( don't normally do this but been recommended it and easy way to get a bearing and see maybe 1 or 2 sights like the beach/ a cathedral etc ???  3rd day .. table mountain after Bo kaap . Intend to use cable car . Afternoon activity ??? District 6 museum ???  4th day ... Full day to Harmanus / Kleiinbai for seeing the whales / marine 5 safari  5th day .. Cape if good hope and Chapman peak full day tour ( either minibus with driver hire or a formal tour company)  6th day .. lions head in morning and Stellenbosch half day after ??? ( Many of our party donot drink alcohol and those that do are predominantly whisky lovers ) .. can take Ubers or hire the minibus for half day .... Suggestions for what specific place in stellenbosch that we should aim for  if we just see a winery or two and not actually do any wine tastings ?( No point doing the train/ tram if we are not going to drink at the wineries ?)    Have I missed any must see or must do things please ?    We don't want to drive .  We don't want to do any safari nearby as going to Kruger after this .  We thought about and took out the garden route from our SA itenerary as we are doing Victoria falls and Kruger as well in this trip and can't fit everything in within the number of days available.. we can come back and do the garden route another time .... We will take the scenic route to Harmanus as a small consolation .      Any suggestions gratefully received . ,anand a,Cape Town,
Hi  We are a family of 4 traveling to South Africa at end of June. We are in Capetown then onto 2 lodges for safari.  Questions: there seems to be serious luggage limitations and was wondering what other families recommend for luggage.    And I have heard morning drives are cold and dress in layers etc. saying that are we supposed to bring heavy winter coats or is light jacket ok? ,NYC1240,,New York
My family (2 adults 1 child) will be arriving at OR Tambo airport at 6:30pm in February. We'll be self-driving to Madikwe Reserve the following day... is it recommended to stay at the airport the first night (it's a flight from the US so the awkward arrival time can't be helped) & pick up our rental car the next day - or get the rental and drive somewhere else to spend the night? Not sure where to start with this one. Thanks in advance! ,GooseNYC,Johannesburg,New York

I am headed to SA in July with 2 friends and we have our trip pretty well sorted until the Kruger part where I have been totally overwhelmed not to mention planning too late for full availability and options.    I've seen several tour packages that include a night or two in Balule Reserve - how does this compare to other reserves and the park itself?    We are simultaneously cobbling together stays in SANPARKS rest camps but unclear how good the park game drives are and if it's possible to hire private guides to leave from any of the rest camps for day trips assuming we want to add to the mix of self-driving and parks-led drives.    Basically looking for any advice on how to get the most out of a 7 day trip to Kruger for folks that are unable to splash out and need to stay more in the $200-$300 a day range. ,KATrotta,Kruger National Park,Washington DC...
Does anyone know whether there are still white shark breaching tours around Capetown/Gansbaai/Mossek Bay?    We contacted several companies however it appears breaching tours have ceased from the replies so far. We will still likely go for a cage dive tour but was hoping for a breaching tour for more ideal photo ops.    Cheers  Adrian ,Adrian_C1981,,"Singapore, Singapore"
HI - we booked Cape town for this coming January - we land (jet lagged) Sat evening on the 20th - we leave from C T following Saturday - have 6 full days - we were going to simply do C T and Vineyards not having heard of garden route!

Love scenery and nature - any and all ideas welcomed and considered. Thanks ,okemabeach,Garden Route,"Saskatoon, Canada"
We are staying in Knysna for 3 nights in December en route back to Cape Town after visiting a Game Lodge. (We will already have been in Cape Town in the wine region for a wedding and overnight in Plettenberg Bay.)

We're considering places like Wilderness Hermanus Mossel Bay Oudsthoorn Swellendam and we're not sure which would be best to try to make the most of our trip along the Garden Route. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thank you. ,teba2020,Garden Route,"Reading, United..."

We are arriving in early July and going straight to Stellenbosch for our first few nights in SA. Given the 24+ hours of travel I think we'll get a ride to our hotel then rent a car the following day rather than rent and drive from CT. My question is: the hotel quoted me R650 for airport transfer for two people -- that seems expensive compared to what I've read of taxi/uber rates from the airport to Stellenbosch but maybe my info is outdated. Is that a reasonable price? If that's the ballpark it's fine. Sometimes it's worth it to pay a bit more for simplicity and ease. But if it's significantly more then we may want to rethink it.  Thanks! ,NBPT_traveler,Cape Town,Newburyport

Hi. We have been looking to do Cape Town and garden route independently February 2024. car hire included. After looking on UK foreign office travel advisory along with French US and Australian offices as well as recent websites. These are stating you should exercise high level of caution even at airports. With level being heightened to level 2.  Advised not to go anywhere at night unless by taxi. Even daytime not safe as couple. Tourists being targeted everywhere as crime increases.  Our previous holidays even in US etc have never carried this level of caution.  I am looking for reviews from people who have very recently travelled independently and included car hire as we do not want to be looking over our shoulder whole holiday. We love walking as well as at night and like to feel free to drive at night to views of city etc. We are Not tour people. Neither are we youngster's or backpackers.  Honest advice please as we are not happy to book at moment on information perused ,Carole Heath,Cape Town,

Hey all.    it's been a few years since I was last in Kruger and of course the loadshedding has become much much worse since then. Are the camps (I'm thinking mainly Berg-en-Dal and Skukuza) affected by loadshedding?    I'm asking because I may need to recharge a few electronics like phone camera batteries etc overnight.

Hi we'll have 2 nights in Capetown in June. Landing at 4:20pm on a Monday and flying out at 7:40pm on a Wednesday. Curious to get some help/advice on planning what to do.    Seems like we should do one day in the city and one day outside the city. For the day outside the city we hate organized tours and it seems like a hassle to have to rent a car for one day; so I think hiring a driver for the day is what we'll have to do. (What's the going rate for a private driver for the day? Can taxis be taken from place to place?) Would it better to do Tuesday in the city and then Wednesday with a private driver and have him take us to the airport directly?    Thanks very much! ,LAX_Esq,Cape Town,Los Angeles...

Hi    We are planning a trip to SA in May and we would like to fly to Durban rent a car go diving in Sodwana bay visit Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and then make our way up to Kruger National Park and Sabi Sands (Umkumbe) before flying out of Johannesburg.    Is it reasonable to drive from HiM to Kruger in one day? If yes which route is the fastest?  And is there anything that needs to be considered regarding crossing eSwatini?  Visa shouldn't be an issue (we are from Italy and France) but I'm more concerned about road conditions traffic driving after sunset etc.    We are planning to spend 3 nights in Kruger from May 11th to May 14.  We haven't booked the campsites yet but I saw availability for the first night in Crocodile Bridge and Skukuza so we have some flexibility regarding the entry gate.  We could also consider spending the first night just outside KNP if the drive is too long to make it before the gate closes.    The alternative would be to drive back to Durban fly to Kruger Mpumalanga International via Johannesburg and rent a second car there but it doesn't seem like it would save us so much time.    Thank you very much for your help!  Enrico ,Enrico D,Kruger National Park,"Milan, Italy"

Hi everyone. We are planning our trip to SA in August this year and I've been researching wine tours and came across the wine tram which looks like loads of fun and definitely something I'd rather do than an arranged tour I think.    Will be me and husband wine tasting but will have 2 teens with us (boys 16 and 13) so they might like the tram experience but will be bored at the tasting bits (I've read there is wifi in places so that might placate them). We will need to feed them a lot so any recommendations for lunch/ snack places?    Also which is the best line to take or should we look into each winery and decide based on what takes our fancy? I am a white wine drinker and husband is red and we are certainly not connoisseurs - I like mine cold and dry and husband likes a fruity merlot or cab sauv. I also like rose and sparkling.    We are staying at V&A in Cape Town so is the best way to get to and from the wine train booking a transfer/ chauffeur with them or I've seen that the city pass does a trip including the tram tickets too (only navy/ burgundy line which says not available until 14 August on tram website which is curious). Dates are either 7 or 8 August. ,lc2blt,,"Leeds, United..."

Hi South Africa forum  Thanks so much for your help with our trip in Feb. We had a fabulous time in St Lucia ( despite monsoonal rain!) and at Rhino River Lodge.  We have an amazing opportunity to come again from 28th May for a week and we’re struggling to find a lodge.  Plan probably is to drive from Durban to St Lucia for 3 days to do what we couldn’t in Feb due rain ( Cape Vidal etc) and then we’d love to do 2 - 3 nights on Safari. Does anybody have any recommendations please? We looked at Rgink Sanda but there are 2 adults and a 14 year old so they can’t accomodate us. We’ve found availability at Lions Valley in Nambiti but a bit over our budget and at Speingbok Game Lodge which I don’t think looks like what we’re after! Are we being too fussy?!  Does anybody have any other suggestions please ideally for a smallish camp catered and not self drive.  Thanks  Nic ,bruisyard,,United Kingdom

Hello everyone    I've sketched out an itinerary for a trip which would be our first (and possibly last) trip to Africa. Nothing complicated:  - fly to Cape Town spend 3 nights  - fly to Hoedspruit get a car spend 2 nights in and around Panorama Route  - drive to a private Kruger lodge eg Elephant Plains for 2 nights  - drive to another lodge eg Geigers Camp for 2 nights  - drive to Hoedspruit fly to JNB and then back home    Now there is always scope for tweaking an itinerary like that and comments are very welcome but my main question is this: what would be the best time of year for this trip? My current guess is September but would really like to know what the trade-offs might be and what people think.    Thanks! ,Loddonlily,,Great Malvern...
Hello  I am just starting to look at a SA safari and starting my planning. It is quite overwhelming because everywhere I look i want to go. So wanted to run an itinerary by the forum. Will also post on the Botswana forum so you may see this again.    First here are some details:  * It is my husband and I traveling. We are in our early and mid 60s. Healthy and active.  * Looking at June 2024.  * We do not need over the top glam luxury but maybe lower end luxury if that exists? I would like to experience some of the cool camps I see in some of the pictures if I can make it work.  * Would love to combine maybe a lodge with a tent experience  * Want smaller properties with excellent guides/trackers. 6 max to a vehicle  * If possible not places that cater specifically to young families.  * Want to see everything of course but Elephants lions leopards and giraffes are up there in my would love to see list. And of course if get lucky a cheetah and rhino.    That said here is what I am thinking as far as itinerary. I have no idea of the travel between and if what I am planning is too far and difficult. Just trying to get some feedback before I start reaching out to agencies.  * Cape Town - 3nights  * Kruger - private reserve - 3 nights  * Botswana Okavango Delta 3 nights; or Zambia lower Zambezi 3 nights or Zimbabwe Hwange 3 nights  * 2 nights VF  * Home - To Dallas TX    I hear game viewing in Kruger is better (true?) but Botswana has a more remote experience. Remote with great wildlife is what we hope to find.  If this is too much would you suggest just two places in Botswana and skip Kruger?  Or skip VF altogether (I know that is probably a personal choice).  And last question (for now at least) if we did just skip Kruger area altogether is Zambia on the same level of wildlife experience/sightings as Botswana? Lodges seem a little less expensive there but I would rather spend a little more to have a better experience as far as animals. Also while I don't mind a walking safari do not want all to be walking. Maybe one or two.  I hope I have given enough information on myself and our wish list and have been clear enough in my questions. Sorry ahead of time if I've missed some important information to allow for you to provide feedback.  OH... We can't add on more time for work with the time to travel r/t and of course costs.  So appreciate any help or thoughts you can give on the above. If you have any special lodges you love per the above that would be additional help so thank you! Or any recommended local agencies that are not tied to specific lodges. Thanks SO much!!! It all looks so amazing that I can't zero in on anything so appreciate your help! ,txtvler,Kruger National Park,"Dallas, Texas"
My wife and I are visiting South Africa in December from the UK and would really appreciate some advice on certain things.  Currrently we are planning on spending 5 days Cape Town 2 days Franschhoek then fly to Skukuza where we plan to spend 5-6 nights on safari and 2 nights at Timamoon before flying back to the UK. We have researched safaris significantly and are pretty sure we'd like to visit Sabi Sands with Ulusaba looking great for our budget over 5 days however reading this forum it seems we'd have a better / more varied experience if we visited 2 visit two different places (3 days at each perhaps)? It'd be great to hear others thoughts. Ulusaba hooked us in a bit with there stay 4 days and get one free that made it more affordable. We can spend up to £5k / 115k rand on the safari part.    Also a friend said she wouldn't bother going on safari in SA in December due to bush growth and we'd be unlikely to see anything! Is this the case? ,Sheryl and Luke S,,

I’ll be travelling (male late 30s) with my daughter (7 years old) to Camps Bay in March next year staying at Tree Tops Apartment (just 160m from Victoria road up Geneva Drive).    Ideally I’d hope to be able to walk back from restaurants in the evening (probably around 9/9.30pm).

Then I take my luggage out again and fly to Windhoek with Air Namibia on another PNR. The time difference is only 5.5 hours.    Do I need to leave the airport for this? Anyone knows if I can manage this without a SA visa?    Will appreciate the replies! Thanks ,NomadicTyrant,Johannesburg,"Mumbai, India"

We will be catching a flight from P. E. To Johannesburg and I was hoping someone could confirm the travel time from Oceana resort to P.E. for me. Google maps says approx 2 hours but a few people have advised that sometimes their timings can be way off.  As we MUST catch our flight I want to make sure we give ourselves enough time to get there and drop the car off.  Any advice would be most welcome! ,Alison Denison,Port Elizabeth,
We are thinking of going to South Africa for a fortnight from 9th June to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary.  Is June the wrong time of year to go? I am aware it is winter but still want to be able to experience things such as Table mountain Robben Island garden route whale watching in Hermanus without everything being cancelled due to the weather.  Also do we need a car in Cape Town or are we better off picking it up as we leave? Is a self drive to cape point/peninsular or a tour better/recommended?  Thank you in advance for any advice you can give ,Nursie11,,"Nottingham, United..."
So I know there is a custom to tip in SA and that's fine I just want to make sure I give enough for different services so hoping you can help me sense check/ amend my thoughts as needed. Will be 4 of us on trip; me husband and 2 teenage boys. We've booked a lot of what we're doing as a package so don't know the individual cost of things.    Restaurants / meals and bars: 10-15% of total bill  Chauffeur/ transfers: R20?  Gas station attendants: R10-20  Car guards: R10-20  Housekeeping at hotels: R50 per night?  Porters / help with bags: R10 per bag?    The safari element is where I get confused. Happy to leave a per night amount for all staff R250 per night? But then I've read about drivers and guides and tipping separately. How much for these and do I do it after each game drive (we'll be doing 2 a day I think a total of about 7).    What about other trips - do we tip the wine tram/ bus drivers? We also might be going shark diving do we tip the boat crew?    I think that's all but anyone else I've missed please do say. Thank you. ,lc2blt,,"Leeds, United..."

On my 6 weeks trip in Cape Town and the Garden Route in November / December 2022 I experienced load shedding from stage 3 to 6 (out of max. stage 8). Stage 6 means up to 7.5 hours without power at daytime ! Loadshedding times are changing almost every day and sometimes within an hour. To get current information about the times without power I used the App ESP (EskomSePush Loadshedding). I thought as a tourist backpacker loadshedding wouldn't be a big problem but found it quite annoying. Depending on your (backpacker) accomodation you have no light or can't cook. Once I had no running water for 4 hours because they had an electric water pump. Not so nice if you come back sweaty from a walk. I used a MTN SIM Card and e.g. in Wilderness there was no internet during loadshedding because MTN seem to have no backup power there. If shops have no generators they close during loadshedding same for ATM's. Not really a great problem for tourists compared to the problems people in South Africa and the economy have but probably good to know before you go. ,Engl E,,
Can anyone suggest a good alternative to “Beat about the Bush” mammals by Trevor Carnaby.  I would like to buy a book to take with me to Kruger and Namibia later this year. Reading the reviews I came across “Beat about the bush” this seemed a good mix of info and photos regarding animal behaviour without having to wade through lots of text. Unfortunately it seems this book is no longer available. Can anyone suggest an alternative? I looked at “The safari companion” but I feel this is perhaps not a pick up and dip into while on safari type of read.  We will be stopping off a Woolworths Crossing in Nelspruit for groceries before Kruger. Are there any bookshops in that area?  Any advice is welcome  Regards Tracy ,Tracy,Kruger National Park,"Breda, The..."

Hello TA – would appreciate any feedback on my planned itinerary in Cape Town. Solo traveller F55. Staying at Derwent House in the Gardens area prior to doing a tour that covers Garden Route Johannesburg and Kruger. Love photography street art culture. Not a foodie but enjoy a good meal and a drink. Arriving mid Sept. Plan at this stage is    Day One: Cape of Good Hope Tour (looking at Cape Archives tours) – it includes a stop at Bo Kaap before starting down the Cape    Day Two: Franschhoek and Stellenbosch Wine Tour – don’t want a private tour but any recommendations for a small group tour would be appreciated    Day Three (Sat): Oranjezicht Markets in the AM and the 1pm Robben Island tour and an early dinner at the V&A Waterfront – or do the Markets and Waterfront during the day and do the 3pm Robben Island tour    Day Four: Table Mountain Aerial Cableway and Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. Maybe get the HOHO ticket this day to help with moving around    Any input appreciated ie: things I’ve missed moving things around that work better together etc. TIA ,bd1209,Cape Town,"Jannali, Australia"

This is not a question but simple advice.    If you're an Indian citizen hoping to travel to South Africa through their new eVisa then don't bother. The eVisa portal does not work and you're MUCH better off applying manually through the VFS/High Commission setup.    Here's what happened with me.    I set up an account on the eVisa portal and filled up the application form. This part wasn't difficult just lengthy and prone to frequent system timeouts. Next I was asked to upload documents of which 7-8 were deemed 'necessary' and the rest were 'optional' (although the notations next to them mistakenly said 'required'). This part was also done quite easily.    Ideally after the submission of documents the website should have asked me to pay the visa fee. The application would have been considered completed after this and be taken up by the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa for deliberation.    Nothing of this sort happened. The payment sub-section kept on showing 'not available' for a good week. I also tried creating duplicate applications which were voided on the spot since my original application was still 'active' (with no option to void it). I tried emailing calling and tweeting to the DHA but of course nothing came out of it.    Irritated I used the weekend to gather all my documents and headed over to the VFS application centre in my city yesterday (these details are all on the VFS website). No appointment was needed the staff ran me through the checklist patiently and I was able to submit my application in person in 5 minutes even if I paid a little extra than what the eVisa system would've offered me. They also told me emphatically that the eVisa system is a total failure and never worked for even a single moment. The High Commission meanwhile has been doing a fantastic job of processing applications in 2-3 days as opposed to the official timeline of 5 working days.    I'm hoping to have my visa in hand before the end of the week but in the meantime if anyone here is considering applying for the South Africa eVisa do yourself a favour and DON'T. ,prayashgiria,,"New Delhi, India"

We will be arriving in Cape Town late September 23 and departing from Johannesburg October 10. We are considering 5 full days in Cape Town touring the city and vacinity. Then we could head to Grootbos for 2-3 nights or fly to Victoria Falls. Then head to Madikwe for safari staying 3-4 nights. Our final nights will be in Johannesburg visiting friends. The question is should we head to Victoria Falls or head to Grootbos. The falls should be beautiful but Grootbos seems so different. Opinions? And yes we are trying to choose a malaria free safari.

In July 2023 our family of 4 including 2 teenagers arrive at Johannesburg airport at 10.15 am before travelling to Namibia the next day at 10.40am.    We are quite interested time permitting to see a bit of Johannesburg in the afternoon of our arrival day ( we will need to rest in the Morning after a long flight).  One place of interest to visit is the Apartheid museum. A tour of Soweto is also of interest but I do not think that we will have enough time to visit both places.    Bearing in mind the distances and the need to be at the airport 3 hours prior to our 10.40 flight the next day  should we stay at a hotel near the airport or at a hotel in Sandton?    The Sandton sun hotel sounds good as it is in a mall with many eating places nearby.    Also between the Sandton Sun and the Radisson Blu  which is a better hotel?    Any other hotel suggestions will be useful.    Thanking you in advance . ,AshCroydon,Johannesburg,"London, United..."

What is the ecoli situation like there?Is the water clear now?Is surfing allowed to continue?  Regards  Byron ,Byron B,KwaZulu-Natal,
Dear Tripadvisors    After some hesitations and doubts about the safety in South Africa and reading on the situation a month ago we decided to visit South Africa for the first time and we have booked our tickets back then.    We will arrive at Cape Town on the 6th of May and fly out from Cape Town on the 27th of May.  Our initial plan was to start driving from Cape Town the day after our arrival.  Planning is Cape Town --> Swartberg Pass --> Kleine Karoo --> Addo Elephant N.P. --> Garden Route --> Cape Town for 6 days and finish with 3 days Stellenbosch.    As i have downloaded the ESKOM ESP app and monitor the updates and stages of loadshedding since a month its getting me more worried every single day.  When we booked the trip it was primarily between stage 2 and 3 now its mainly at 6 and word is that in reality they are in 7 or 8 allready given the fact that energy reduction is far beyond that of stage 6.    The following questions preferably by South African people or people who visited last weeks.    - Will the loadshedding affect our holiday a lot? We can work around minor blackout periods.  - Will there be additional safety hazards any other than the usual one for South Africa?    And then my main concern:  I have read in South African media that professionals warn on a possible Grid Collapse. That would mean that the whole of South Africa would be without ANY electricity for 6 to 14 days in the best case.  What would this mean for our safety? Can we expect roadblocks lootings intense criminality and possible 'civil war' scenarios?    Somebody here to clear my view on this subject?    By the way: We are not a scared couple. We have done self-drive roadtrips in Mexico for example. But: My girlfriend is pregnant now and we both dont feel the apetitie to be stuck in a nation on the brinks of collapse when the electricity is down for lets say 10 days and there is major civil unrest outside.    Thanks for any honest feedback! ,FlorianBakker,,

We have 8 days total so I thought we could de Table Mountain Bo Kaap Seal Island Boulders Beach drive through Chapman's peak... maybe that in 2 days?

Next day Knysha for the elephants not sure if we should stay there or somewhere else. Then I Don't know what else to do... go to PE? Or back to Johannesburg and see Sun City?

A large family room would be excellent... Is that even possible?? I keep getting quotes for over $10000 for 3 nights that is way over our budget. ,Summercyn,,

Hello everyone  I'm planning a trip to visit Kruger National Park In 2024 and I've been running into trouble finding a suitable car hire company or car hire excess insurance. I know this topic has come up before but I haven't found a recent discussion . So are there car rental companies that will cover you for the dirt roads of Kruger park. I've found safari vehicles that are covered but no suvs for instance. I'm also having trouble finding car hire excess insurance..Questar and Worldwide were a dead end and other companies claim they could cover the vehicle unless it went against the car hire companies policy. unfortunately the care hire policy seems to be that the insurance is void if I drive on the dirt roads of Kruger.Anyway I would appreciate some current information. Thank you everyone. This is always a great place for information ,Frank R,Kruger National Park,

Just landed back this morning after 23 days in South Africa and visit number 26 already planning another trip in November  The Cape was busy when I landed and by all accounts they have had a great season with high tourist numbers  Lots of new restaurants and bars to try out! Stellenbosch has transformed it’s become so vibey with lots of new restaurants and bars tables on the street. I loved it!  Uber worked well never waited more than 5 minutes  New restaurant spots I enjoyed were Post and Pepper De Eetkamer Rynarts  Cavalli was also excellent although I went on a very rainy evening so there were no views  Salt at Waterford also excellent and it’s always beautiful to sit in their courtyard  Chorus at Waterkloof also very good - modern with an Afrikaans twist  Wineries I particularly enjoyed - and I visited many!  Kleinood Oldenburg Stark Conde Delaire in Stellenbosch  Atlas Swift and Leeu Estates in Franschhoek  And the little tasting room at Painted Wolf at Simondium with a pizza from next door is highly recommended  Silverthorn in Bonnievale was also superb if you like fizz  In the Hemel en Aarde I enjoyed Newton Johnson Creation Hasher and a wonderful private tasting with Restless River  The only disappointment was Benguela Cove very fancy stunning tasting room overlooking the Bot River lagoon but the service was very poor  I was also slightly disappointed with my lunch at Farro at Gabriel  I tried a couple of new restaurants in Cape Town. Chefs Warehouse has just reopened at the Bailey on Breë Street  Ouzeri is a Greek Cypriot restaurant on Wale Street great small plates and an excellent wine list  I had a wonderful 6 nights at Senalala in the Klaserie. I often read that people have poor sightings in the Klaserie which has never been the case for me. I saw lions leopards wild dogs a huge herd of buffalo elephants galore! A very small baby hippo and a black mamba eating a baby scrub hare. The birds were abundant as always  Now to the dreaded load shedding which went to stage 6 yesterday which makes it very inconvenient  Everywhere I stayed the wifi stayed on. Then it ranged from one live plug to everything but the air con working in my Stellenbosch and I think most lodges now have generators  I did mention to different guesthouses that they should note that they have things working during loadshedding  Some restaurants do have a slightly restricted menu some shops are plunged into darkness including Melrose Arch in Joburg yesterday. But my main concern was the safety. The streets are very dark and the traffic lights going out is a huge issue. It was like wacky races in Joburg yesterday and quite stressful. The same on the N2 in Somerset West where some (not all) the lights go out  I did find it a pain sometimes like planning when to dry my hair and getting up early so I could have a coffee it it was going off first thing. Definitely worth downloading Eskom Push  But apart from that everything was just as I remembered and it was great to see all the friends I’ve made over the years again ,lisasplaces,,"Leeds, United..."
We’ll have two nights /one day in Johannesburg early next month before heading off on a 3-week road-trip. We’ve visited the city twice before but loadshedding wasn’t much of an issue back then. We’ll be staying at the Intercontinental at the airport so would just plan to get over our long flight by spending some time around the Rosebank/Sandton malls on our ‘free’ day. To avoid unwelcome surprises we’d really appreciate a little current local advice on:    Gautrain: is the service itself ever affect by loadshedding or can we be confident of getting to/from the airport pretty much when we expect? Do the ticket machines always keep working as normal (we have Gautrain cards to re-charge)?    Gautrain stations: do the escalators/lifts/lights always still work regardless of loadshedding or is this potential issue?    OR Tambo: similarly is the airport affected by loadshedding? Not so much the flight-systems more the passenger facilities/services in the terminals?    Car rental at OR Tambo: my recollection is that the car-rental parking building at OR Tambo was always pretty ill-lit at the best of times. Could loadshedding make that even worse – and in particular make it hard to check over a vehicle (I really would like to be sure that the tyres are ok and that the spare exists….)? Or are car-rental services part of any load-shedding exemption that the airport may enjoy?    Lifts in hotels/offices/car-parks: given loadshedding are people wary of using lifts in buildings close to the scheduled power-cut times? Or does everyone just assume/hope that generators will kick in quickly and automatically?    Apologies for the probably-naive questions and many thanks in advance. ,cw10,Johannesburg,London
33 M Indian here. I am eligible for the eVisa but remember reading about it not being functional and leading to delays till atleast New Year's. Wondering if the situation has changed now? I've filled out the form mostly and while there are a few glitches it doesn't seem as challenging (but very labourious).    Also is 17-28 May 2023 a good time to visit? I'll be travelling solo and intend to focus only on Kruger National Park (with a side tour to Panorama Route) and the Cape Town region (don't want to cram too much in I'd rather explore the two places reasonably well). My flights will be in and out of Johannesburg most likely so I'll probably catch a bit of sightseeing there as well.    Already aware about safety issues in the country so will try to stick to guided tours wherever sensible. ,prayashgiria,,"New Delhi, India"

Hi  After safari we flight to Cape Town.  When we need be in airport prior to flight? ,AlexTeTraveler,,Kiryat Motzkin...
Hey all  hope you're doing fine!    I just checked the forum and there are already a lot of posts in the same domain but maybe it is possible to summarize it once again for a better overview.    My girlfriend and I are planning to do a 3-4 weeks South Africa tour - and we want to close that holiday at Kruger. Since we might also want to book the way back to Germany from Kruger via one booking (so probably three flights) the most important question upfront is which Target Airport to consider (Nespruit?).    From what I've read I guess we would prefer private game reserves there because.  - Maybe more private  - Less cars bypassing / crowds  But of course we are also happy to be convinced differently.    Boundary conditions:  2 Persons  4-5 Nights  Budget max. 600€ per night (for both)  All inclusive/Meals included  Included Game drives & walks  Mid November    We are kind of overwhelmed by the different game reserves. What I could conclude so far is the following (exaggerated of course it always depends):  - Sabi Sands: Best for leopards but already quite some vehicles on the road - not as wild as others. Also I guess all the affordable accommodations are already booked.  - Timbavati: Similar to the Sabi Sands but maybe less crowded and more affordable?  - Klaserie: Different landscape known for its beautiful river (We like to think of a nice clean and comfy but laidback accommodation next to the river drinking wine and scouting ;D )    Reading all the posts I get to the two following conclusions:  - Two different game reserves (3 nights 2 nights). One more affordable and the last one more luxurious. But then again the main question arises: How to get from one to the other? In general we would like to have a pickup service from the airport (but which one is the best suited for this plan?) and also a bring-back service to the airport.  - One lodge - maybe Klaserie or Timbavati.      Is there anything that you could recommend or highlight or correct?  We would be very thankful! ,Bennyyy27,Kruger National Park,
I'm currently planning a trip to Kruger. It will be my third time visiting the park having visited twice before in July.    This year I have the option of July or October with October being a bit easier to plan (and a bit cheaper). I know there are no bad months for Kruger but I wonder if things might seem a bit too parched in October. My priority is photography so nice backgrounds are desirable.    I also plan to visit the north of the park this time (furthest north I've been before is Letaba). I'll stay in Shingwedzi for a couple of nights and explore around there a bit. The main appeal of the north is to see the changing landscape - is this pointless in October when all the vegetation will be so dry?    Just curious to get everyone's thoughts. I know I'll have a great time either way but you know what it's like planning precious vacation time.    Thanks! ,Kaamy,Kruger National Park,"Kirkcaldy, United..."
Original itinerary was posted last week for a last minute trip to Cape Town Kruger and Garden Route for 3 adults - dad in 80s and son in 20s. Based on comments we've tweaked itinerary and are again looking for help to ensure this trip will be as great as if we'd been planning it for months! Mid-range accommodation recommendations welcomed.    We are considering:  - after Kruger safari - driving to Joberg instead of flying to get to PLZ to start garden route - CPT  - My son wants to do Panorama Route and Canyon so trying to figure out how best to do this  - Private game reserves have limited availability and are expensive; new idea is to do 4 days in Kruger self drive and secure morning and sunset outings where possible where we stay  Any help would be appreciated!

See penguins  Continue driving and get into the Cape of Good Hope / Cape Point National park  On the way out consider making a coffee stop at the Ostrich farm very close to the turn-off for the National park gate.  The roadside curio shops along this road are a great spot to buy your salad bowls and chess tables  Start the drive back towards Cape Town but this time via Kalk Bay a beautiful fishing village.  See if you have the time to go into its old harbour for the sunset and to see seals up close.  Walk the active little main street in this town.

Our first time looking at safaris and the information is vast! We are a family of 5 (kids aged 16 15 and 10) and looking to fly to Johannesburg then getting a connecting flight to SKU. We are looking at private reserves as this will be a holiday if a lifetime but unsure where to start. We are looking last week of July 2024. Any recommendations? I have a budget of about £4500 for the safari for 4-5 nights. If this is not doable how much would I be looking at for medium luxury? ,Jo,,
We have 9 days. I want to drive the Garden tour and wineries. After much research the trip from Capetown to Mossel Bay seems less interesting than Route 62 which was highly praised. Unless we would drive through the coastal towns which we will not have time to do. This is my itinerary and would love some input. And we are going to other parts of Africa for safaris so unless there is a must-do game reserve that we won't see in Kenya Botswana Namibia Uganda we can skip this. Unless it's highly recommended. We love hiking eating great and interesting foods small towns bed and breakfast beautiful scenery hanging out by the beach surfs. Less touristy items no surfing or bungee jumping and not big industrial cities.    Aug 21: Fly from Capetown to George. Stay in Knysna for 3 nights- hiking Albertinia George  Aug 22: Activities in the area - Gin in Knysa hiking  Aug 23 - Tkitskiamma parkStormsrivier Plettenberg  Aug 24 - Knysna to Oudshoorn (2 nights)  Aug 25 - Calizdorp Cango Caves Ostrick Farm hiking  Aug 26- Oudtshoorn to Swellendam (1 night) Sightseeing/lunch/hiking on the way in Barrydale Montagu  Aug 27 - Swellendam to Franschhoek (2 -3 nights)  Aug 28-29 - wine tasting hiking in surrounding area  Aug 30-Aug 31 Sept 1 - Back to Capetown for 3 days (Hermanus local) ,Donna,Garden Route,Los Altos Hills...

Hello    We are planning our honeymoon for beginning of August in South Africa. We are hoping to start in Cape Town and Hermanus followed by Kruger National Park (Bundox Safari is who we are thinking of staying with after our friends has stayed there) and then we are finishing off in Zanzibar.    We are unsure whether to drive via the Garden Route to make our way towards Kruger or to fly it. We are flexible on the amount of time we spend in SA but so far are thinking 3-4 days in Cape Town / Heranus and 6 days in Greater Kruger. We would need to allocate time for the garden route if we decide to go for it but couldn't allocate more than 3 days really - is this possible?    Could we do the garden route in 3-4 days?  -Oudtshoorn looks great for the congo caves and ostriches  -I'd love to see some elephants close up (having been to Kenya and Ghaha - I refused to support inhuman captivity so I didn't see any) however I have heard that there are some nice sanctuaries along the garden route  -We are allowing time in Cape Town / Heranus for shark diving / boulders beach / table mountain etc...  - Bloukrans Bridge bungee jumping also looks fun    Help advice / a suggested route would be so helpful! As we are having a short engagement (after 14 years together) we don't have much time to plan this honeymoon.    Thank you! ,Jess B,,

Hi - thinking of doing the Panorama route in July. Just wondered how easy the drive is? Are there a lot of nerve jangling mountain passes with sheer drops at the edge of the road or does it feel pretty safe?

Hi All  We are a family of 5 2 adults three kids (15 yr 12 yr 9yr) all active and good day and o/n hikers.  This is our first south Africa trip. This will be in August  self driving.  We want a bit of Safari (Kruger and Imfolozi) a bit of small town atmosphere (St. Lucia) and a bit of hiking and outdoor (Central Drakensberg).    We land in Johannesburg then are travelling through the panorama route (1 night) to Skukuza camp in Kruger for 3 nights. Then we'll head south for the next 9 nights to KZN. The first part is already booked and had many other constraints. I would have wanted a bit more.    This is the itinerary I thought for KZN:    Day 1 leave Skukuza camp down south enter Eswatini and sleep around Matsapha. I'm still wondering if it is worth entering Eswatini or should we pass it and sleep around Amstrerdam/Piet Retief?    Day 2 continue south and arrive at St. Lucia. for three nights.  Still don't have exact schedule will be happy to get some suggestions.    Day 3 St. Lucia    Day 4 St. Lucia    Day 5 move to Mpali camp - for two nights    Day 6 Mpali camp    Day 7 - check out and long drive towards Drakensberg. Arrive at Giant Castle resort.    Day 8 - move for two nights to Cathkin Park/Monks Cowl - hiking and resort style for some R&R before heading back    Day 9 drive to Johann for last night near airport  11am next day flight out.    So my doubts:  Q1: Eswatini vs. drive around vs. all day drive.  Q2: is three nights St. Lucia too much?  Q3: Drive from Mpali camp to Giant castle in one day? or should we stop somewhere and skip Giant castle and next day go toward Cathkin Park/Monk's Cowl for two nights. That will be a pity since it will shorten our Drakensberg part to only two nights.    Thanks!  A.D. ,A.D.,KwaZulu-Natal,San Diego...

Hi all    My fiancé and I are getting married next year and want to start planning our honeymoon for November 2024. It has been a dream to visit South Africa and the thought of spending our honeymoon there really excites me! However I am feeling slightly overwhelmed and do not know where to start! We know we want to do safari in Kruger and also visit Cape Town the winelands and also the garden route but I am unsure what route is best to take. For example is it better to fly to JNB and do the first few days at Kruger and then fly down to CT in which we will fly out of when travelling home?    Is it safe to drive the garden route without a tour? Do you recommend staying over in the wine regions rather than doing day trips?    Suggestions are very much welcome :) ,Emma,,"Edinburgh, United..."

Hello everyone    I am currently in the booking process of spending a few days in Cape Town this November. Since I am traveling alone I have opted to stay at one of the city’s many hostels. I have narrowed it down to either Zebra Crossing in City Bowl or Atlantic Point Backpackers in Green Point. Atlantic Point is located between Main Road and High Level Road. Zebra Crossing is located along Buitengragt Street.    Both hostels seem nice. If you swear by one of these go ahead and share your opinion. However what I am most interested in is the area around these places. Within walking distance how are these local areas compared for pedestrian safety things to do restaurant options (preferably local ones rather than chain brands) social gatherings pubs and transportation availability?    Thanks Everyone! ,Zack F,Cape Town,"Malibu, California"

I’d like to visit the Surrender Hill site (July 1900 Anglo-Boer War) while I’m in Clarens next month. But I’m not sure if access is easy or even possible. To my amateur eye Google Maps may have the location in the wrong place on the south side of the R711 – whereas there appears to be a parking area linked to the site on the north side of the R711 instead. Presumably the site itself – and its commemorative plaque – is somewhere above/beyond the parking area. But I’ve no idea if there’s a trail to the site or if it’s a long/steep walk or if it’s very isolated or if it's on private land which the public can’t access.    If anyone can advise I’d be very grateful. ,cw10,Free State,London

Does anyone have any recent experience of these roads? I realise that I may need to be prepared for potholes but it would be great to know if this is likely to be a long and/or difficult drive.

Hello CPT Community    We are planning on coming back to the Cape Town area for 10 days in April after having spent an incredible 3 week trip to South Africa in February. For our three week trip we covered a lot of ground including Cape Town peninsula wineries Garden Route Karoo Desert wineries Addo and Kruger. This time we are hoping to visit at least a few new spots while minimizing some of the driving time.    What would you recommend for a 10-day trip to the Cape Town area in April other than the Garden Route? We will likely aim to spend 2-3 nights in the winery region again 2-3 in the Cape Town area which leaves us with 3-5 nights to explore somewhere new.    Is it worth driving up north the coast? We didn't hit Hermanus last time is this worth it in April? Other recommendations are highly appreciated!    A few things about us:  -we love nature food wine and culture.  -we are traveling with a toddler  -we are adventurous and experienced travelers so are willing to adventure a bit if worth it (knowing we have a little one in tow) ,oregonduck13,Western Cape,"Kigali, Rwanda"
Greetings! I will be bringing a party of 16 folks from the USA on a safari to South Africa. We are purposely staying at Crocodile Bridge Camp so that the folks can get an idea of what a normal camp is like to stay. However there is no restaurant at the camp. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do for dinner that night?  As it stands now I plan to stop our coach in Komatipoort at the Super Spar to buy items for a cookout / braai. This will include steaks and boerewors. However I do not know what else to get to be practical about this. I'm also assuming I will have to buy lighter fluid and charcoal to cook on? I think I think the camp bungalows provide dishes and utensils but I don't know what all is provided. This will be a fun experience but I want it to work without any surprises.  Any suggestions?  OR.... Is there a staff person at the camp we could hire to do this? ,Mike S,Kruger National Park,South Africa

Hi there    We are two female travellers (couple) planning to potentially do the garden route.    Aware this is a ridiculous question perhaps but mostly asking for reassurance purposes having read wildly differing accounts online.    We’re likely to want to do many hikes along the route - stopping at various national parks. Should we be concerned about safety in these areas (beyond the obvious of not leaving valuables on display in the car park)?    I’d assumed like most places in the world the risk of crime is predominantly centred around pockets of certain more populous areas but having read certain comments online I wanted to ask this group.    Thanks in advance! ,Doubledozen,Garden Route,

I am considering a trip to Cape Town next year.  I am an experienced traveler and have always been aware of the crime rates in South Africa however having looked deeper at government advice and read through many blogs my concerns are heightened.    I like to be independent with the ability to walk around freely with some caution but not constantly looking over my shoulder ever minute.  I have read comments about crime being no higher than those of European or US cities I am extremely experienced in navigating UKEU and US cities and have little concern in doing so.  Reading that its not safe to go out alone or at all after dark in Cape Town is a great concern for me.    Please can anyone give me feedback on this topic any recent experience would be invaluable.

Hi all firstly thks to all that responded on my previous post. Your info was so helpful. Just to get objective views about the reality of travel. Reading reports of making a quick exit from airport making sure you're not followed from car hire depot being wary getting stuff out of your car being wary at petrol stations avoiding certain gates. Makes me feel that outside of the parks we'll be constantly looking over our shoulders. I'm not a nervous traveller but I do want a holiday where we don't have to be constantly on alert especially when our kids are with us.

Can anyone advise based on recent experience:  1. Driving condition's  2. Personal safety  3. Is mid February a good time/will the crowds have settled down a little bit.  many thanks ,David W,Western Cape,"Exeter, United..."
We will be self-driving to Clarens next month through the Golden Gate Highlands National Park. I understand no park permits are required just to cross the park on the R712. But I've seen conflicting advice about whether we would have to buy permits if we wanted to make a quick detour onto one or both of very short loop-roads which run into the park off the R712. Unfortunately the SanParks website doesn't seem to provide a clear answer (unless I've been looking in the wrong place). Looking on-line some people have said in the past that permits are only needed if you overnight or hike in the park and that the loop roads are open to all. Others suggest that the loop roads do require a permit. Obviously I'm all in favour of supporting park services and I'm not trying to avoid paying what is due. But two permits for foreign visitors will total ZAR 504 which might be quite a lot for just 11 km on the loop roads - unless of course they are exceptional! I appreciate that I can if necessary ask at the park office on the day - but for planning purposes it would be very helpful to know in advance how our trip is likely to shape up.    Many thanks in advance for any advice. ,cw10,,London

Looking for insight and recommendations advisability.    Traveling to SA in September for 3 weeks we have a 10 day multiple safari experience already booked in Kruger but have time before to fill and thought taking 5 days to travel down to Cape town via back roads would be a great way to see the country and stay at some campgrounds and smaller places followed by a few days in Cape town.    we have traveled all over the US and Canada Boondocking in our own modified Pickup so we are quite happy on Gravel and secondary roads and camping rough. Our goal is to cover approx 500-600 KM per day with time for stops and such along the way.    What are the main safety issues and other concerns we should know about. Any suggestions and recommendations greatly appreciated. We are looking at renting a 4x4 with camping gear as the mode of travel. The goal is to primarily see the country with stopping at various select points along the way ( Once we figure out what those are ;-) ). ,Diverdown120s,,Kingston Ontario

We will only have 4 nights - 3 full days in Cape Town arriving the 30th of April. We will be staying in the V&A waterfront for 3 nights and moving to the Double Tree by Hilton Eastside for our last night as we join a tour that leaves at 7 am the next morning.  Our first day we intend to just catch the HO HO bus and stop off as many places as we can which hopefully includes going on the cable car to Table Mountain. The second we have booked a full day tour to Cape Hope. We would love to do the vineyard tour on the 3rd day but it seems that these are full day tours and as we will have to book out of our accommadtion in V&A and move to the Double Tree it will not be possible to do a full day tour. Suggestions for this day would be appreciated. We were thinking just to perhaps do the blue route on HO HO this day. Thanks in advance. ,imagine2,Cape Town,"Newcastle, Australia"
Planning a one off 60th birthday holiday for 4 adults all in their 60’s to South Africa .Is the Garden Route for us as the more I read the more it sounds biased towards the adventure types which we are not  don’t mind driving so is it worth staying in Cape Town for several nights and then doing a week on the garden route or a full 2-3 week exploring .

Hi Everyone    I had tried to book 3 nights in the Skukuza Safari Lodge for November and whilst the payment was taken I received no reference number or confirmation email. Having contacted them midweek I am still unfortunately not getting anywhere at the moment and it's now making me rethink this accommodation entirely.    This will be our first visit to KNP and we are flying into Skukuza airport. I thought staying in the lodge would be the easiest option and would meet most of our needs given it is a relatively new modern hotel (air conditioning generator for loadshedding clean nearby facilities for mid day activities etc) . I have read the other SAN park accommodation is very very basic and I'm not too keen on that so wonder if anyone could please give me a steer on how best to proceed if we opt not to rebook with the Skukuza Safari Lodge.    Is it easy enough to stay outside of the park (we do intend to hire a car from the airport) and drive in for around 5am each day? I am visualizing dark dirt roads but appreciate that may not be the case at all!    I reckon we'll probably only self-drive for up to 5 hours max so are there things to do outside of the park in the afternoon or can you use the facilities in the camp (such as the swimming pools / golf course etc)?    If we wanted to do a guided evening drive what would be the best way to go about this if we choose to stay outside of the park? Would that involve paying a second conservation fee for the day?    Lastly; in your opinion... if this were your decision (and I understand you may want different things from us) would you just suck it up for a few days and stay inside the park in one of the cottages?    Thanks so much in advance! ,MDadventures,Kruger National Park,"Scotland, United..."

My husband and I will be in Capetown for 4 days in May. We have never been to Africa and we're then going to Victoria Falls and then Botswana. Every time I mention we are going to Capetown without a tour. I get strange looks and the watch yourself lecture. So I'm wondering if it's really that bad.

Hi All    I am hoping there are some Car Hire staff/experts on this forum.    We are travelling from Australia and will be hiring a bakkie in Durban for two weeks.  We have hired cars in many countries (and in SA previously).  However everything we are seeing now states that international visitors MUST have a credit card as a guarantee and a debit card with a credit facility is not accepted any longer. South African residents can still use a debit card.  We will be paying for the car hire in full before we arrive so this will only be for the pre-authorisation for accident/theft.    We do not have nor do we want a credit card.    Can anyone advise on whether they have recently been able to use a Mastercard Prepaid Travel Card (or similar) as guarantee? Or has their credit function on a Debit card been accepted?  We travel in June. ,MissBehavingAgain,,Western Australia...
Hoping to come to SA this August. We are planning to do a safari for 5-7 days and spend a couple of days on either end of the trip in and around Johannesburg. But we'd also like to spend a few days somewhere else. (We'd head to Capetown and Cape Winelands if it were not the middle of winter.)    Are there any mountain lodges near Capetown where one might spend a few days and be able to go on nature walks in the bush on your own?

In some real need in some advice if anyone can.    My Wife turns 30 next year and i want to book a safari in south Africa next Easter because its her dream holiday.    Trying to price a 6 day safari but just don't know who to trust in terms off who to book it with?    Had a good price from Safariswithus https://www.safariwithus.com/packages-tours/sabi-sands-luxury-safari-5-day/ but not sure if I can trust them as I don't know anyone to use them. I know flights are not included that's fine I can sort that.    Had a price from KUONI and AUDLEY travel but they have been ridiculous prices close to 5/6 times the amount on that link but they are well known travel agents.

I might be suffering from information overload but I can't seem to find info on the day passes. I wanted to book in advance to avoid any issues but have a few questions:    - We arrive on a Friday afternoon and have an evening drive booked at one of the gates (we are staying outside the park that night). Do I need to purchase a day ticket in addition to the night drive reservation?    - We are staying outside the reserve Friday Saturday Sunday but then move to a camp inside the park. Should I prepurchase Saturday Sunday and Monday passes into the park?    - How will the day pass work when we are inside the park?

We have scheduled two nights/ one day in the area to visit the battlefields. We have a car but understand that you have to hire a guide.  We've read a detailed history of South Africa so have some understanding. But a guide would add interest.  We just got a quote for a full day tour for 3400R. That is much too expensive for us.  Some of the accommodation has significant access issues (we don't have a 4x4) so we had better stay in Dundee.  Please can we have suggestions on a more economic way to visit the battlefields.

Flying into Mbombela driving to Elephant Point for a 3 day stay. Then driving to Kapama River Lodge for 2 days and departing from Hoedspruit to Cape Town. I've checked dropping off at different airports and it is affordable.  We have 5 adults--can we get a large rental--what would you recommend? Are the roads ok from Elephant Point to Kapama--if we drive thru the park or go around it? Should we not rent a car and just hire transportation---cost seem to be about the same?

Mother daughter trip. We are looking to arrive later September for 4 days. Suggested hotels are Victoria and Alfred Cloud 9 Gorgious George More Quarters Apartments AC Marriott or other Marriott properties. We can stay for free at Marriott using points which is why I put them in the mix.    Which area is best? Does free trump other hotels and locations especially since this the the start of the trip and we will be going on Safari. I did not see any recent posting about the AC Hotel and the posting I did find was 4 years old and indicated that area is growning and the hotel was new then. Since reading information about the city we are aware we will need to be cautious when out walking especially at night when we should take an Uber. ,aedrbf,Cape Town,West Hartford...

Hello - at the very early stages of planning a trip probably to one or two Private Reserve locations in Sabi Sands. I've seen there are numerous tour companies that will help organise this and I've seen some nice example packages. I might well want to add a few nights in Cape Town on the same trip.    But I would generally have to organise my own international flights (no problem I'd rather do this anyway) and internal flights (ditto). And as far as I can see once I've got to the PR then they take care of everything. The only missing links are a few transfers which the PRs can also organise. (Or is it sensible to consider renting a car and self-transferring?).    What other value might the tour companies be able to add? Is their margin likely to wipe out any discount they can get on the PR rack rates? [i.e. is it cheaper for me to book direct?]    Guidance much appreciated. ,Loddonlily,Kruger National Park,Great Malvern...
Hi All    I'm currently planning a 3-4 night safari for our small family in late September this year and am struggling to decide between Kuname Lodge in the Karongwe Reserve vs. Simbavati River Lodge in the Timbavati Reserve.    The accomodation at Kunmae Lodge looks great especially the two bedroom option and it is also quite significantly cheaper however I'm keen to get some thoughts as to whether Simbavati would be considered more premium both from a lodge and game view perspective.

Looking for input related to the safety in Cape Town while my wife & I are there for 4 nights. Was recently told it might not be safe to walk around the city use public transportation be out after dinner etc.    Welcome any input we typically walk a great deal when exploring cities & just want to be aware if crime (more than any other major city where you avoid the dodgy areas) should be a concern.

We pick up the hire car at 11am at the airport and will stop one night on the way to PM gate. It seems that Louis Trichardt might be a nicer place to stay for the night than Polokwane. We just need somewhere around 50$ that's got a comfy bed safe parking and somewhere to eat nearby.  We will be able to get everything we need for self catering in Kruger at Louis Trichardt?  We could always do a quick stop at Polokwane on the first day if we needed a bigger store to buy things like a cool box and then buy food the next day.  Your input would be much appreciated. ,Kat T,,"Twickenham, United..."
We will be travelling by car for 2 months mostly self catering. We are looking at buying a 12v cool box and solar panel for when we are driving.

Using it with a solar panel not relying on the car battery.  Where is the best place to buy such things on route from Tambo to Punda Maria gate?  We will will be travelling around S Africa so on the road quite a few days but should have a fridge where we stay.  With load shedding this could be even more important.

Hello    Looking forward to a week in Kruger in late August. The plan is to fly into Skukuza overnight in Skukuza rest camp self-drive to Umkumbe lodge in Sabi Sands 2 days there then self drive to Berg en Dal rest camp via Pretorioskup/Skukuza Rd and on to Malelane Skukuza Rd south. Self drive a couple of days at berg en dal then Chimp Eden before driving to JNB for our onwards flight.    For all you Kruger pro's out there any red flags in this plan? I have no idea how to fix a flat. (I made it to 50 without ever needing to learn...)    I'm concerned bout the Sabi Sands driving as that's all dirt road - the lodge does offer a transfer but it's relatively pricey.    Should I pay for a higher-end vehicle with maybe a little more clearance or just a Corolla etc is good enough? What about visibility? How do I minimize my chance of flats and make sure I get a well maintained vehicle?    I believe the drive to Berg en Dal will be mostly tarred and we'll be very careful in the drives we do from that rest camp.    Thanks for any and all advice! ,looper2,Kruger National Park,"SF, CA"
Hi everyone    I am in the midst of researching our annual holiday and SA is a strong contender. I appreciate peak season is Dec-Feb time (I think) but we don’t really want to have to wait another year so are contemplating perhaps October/November which would also coincide with my husbands birthday.    We are early 30s fit and active and keen to have a pretty equal mix of chill out time and things to do. We love to eat good food run golf and live as much like a local as possible (we aren’t particularly interested “tourist traps”). Cool bars and markets would be up our street.    I love the heat (us Scots don’t get much of it) so it’s important to me to be able to lie out and soak up some of the all important vitamin D I am undoubtedly lacking but it doesn’t have to be really hot (we are used to visiting the Middle East / Vegas etc and whilst desert heat is my ideal scenario I understand we won’t get that in SA… much to my hubbys delight). Am I likely to be able to enjoy some hot days at the time of year specified?    We aren’t really wine drinkers but when in SA I feel it’s perhaps worth giving it a try? Having looked at all the wineries / vineyards I could see us being able to enjoy the scenery and food regardless - what do you reckon?    Ideally it would be good to try and see some wildlife. Im not so sure we’ll make it to Kruger as it’s likely to push things out of our budget (of £3000 total for flights accommodation & spending money for 2 weeks) and we equally don’t want to be driving here there and everywhere. Are there any game reserves close to Cape Town you could recommend? Alternatively (or maybe even in addition) we’d love to try and spot some whales / do some shark diving in Hermanus.    Lastly any recommendations on golf courses for a 4 handicapper would be great.    Thank you so much in advance. ,MDadventures,Cape Town,"Scotland, United..."

Hello    We’re have been living in Zambia and will be returning home to Canada via Cape Town mid June.  We are avid wine lovers so have extended our layover in CT to 4 night to enjoy Stellenbosch area.    We land in CT 8:30 pm. We would like to stay in an Airbnb in Stellenbosch area for all 4 nights that would mean we have to rent a car from the airport and drive late at night which we aren’t keen on for safety reasons (we’ll have lots of luggage with us).    Should we-  1. Stay at an airport area hotel the first night and rent a car the next morning to travel to Stellenbosch for the next 3 days. ( hotel and car rental location recommendations please) any budget would be ok.    2. Uber from airport to Stellenbosch Airbnb rent a cr the next day in Stellenbosch area for the duration of trip. Return car to airport on way home.  (We’ll have about 5 large suitcases with us would Uber work?)    If you have any other suggestion I’d love to hear.

I will be returning to South Africa again in the second week of April for a two week stay. The initial visa I was given will still be valid when I arrive but would expire during the stay.

I appreciate this is the Cape Town Forum the method in my madness in posting here is to ask if anyone has included Lord Milner in their itineraries/travel plans when visiting CT? I'm just starting to plan a trip for February next year where we will be revisiting Franschhoek and Hermanus adding Lord Milner for a potential two night stop in between the two.    I've read the reviews on Trip Adviser for Lord Milner itself and the travel time from/to each destination is I think do-able. My main question while I want to experience what Lord Milner is all about is two nights too long a time? Or perhaps there are other recommendations on route (either Franschoek to Matji or Matji to Hermanus) that we can also stay over at making Lord Milner a one night stay?    Thoughts/experiences welcomed. Thank you in advance.  Debbie ,lovetotravel062,Cape Town,Middlesex

Hi    My wife and I are planning to travel from Cape Town to Kambaku lodge on the 8th stay there for 4 nights and then transfer to a cheaper camp in or around KNP for some self driving experience before heading back to Cape Town on the 14th.    We will not need a car for the first leg of the trip in Kambaku but I’m unsure how to go about renting a car just for the self driving experience - any suggestions? As far as I’ve read most folks just rent cars from the airport. We’d like to know if there is an option to rent a car only for the second leg of our trip ie from Kambaku and then return the car to Hoedspruit airport on our way back.

Hello guys  I would deeply appreciate your reviews and tips about 1-day Joburg trips. We are landing at O.R. Tambo Aiport on in April 8.15 in the morning and we would like to go straight for the city tour as this is our only day in Joburg.  I was thinking about a trip offered by SafariWithUs or Beyond Africa Safaris:  https://www.safariwithus.com/packages-tours/ultimate-johannesburg-city-tour/    https://www.privatetourscapetown.com/tours/full-day-soweto-and-johannesburg-private-guided-tour    Do you think these trips are reliable and safe? We need to take our luggage with us if we go straight from the airport and I am little bit worried about taking it into the car but idk maybe it's safe with our guide? What do you think?  I have also recieved an offer from my guesthouse (Dove Nest Guesthouse in Kepmton Park near the airport)- they recommended me their tour guide (and his offer looks very good!) but I can't really check him (he is not representing any travel agency etc.) and I am little bit worried to take it. I've heard many stories about robberies in Jozi and also that even some guides may stay behind that (informing the thieves).  Please let me know if you have any tours/guides to recommend for a safe trip.  Best regards  Wojtek ,Wojtek K,Johannesburg,
I'm trying to understand about the safely level in Rosebank. Some say it's very safe but then they say don't walk after dark. We will be there when the sun sets before 7. Should we be wary about walking 4 or 5 blocks to and from the mall or a restaurant. We are in our 70s and are used to walking everywhere. The streets around the mall area look nice but also look pretty empty. ,jomart_10,Johannesburg,"Franklin, Tennessee"
I am looking for a local company that will put together a 4-5 day guided road biking trip for my husband and I. I have researched Active Adventures Backroads VBT etc and their trips are longer and some includes safaris (which we will be doing on our own later).

We are planning a trip to South Africa mid September this year. So far we only have our return flights booked to Johannesburg but our plan is to have 5 days/4 nights safari and then fly to Cape Town for our second week.    We are trying to decide whether to go to Pilanesberg or Kruger and if Kruger then which area would be best?    We are looking to book with a company that can arrange transfer accommodation and game drives / other activities. Budget around £200 per person per night (myself and my husband).    Based on previous experiences on safari in other countries our preferences would be - private or small group game drives preferably in areas that aren’t hugely overcrowded with other vehicles private bathroom facilities in lodges or ‘luxury’ tents and ideally somewhere to sit at night and watch animals visit a waterhole. Additionally we’d maybe like to go on a bush walk or have other activities available to us.    Is 5 days too long to spend in Pilanesberg? Would the additional travelling time to Kruger be worthwhile for more variety?    We’d appreciate any advice and also recommendations of who to book with.    Thank you in advance ,ckirby25,,"London, United..."
Just some advice - we booked Hilltop camp through Far & Wild Safaris and had a terrible experience. Booked through someone called Jeremy who didn’t communicate the types of accommodation available - as such we ended up in the wrong accommodation but had no idea. Jeremy was completely unapologetic when we contacted him and washed his hands of the whole affair saying he was merely a booking agent and would accept no responsibility for the camps accommodation. Will never book with them again and beware because when you go to the Hilltop camp site it takes you straight to these guys. ,peppyabc,,"Bristol, United..."

Hi all we are planning a trip to Kruger in early September. Perhaps I was a bit naïve about timely reservations since I assumed tourism would still be starting up this year. However I noticed that a few camps we would like to stay at are already quite full so I have booked what was available in these camps and will plan the rest around it.    Our situation is:  Day 1: Enter from the South side (coming from Swaziland) reservation for the night in Lower Sabie  Day 2 and 3: still to decide  Day 4: Booked the night at Satara  Day 5: Leave at the Orpen gate to go to Hoedspruit    We are now considering our options to fill the two middle days. Staying longer in Lower Sabie isn’t an option unfortunately it is fully booked for the bungalows. What would be your advice on day 2 and 3?    We read positive reviews about Berg-en-Dal and there is still availability on both days. Would it be worth staying there for two days and then make the (long) trip to Satara? Or should we stay there for one night followed by a night in Skukuza? Or is it worth going to Satara one day earlier to stay there for two days?    Choices choices choices… I know you can’t decide for us but what would be your considerations? Or do you have different suggestions? ,erikkie39,Kruger National Park,"The Hague, The..."
Jumping off my other thread    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293740-i9186-k14321762-Kruger_or_no_Kruger-South_Africa.html#116961138    Seems I can fly to Kruger in a couple weeks from JNB for under $100 at 6pm and get a small rental car for about $100.    I've never even looked at Kruger until a couple of days ago my understanding is you must follow the roads so I assume a small car is fine? I am guessing this would be much cheaper then a 'tour'    Can anyone suggest a good 3 day (maybe 4) route and a few budget places I might be able to find space in. Thank you my research begins tomorrow hoping some advice will give me a leg up ,TrvlnewBee,,"Orlando, Florida"

Hi I recently posted about getting married on Safari for a party of 5 adults and 2 children (10 and 13).    We have narrowed down our options to either 5 nights at Savanna splitting our time between Savanna and Dulini river lode or maya (allowing us to do 13km bush walk between two) or 5 nights at Tintswalo Manor House. We also love leopards Hills but potentially can only do 4 nights and room configuration isn’t as only allow 1 child and 1 adult per room.    Any key differences I should be aware of and any recommendation on which to go for? The game drives and wildlife are our priory followed by nice food and drink. We also want to ensure the children have a great time! Thanks ,thefixer85,,"Leeds, United..."

We will be in Kruger next month (can't wait!)    We will be spending two nights inside Kruger and then two nights at Shindzela tented camp (I think). For the first night we were thinking of getting to Skukuza rest camp - this doesn't look too far from Kruger gate. Should we stay both nights right here in Skukuza or drive to Satara the next night?    We were thinking that we would drive to Satara with a lunch stop in Lower Sabie (if the roads are clear by then). So we wouldn't have to drive back all the way to Skukuza and we get to see more of the park. ,sushraya,,North Billerica...
Hello  I am planning a trip to South Africa in the middle of November- I’m reading mixed information on weather. It seems the safaris will be colder in the morning but then during the day it warms up?  Is the weather in November warm enough to spend time at a pool? We will have some down time during the day so want to know if a pool is too cold to go in.  Thank you!! ,Stephanie W,,

We'll be in South Africa in August and also visiting Victoria Falls. The best flight times and prices for our flight from Victoria Falls and some of our internal flights are on Fastjet or on Hahn Air codeshares with Fastjet. I've been unable to contact Fastjet by email or Whats App which makes me nervous. Has anyone used them before? I'm wondering how reliable they are.    Additionally for our flight from Johannesburg to Vic Falls the only option is a 10:30 am flight on South African Airline. We have to come in from Madikwe on a charter that morning. We will be checking bags. Since this is an international flight is it necessary to arrive 2 hours early? Is OR Tambo a big airport and typically crowded and time-consuming? ,BenDiver_TX,Johannesburg,"Houston, Texas"

I am travelling from the US to Cape Town for a 10 day trip. I had hoped to book 2 or three nights at Kapama Reserve at the end of our time in South Africa. We are leaving for a 16 hour flight back to NYC on a Saturday evening and was wondering if it makes sense to come back to Cape Town from Hoedspruit the day before and stay at a hotel near the airport to catch our flight the next evening or to go back to Cape Town for Friday overnight and go back to the airport the next day Saturday. Is there a decent hotel at the airport to stay with perhaps something to see or do before our flight out? Or should we just go back to Cape Town? The other option - fly back on Saturnday from Hoedspruit and stay at the airport until our flight leaves that night sounds awful. Thanks! ,Treesamia76,Cape Town Central,"Newtown, Connecticut"

Hi all just have a question 2 actually and hoping I might get clarification on here have also posted this on the air travel forum    Im flying Qantas melbourne (Australia) - Sydney-Johannesburg on the 1 ticket  Stop in Sydney is 2 hrs from landing to next departure will this be enough time as I have to also factor in getting to a different terminal which is a short distance away from domestic terminal?    Where would I be doing immigration the outbound sector? Melbourne ( first flight) or Sydney?  Obviously if Sydney that stresses me a little if in melbourne no problem    Im guessing hopefully bags would be checked all the way to Johannesburg has anyone done this flight or have any insight id appreciate it thanks so much ,fkilby,,"Melbourne, Australia"

We're visiting South Africa next week for a 11 day trip from the States with our teenager. We're splitting it by spending 7 days in Cape Town 3 days doing the Safari at KNP and 1 day back in Cape Town for our return flight. I know the day we land in Cape Town will be exhausting after a long flight so we may essentially have 5 full days as the 7th day will be a flight for the Safari. We'll probably have half the day before flying back when we come back to Cape Town for a day.  On our to-do list is the Shark cage & Crocodile cage and all the attractions in Cape Town. What are some of the attractions that we can do ourselves in Cape Town using either the red bus tour or Uber? What all can be club in a day along the same route? Also what all will need a guided tour? We're open to doing guided tours but also prefer to do whatever we can on our own at our pace. ,she v,,

We will arrive at JNB after a long haul flight spend 2 nights then depart to Kasane Botswana. I’m very conflicted as to where to stay.

Hi    I'm planning a honeymoon for November this year and trying to convince my fiancé that we can afford to go to South Africa and Mauritius instead of backpacking in Vietnam! Looking for any advice/tips. (Looking at budget of ~£4-6k and around 3 weeks)    My current thinking is fly into Cape Town spend 2/3 nights here then drive the Garden Route/Wine train land for 7/8 nights ending in Port Elizabeth. From there fly to Durban and spend 3 nights in one of the safari reserves around KZN as these seem much cheaper than the Kruger ones and I really just want to see some giraffes. Then head to Johannesburg to fly to Mauritius as it's direct from here. Not sure that there's much to see/do in Johannesburg so maybe just overnight by the airport somewhere?    Does this sound reasonable? I'm thinking a mix of fancy safari thing and then more budget/mid-range everywhere else. Is it easy enough to hire a car from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth and then Durban to Johannesburg? Or should we just carry on driving the whole way? Or would we be better to look at tours/taxis/transfer? What's the driving conditions like? I've heard some concerns about safety/car jacking are there places/roads we should avoid?    Also if anyone has recommendations for car hire or local tour companies than can help with booking organizing but don't cost £££.    Thanks :) ,Sarah R,,Manchester
Exceptionallly disappointing service offering from Travelstart.  - book trip two flights each way  - departure goes fine  - when we return the tickets are voided  - travelstart blames airlink  - airlink quickly gatheers facts and proves it's Travelstart  - travelstart replaces our tickets but the second flight is full.  - we get pushed into cheap accommodation no breakfast or meals. no contact (from Travelstart). Call centers don't operate after 4pm.  - promised I'd get a call when we landed never happened. Zero care past 4pm.  - inconvenience of not being home on time  My suggestion is to book flights with a proper travel agency who when THEY make a mistake suitably correct it and care for their clients. very disappointing. ,Marisa T,,"Storms River, South..."
You TA folks have been so awesome as I plan this last minute trip I was hoping for some more suggestions/help.    Thinking 2 nights/3 days in Stellenbosch or Franschhoek before 4 days in CT followed by Safari. I was leaning toward Franschhoek as it seemed more 'walkable' thought I'd throw out my options.    Option 1 - Transfer (I haven't found a transfer company yet) to Stellenbosch or Franschhoek spend two relaxing walkable days just enjoying the surroundings. Transfer (or mass transit bus or ?) to CT day 3. Transfer cost unknown?    Option 2 - Land CPT rent a car at airport return Loop Street Cape Town on day 3. This gives me more freedom but I wasn't planning a lot of driving with wine drinking. Most freedom but not as relaxing. Cost of car under $100 (+gas and tolls if there are any?)    Option 3 - Stay another area in CT for 2 nights and day trip/tour to wine region(s). Easy but wastes the most time. Tour costs vary    As I was typing this another option came to mind    Option 4 - If you experts tell me go for Option 2 (rental car) maybe you'd suggest I don't bother with Stellenbosch or Franschhoek go somewhere else and then just do a day tour during my 4 days in CT    I have no doubt you'll provide some great feedback    **Right after posting I received a quote for 1200 RAR from Airport to Franschhoek. Seems a bit pricey but maybe it's not? ,TrvlnewBee,Cape Town,"Orlando, Florida"

Excerpt from letter to the exec team to share with others  Based on a formality in relation to a payment that had been followed up by the Strand Street Branch with me I did not have a chance to respond to an email I received in a timely fashion being unaware that this would lead to the involvement of an investigator who was not only chasing me down the street by driving recklessly and breaking multiple traffic rules but threatened to physically harm me and verbally abused me - and finally broke the key of my car - which required me to return home unexpectedly and to wait for a replacement car to be provided.    As it stands this was all the result of an email that I hadn't respond to and I can't even express the level of disappointment and disgust in relation to the unprofessional poor and unacceptable handling of the matter and will follow up on the physical and emotional abuse.    If you would please be so kind as to point me into the right direction with regards to next steps in terms of addressing the complaint at the highest level of seniority since I am of the opinion that no business dealing with customers and more importantly putting their customers first should be treating their clients like this.    The fact that I had been put through this is an absolute disgrace and I trust in your ability to find an appropriate solution for this. ,Elninodelsol,Cape Town Central,Cape Town Central...

We travelled for 7 weeks in Feb-March 2023 and I would like to share 2 with you from South Africa.    JOHANNESBURG: After lots of research on TA I fortunately found Moses Molepe. He owns mtmtours. He was very quick to reply to all my emails. I arranged for him to pick us up from the airport (he was waiting for us at 2am as our flight was 2 hours late) and 2 full day tours (Pretoria & Diamond Mine — Johannesburg & Soweto). I love quality/price and he is just that! He has been driving/guiding for many years but you can see he loves his job. He also dropped us off at the airport for us to fly to Victoria Falls. I booked Moses about 6 weeks before our arrival. Trust me you can not find better. moses@mtmtours.co.za +27 11 766 5417    CAPE TOWN: As CT was our last stop on our epic holiday I slacked off and had not arranged a driver/guide. After our arrival at our accommodation the owner of the condo gave us the name of Godfrey Manual. I contacted him and AGAIN we were blessed with the expertise gentleness and great quality/price of this guide/driver. Godfrey toured us for 3 full day and dropped us off at the airport. He really became a friend and we will miss him. You can reach Godfrey Manual at info@impresstours.com +27 83 261 9597    Please private message me if you have any questions.

I am going to Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park early April thru Mata Mata from Namibia.    As it’s tough to reserve BOT side campsites we should get out of the park after staying 2 nights at ZA side. We are considering to drive out to KAA Gate of BOT.    There seems to be two options for this course : Kannaguass-KAA route (184km) and Polentswa Wilderness Trail (257km).    Which way would you recommend in terms of easy drive and time consuming? Is it enough to drive just one day? We will drive Toyota Hilux with 2 roof tents.    If we cannot arrive at KAA gate before sunset what shall we do? Can we sleep anywhere?    If we arrive before sunset but there’s no vacancy at KAA campsites where should we go further for sleeping?    Appreciate any advice. ,jay,Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park,"Seoul, South Korea"
Hi All after a failed honeymoon attempt in 2020 thanks to Covid our flights to South Africa are now booked for October/November :-). We have 17 days in total. We have booked a 2 day safari at Pumba private game reserve so need to fly from Joburg to PE. We also know we want a good stretch in Cape Town (4-5 nights) and 2-3 nights in Franschoeek (for all the fine dining and wine). We love fine food fine wine and fine hotels BUT also love nature and getting out on a hike seeing waterfalls and landscapes. The garden route is calling to me but my wife.is worried it will be too much driving and not very relaxing. I see her point but equally we may get to experiment something we wouldn't by just flying around the country.    My question is this - we have roughly 6 days to play with and is that enough time to drive from PE to Franschoeek or is it too rushed? Is that just too much driving /not very relaxing and should we just get an internal flight and max out time in other places?    The itinerary looks a little like this and any opinions welcome    D1 - Arrive Joburg 9am. Spend 1 night.  D2- Fly to PE. Transfer to Pumba  D3- Pumba  D4- Transfer pumba to PE arrive late pm.  D6 Storms river ?  D7 Storms River?  D8 Plet Bay  D9 Wilderness  D10 Mossel Bay (via scenic route of Oudtshoorn)  D11 Franschoeek  D12 Franschoeek  D13 Franschoeek or CPT?  D14 CPT  D15 CPT  D16 CPT  D17 Fly to Joburg for 10pm flight home (nb due to the BA Avios flights we had to fly in and out of here otherwise would have gone straight to CPT)    I've tried looking at Google maps TA YT channels and blogs and the stops along GR I have planned look achievable and without too much driving? But at end of day it's a honeymoon we both have stressful jobs and want to return home relaxed so if flying is easiest option then happy to go for that.    Ant help appreciated. ,JohnM,,"London, United..."
Hi everyone    Will be based at Camps Bay for a week in early September without a car.

Hi everyone! Definitely appreciate any help here. Going to Cape Town on April 1st and I could use a couple logistic/selection help. Budget is not really an issue we are early 30s and we are generally ok bouncing around. For food/places we like any mix of good food/drinks good view/venue and good scene/ambience.    Day 1 (Saturday) - Land late - transfer to Stellenbosch    Day 2 (Sunday) - Wineries Part 1  1. Thelema or Tokara  2. Lunch at Delaire Graff  3. Rustenberg or Glenelly  4. Lanzerac  5 Waterford  6. Dinner?    -- Question 1: Would love some input on the or (or both) selections for wineries or if I am missing out on a must go to winery for the route.  -- Question 2: I am struggling to figure out what would be a good dinner selection on a Sunday. We are staying near Vrede en Lust. Not sure if I should do a wine estate downtown Stellenbosch or downtown Franschhoek. A lot of places appear closed on Sundays. Any help would be great!    Day 3( Monday) - Wineries Part 2/Cape Town Transition  1. Anthonj Rupert or Leeu  2. Boschendal  3. Babylonstoren  4. Kanokop  5.Transfer to Cape Town  6. Dinner at Pot Luck    --Question 3 - Any substitutions suggested winery wise?    Day 4 (Tuesday) - Cape Town  1) V&A waterfront/general unplanned exploration day  2) afternoon cocktail at Gin Bar  3) Hike Lion's Head/sunset  4) Jazz night at Asoka    No questions for this day    Day 5 (Wednesday) - Cape Town  1. Morning - Table Mountain (1.5 hours) (can do on Day 4 based on weather)  2. Beaches (clifton and Saunder's Rock Beach Camp's Bay - lunch in Camp's Bay - Cod Father or Chinchilla) (4) hours  3. Optional - bike Sea Point  4. Kirstenbosh Gardens - (1.5 hours)  5. Dinner at Tintswalo Altantic  6. Bars - Athletic Club    --Question 4 - Does Kirstenbosh make the most sense this day or as a tack-on to the Cape Drive?    Day 6 (Thursday)  1. Cape Point Drive - planned route  A. Muizenberg beach - morning (short stop)  B. Kalk Bay - antique store shopping/fish n chips early lunch/ cocktail or wine with water view  C. Boulders/penguins  D. Walk to Cape Point/Walk to Dias Beach  E. Chapman's Peak Hout Bay  F. Llandudno Beach - rock hike/maybe rock jump into water?  G. Dinner - 7:30 p.m. Kloof Street House    --Question 5 - How long on average should I plan for this cape point drive? I thought I read 4-5 hours.  -- Question 6 - Is Dias beach worth the hike?  --Question 7 - Does this order make sense? My gut says to do Boulder's first and then back track to avoid massive crowds (not a big tourist crowd person).  -- Question 8 - Should we do Chapman's Peak both ways (the toll does not bother us)?    Any general critiques/advice welcome and I truly appreciate everyone's insight here.    Thanks again! ,hsak21,Cape Town Central,"Chicago, Illinois"

Appreciate any suggestions on the best way to get to Signal Hill for a city view drive hike or bus. I note that the HoHo city-sightseeing bus doesn't go to Signal Hill. I also know it is not recommended to stay there after dark for personal safety reason.

Looking to book this in November. The reviews are so variable it is hard to make sense of it. Some reviews are just awful (blood/urine on the beds).  We were thinking of booking a two bed chalet as we have a car and can be self catering.  Has anyone been there recently? Is the hotel much better than the chalets?  Is there anywhere else in the park which might be suitable??  Thanks ,Kat T,,"Twickenham, United..."
Hi    I'm traveling to SA with my family (two adults and three children aged 17 15 10) in November. We have decided to focus this trip around Drakensberg mountains and the Garden Route.  I'm trying to squeeze in a Sani Pass Tour before we go to Champagne Castle Resort for 3 nights and Ndaka for 3 nights.    The plan is to fly from Australia to Johannesberg and then directly onto Durban. We'd then set out the next day for Sani Pass. I now see its a 12-13 hour tour from Durban which is a huge day.    I have a couple of options but not sure what makes sense as not really sure if I can trust driving times.  1. Do the Sani Pass tour return from Durban. (I'd love to hear if other family's have done this and how their experience was.  2. Drive to Underberg and do the tour from there and then stay the night in Underberg after the tour. (this would cut night out of our three night stay at Champagne Castle Resort).  3. Finish the tour about 4pm in Uderberg and drive to Champagne Castle Resort (I think about a 3.5 hour drive). I'm not sure if this is a difficult drive or considered unsafe to be arriving about 7:30 pm?  Any insights are welcome. I keep reading Sani Pass is not to be missed but perhaps I am not judging the distances well and I should save this bit for another trip.  Thank you! ,Cristi M,Durban,North Ward...

We have been on 9 day safari in Kenya in the past and as part of a trip to SA will be doing 3 days (5 game drives and a walking safari) at Mabula Game Lodge (already set) as well as 2 days in Choba after the falls.

Hi All my wife and I are visiting KNP end of July and will be staying at Skukuza Umkumbe and Shindzela 3 night each. We will be flying into JNB (7 AM) and rent a car. We are planning to spend the night in Sabie or Graskop or any other surrounding area with plans to explore the panoramic route the following day.    Question 1: Would you recommend staying at Sabie or Graskop or any other town (considering safety and loding/good availability)?    Question 2: We plan to wake up super early the next day and explore the panoramic route. We dont mind whole day of driving esp as we will be (hopefully) well rested the day before. We are planning on covering Mac Mac Falls Pilgrim's Rest God's Window Lisbon Falls Burke's Luck Potholes Lowveld View and Three Rondavels. We were REALLY hoping to visit Blyde also. However if we add Blyde River Canyon google map is making us take a big loop north from Three Rondavels (R532 -- R36 -- -R531) and adding almost 2.5 hrs to the drive. Plus additional drive time to get back to Sabie/Graskop (through R40-- R536). Total drive time per google maps = ~ 7 hrs.  Without adding Blyde River Canyon total drive time per google maps = ~ 3.5 hrs.    From google search many other map routes for panoramic route dont show this north loop; so we are a bit confused.    I have heard the north loop drive from Three Rondavels to Blyde is really beautiful and of course the canyon itself looks gorgeous. If we did not do this loop will we still get any glimpse of the canyon or one must do this loop to actually see the canyons?    If we must do the loop to see the canyon (which we really want to) do you think it is realistic to cover all the places I mentioned above in one day or should we skip a couple (and which ones) to save time?    Sorry for the really long queestion. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  '  Cheers!    Craig ,Craig,Kruger National Park,"Houston, Texas"

Hi    Any advice most welcomed!    We're looking for a relaxing couples break either at Ellerman House in Bantry Bay or Tintswalo Atlantic in Hout Bay - both hotels look beautiful but which area is best to stay for less wind?    I know Bantry Bay is the least windiest but is Hout Bay also protected from much of the wind?    If we want to sunbath and swim in the pools is perhaps end of November not the best time? I am only stuck to November because the hotels I am considering are fully booked this December-February so is it worth waiting another year to get the warmer weather?    We're also looking at teaming Cape Town with safari - again if anyone has any tips on whether to go to the Eastern Cape or Sabi Sands near Kruger Park I would be most grateful.    We will not have a car so both would require an internal flight but which is better?    I'd prefer malaria free but I also don't want that to hinder our overall authentic safari experience - we have never been on safari before!    if anybody can help many thanks in advance! ,777Traveller1000,Cape Town Central,Cardiff

We are arriving at 09:00 at JBN collecting our rental car and heading for Kruger. The first night we plan to stay outside the park. Second night is at Skukuza.    We have stayed in Hazyview before (2016 and 2018) and entered via Phabeni gate. Our plan was to do this again shopping at the large mall in Hazyview the following morning before entering the park.    Opinions on the forum are that is that it is better (with regards to safety) to avoid Numbi and Paul Kruger Gate using Malelane or Phabeni instead.    Looks like the driving distances from JNB are the same for Hazyview and Malelane (around 5 hours)    If we entered via Malelane where is the best place for groceries. Nelspruit or Malelane??? Is there a Woolworths enroute (or another supermarket) we would prefer a one stop shop to make like easier.    Thanks for any suggestions and input…. ,Tracy,Kruger National Park,"Breda, The..."

We are looking to spend 2 nights at arathusa safari lodge in northern sabi sands followed by 2 nights in one of the following lodges:    Rockfig safari lodge in Timbavati  Ulusaba safari lodge in west sabi sands  kirmans kamp in south sabi sands    Out of the 3 suggested can anyone suggest which might combine best with arathusa in terms of giving a slightly different experience / different terrain perhaps?    I am quite confused about how you transfer between lodges. For example although Rockfig looks furthest away on the map I am not sure if you can drive straight through sabi sands from arathusa to kirkmans due to the traversing rights?  or would you need to literally exit the park at the north gate drive all the way around and then re-enter at the south gate? If so is this actually more complicated than going to rockfig which looks to be close to Hodespruit airport anyway to fly out?    Thanks very much in advance to anyone that can help! ,sophie_hc_1990,Kruger National Park,"Edinburgh, United..."

My husband and I have 2 weeks' off work to travel anywhere in the world and one on our bucket list is South Africa. We would travel the first 2 weeks of May and would be travelling from the UK with our 2 year old. We would like to see Cape Town and do the Garden Route drive. Questions:  - is it better to start the holiday in Cape Town and finish near Port Elizabeth? are there any recommended family friendly safari lodges near there where we can start our holiday? (I understand most game drives don't allow under 6 year olds).  Then hypothetically we would drive from PE along the GR stopping in a few places and ending in Cape Town.

Hi everyone - I’m laying over in Cape Town for 3h55m (from Skukuza - Cape Town - Dubai - Chicago) June 20th.    Found a helicopter tour CivAir that is located right outside the airport. They have a 20 minute tour that I would love to take. My question is how long is customs or any of the steps once I arrive in Cape Town? I have no check in luggage only a carry on so I’ll hopefully save time on that.    Also when people say you have to be at the airport 2 hours prior to departure is that the earliest or latest?    Arrive - 2:25pm  Depart - 6:20pm    Drive to tour - ~ 10mins  Tour - 20mins  Drive from tour - ~ 10mins  ~ 40-60mins    So if I land at 2:25pm / out hopefully by 3pm / 1h for entire helicopter experience (to/from including) that ideally would get me back by 4pm roughly. What’s everyone’s thoughts? Thanks a lot! 🙏 ,Gino V,Cape Town,"Chicago, Illinois"
Has anyone ever taken a helicopter or aeroplane tour with CivAir? Or even heard of them before? Considering booking a tour but can’t seem to find many reviews. Need to wire payments prior so just want to make sure it’s a legitimate company. Thanks a lot for any help or info! 🙏 ,Gino V,Cape Town,"Chicago, Illinois"
Hi All  Has anyone had any experience of booing the park run game drives ? We have tried to book via email but have had sporadic communication. I was sent an invoice for one of the drives we wanted to book but it missed off the second one. I have emailed twice to correct this but no reply. I was also only given bank transfer as a method of payment. It would cost me more in international transfer fees than the game drive itself! Just wondering if I am missing a better way of doing this. Our visit is from 31st Jan to 02nd Feb.  Thank in Advance ,Jessica N,Addo Elephant National Park,

Hi    Where do I pass a place to buy outdoor trousers somewhere near Olifants and Mopani restcamp in Kruger?  My suitcase got lost on my way to South-Africa and I bought almost everything I need the most essantials. I only need a light pair of outdoor trousers because with the rainfall it is and these temperatures only wearing a pair of jeans or sweatpants isn't comfortable and to be honest: realllly crap.    Do I pass a store near Olifants and Mopani where I can buy a light breathable pair of outdoor trousers? Comparable with Northface or other outdoor brands? ,EHGeL O,Kruger National Park,

Hello everyone  I’m planning a trip for myself and my son for late august/early September next year. By that time my son will have turned 18 I want to give him one last really good trip before he joins the forces and moves away in late September.  I have a travel company putting some quotes and ideas together but would like to price up doing it myself too.  Iv promised him I’d take him on safari his whole life and now is the time. His other dream is great white shark cage dive I believe this time of year is also good for this?    My questions are as complete safari novices at this time of year where would the best locations be for us to have best chance of good animal spotting?  How would you recommend best travelling from say Cape Town to safari lodge?  And basically any recommendations you might give to safari newbie’s planning their first trip!  Many thanks ,nicki,,"Saltash, United..."
Firstly i'll explain where i have planned for this trip. My friend from Canada and I from Australia are meeting in Cape Town and spending 5 days there before spending a couple of weeks in Namibia on a self drive safari. I have enough leave to make it 4 weeks away plus the flights are cheaper if i arrive on Monday (meeting my friend in Cape Town on the  Sunday). We've both travelled a fair bit and we were in Ethiopia in 2019/2020.    I've been to Johannesburgh and Kruger NP before So thought originally of driving in a loop through eSwatini to Durban then the Sani pass and back to Joberg but that looks like a lot of driving so instead thinking of spending 5-7 Days in and around Durban. Is that too much time. I assume i can hire a 4WD to do the Sani pass and stay the night in Lesotho and come back or is there more to see ?    Just looking at a good way to fill in that week bearing in mind I'll be doing a lot of Safari in Namibia (4 days in Etosha) although I'm not against visitng more wildlife/safari places because I love animals but probably prefer something different ie a place that specialises in a certain species for example. Is there much to do in durban? would 1-2 days there be ok?    Any thoughts or ideas. would be appreciated? Anywhere else in South Africa or nearby i could spend time. I thought about Vic falls again as it was amazing last time but thats more flying. ,Justin W,KwaZulu-Natal,"Canberra, Australia"

Dears I plan to rent a car to drive from CT to Cape Agulhas in the first week of May. I would seek your recommendations on the following questions:    (1) How may nights to stay along the scenic route are considered not much a stretch in driving?    (2) Which town(s) will you recommend to stay overnight with good selection of restaurants?    (3) Where should I make a view stop for must-sees such as Penguin watch etc? (I know I would not see Whales in May in Hermanus) ,MOMA88,Cape Town,"Shanghai, China"
Hi    I will be arriving in JNB airport around 6:30am and I would like to head straight to Sabi Sands. I am looking to book either Umkumbe safari lodge or Elephant Plains.

What is the recent situation concerning safety of suitcases at the Tambo airport of Johannesburg? Me and my husband both travel with soft top suitcases with wheels ( duffel bag type on wheels) to Johannesburg we do not transfer and continue but fly direct into Johannesburg from Europe. We will off course put a lock on the zips of our suitcase. Is it necessary to get it wrapped are there a lot of reports on thefts into suitcases on Tambo airport and does wrapping help against that or is wrapping not really necessary? We will carry our valuable items in our handluggage our luggage will only hold clothes and shoes... ,Veerle V.,Johannesburg,"Bruges, Belgium"
Hello experts. I’ve spent hours trying to find the right day tour for me from Cape Town. Some did not accept a solo traveler. One didn’t pick up from the V&A Waterfront hotel. Etc etc  What I want to include:  Chapmans Peak  Boulder Beach  Cape Point  Cape of Good Hope    What I don’t prioritize :  Winery  Shopping    Anything I can do from the Hop on bus I will do separately. I can’t see that any of the routes include Chapmans Peak?    I’m not too concerned with price. I have a fear being crammed into the back seat of a mini van that is hard to get in and out of. I could do a private tour but not sure I want that much attention.    Thanks! ,Nemokota,Western Cape,Philadelphia...

A question for the regular visitors or residents; What are some of your favourite day drives out of Cape Town?    Speaking as a resident our day drives can vary a bit in length. Today we did a particularly long one but an old favourite: Up the N1 past Worcester and De Doorns turn right on the R318 through the Koo valley to Montagu through Bonnievale and Stormsvlei and then turn right on the N2 and back to CT. Stops at Ou Meul Du Toitskloof Montagu Hotel and Gabrielskloof. 9 hours and 500km.    What are some of yours? ,Gerald D,Cape Town,Cape Town Central...

Very soon I will be in Joburg for 2 weeks. I am a very experienced traveler (70 plus) countries and I usually travel alone (male mid 30s). Out of all the places I've been I have only been in a shady situation once (in Morocco). So usually when I hear that a place is dangerous or not safe it is from someone who has no real knowledge or from someone from that country who just lives in a really bad city where you would not think to travel to. I assume that as long as you don't go looking for trouble you will be ok. But for some reason it seems like (based upon the constant talk of joburg) that trouble will come and find you. Is it really that bad?    Currently I have an airbnb booked in the CBD which I'll likely cancel and move it to somewhere else. I am renting a car and plan to drive around and also do day trips to the four other countries within range. What area should I actually stay in? I actually heard CBD from a couple articles but reading on this forum says otherwise. ,Johnny K,Johannesburg,
Hello we live in France and will be travelling to Kruger in May. I am trying to figure out the best (and cheapest) way to stay connected with our kids at home. It would be helpful to hear how other international travellers did : did you buy a SIM card + airtime and data at the airport ? I understand operators Vodacom and MTN have the best coverage. Would you recommend Vodacom or MTN? On a practical note: how does it work? I suppose if you remove your current sim card and put in a new one it will give you a new phone number? I have also heard about international roaming but not sure how that works. We checked with our current operator and the proposed international plans (for outside of Europe) were quite expensive. Thanks for your help! ,Lynn,Kruger National Park,"Paris, France"
I'm traveling to JNB to go to a private game reserve lodge for 4 nights in July. I'll be with my father (79 year old and not as mobile) and mother (75 year old in good shape) my kids (8 and 6 year old daughters) and sister and her son (10). We are staying at a very nice lodge in South Africa which is why budget will do 4 nights. However going that far from the States to South Africa is a long journey. Is there anywhere else in the world you would recommend tying into the travel to make being away from the States worth it? I know a lot of flights fly through Europe and/or Dubai/Doha but wrestling with what else to do for a few days to make it worth it. Thanks for your feedback! ,RyanS701,,"Birmingham, Alabama"

Hi all looking to add 3 nights of additional safari onto a trip whose itinerary includes 3 nights Cape Town 6 nights Botswana (2 safari’s) and 3 nights at Victoria Falls. We will be flying out of Johannesburg so are considering either Marataba mountain lodge or Mala Mala camp. Wondering how these compare regarding quality of lodge experience abundance of animals and value (I think Mala Mala is a bit more costly). One thing I hope to increase my likelihood of seeing is Rhino since where we are going in Botswana does not have many. Luxury level is not our top concern but rather safari quality and value. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. ,Joseph T,,"Seattle, Washington"

We will be flying into Cape Town in 2024 spending 4 nights (this is focused on wine  then transferring to Sabi Sands for 4 nights (focused on safari) . I need advice for best wine regions around Cape Town. I have read about several. Too narrow it down... I'll use Napa as an example- in that Napa is used in a generic sense. For example we are Yountville people. We like high end restaurants and small privately owned vineyards with small groups or private tastings with the owners. I need some recommendations of regions accommodations and companies with drivers that can set up tasting days. Thanks so much for any expert help. I have to get started in order to get started! I have a travel agent that is great but I am open to other companies as well. ,L F,,New Orleans...

Hello! We have booked to stay at Notten’s Bush Camp next year (can’t wait!) however they could not accommodate us for the 6 nights we wanted. We really don’t want to spend a lot of time on transfers and so we were wondering if we booked a couple of nights at Umkumbe Safari lodge would we be able to transfer directly to Nottens? It seems so close but I wasn’t sure if there were routes/roads between them that were not permitted? We also looked at staying at Skukuza and self driving for a few nights but the car hire costs are absolutely crazy! Thank you ,ScottishCowgirl,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,scotland

(2) Can I drive to Table Mountain from Green Point or City Center area?  (3) is it SAFE to drive solo from CT to Hermanus Franskraal Cape Agulhas? Will I be stopped by fake police for robbery?

We are coming to Cape Town from the UK at the end of December primarily to attend a family wedding in Stellenbosch. We intend staying for a few days in Stellenbosch and then moving to Cape Town.

However when looking to book something for early January it appears that every game reserve has no vacancies for the whole month either day trips or overnight accommodation.

Looking to travel in June to a Safari for the first time and getting overwhelmed with the options. Really just looking for something with a fair price for good value and it seems that reading through there are just too many lodges but similar experiences almost everywhere. I have thought about doing the below lodges and would like to hear what people have to say.  1. Kampala River Lodge or Kapama Buffalo Camp. I am not sure how I feel about the reserved being fenced in and I’ve read is a very commercial feeling.  2. Arathusa Lodge. Seems to have great value wonder if this is really one of the best for the price range?  3. Nkorho seems to be a very good option not sure what people may think compared to the other options.    Although I prefer not to spend that much I’ve also read up on Ulusaba Virgin lodge and I wonder if there is that much difference in terms of experience between the other “lower tier” lodges and a lodge like Ulusaba.    Again any advice is great and appreciated as I am getting overwhelmed by just reading all there is out there. My wife and I don’t need anything fancy and since it’s our first time also don’t need the super authentic experience seeking more a good introductory lodge for our first time with good game viewing but if possible with not huge crowds and touristy feel. Again all advice is greatly appreciated. ,Antonio Elias V,,"Austin, Texas"
We are doing a safari in the Klasarie reserve and will end at Hoedspruit as part of our honeymoon trip in September/October. We would love to spend a few days staying in the Drakensberg mountains and doing some hiking and hopefully relaxing in a nice hotel or bed and breakfast along the way. How do you recommend getting to Drakensberg? Are there any base camp towns or small towns that have easy access to the trails of the mountains near Hoedspruit? Are there any wild animals that we need to be aware of while hiking? We are from the states and we have bears and mountain lions so we want to be prepared!

Hi All    I am seeking your expert opinion on trip planning. My wife and I will be traveling from the US to South Africa end of July 2023 and we plan to spend 9 nights - 3 nights in the Kruger National Park (Skukuza) 3 nights in Sabi Sands/Mala Mala region and 3 nights in Timbavati. Our main focus is on game drives - predominantly spotting leopards among other magnificent 8 while keeping the budget to the lowest possible. Luxury is NOT something that we seek on a trip like this when the budget is constrained. We will have a car for self-driving in Kruger NP and to travel from one lodge to another.    I have read the posts seen the reviews on several lodges and browsed through the websites of various lodges/camps.    Questions:    1. Please correct me if I am wrong but it appears that the main difference between these lodges within a specific region (say Sabi Sands) is the lodging + food but the game drive experience should be fairly similar. Is that right to assume? I am hoping that we would not compromise on the game drives if we selected some economical lodges over the more expensive ones.    2. Also are the areas where they take you for the game drives (say within Sabi Sands/Mala Mala region) quite different for each lodge? I.e. does staying at an expensive lodge offer better topography/ chance of spotting wild life over an economical/budget option? I understand luck plays a huge role in that.    Thanks so much in advance!    Craig ,Craig,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,"Houston, Texas"
Hello wise community. Thank you for your guidance thus far we are so grateful.

Flight at 4.45pm    My questions;  I’ve heard the wildlife viewing may be limited on walking tour so o wondered about doing an early morning game drive at park prior to wilderness trail. Should we then stay at mpika on 6th instead of leopard tree lodge?  Is it worth doing an isimangalisa night tour?  Any other suggestions?    Big thank you! ,Farzana M,St Lucia,"Cape Town, Western..."

We are spending 3 months in SA - October-January. We are travelling JB Kruger Drakensberg south coast Cape Town with various national parks on route. We are hiring a vehicle. We have the choice between a 2 door Toyota Hilux and a Hyundai Venue. The Hilux is probably not 4x4 but it will have better ground clearance etc. (4x4 is too expensive).  The trade off is that the Venue will be more comfortable and have a more secure boot for luggage etc.  What we don't know is how many roads in SA are not paved.  For security we will not be going into hinterlands but we did notice ( as an example) that one of the places we'd like to go to in the Drakensberg is along a road which is not paved.  I appreciate this might be a difficult question to answer when you dont know our exact route but it would be really helpful if to know if a lot of roads have a rough surface.  We are choosing between these two vehicles only.  Thanks for any input. ,Kat T,,"Twickenham, United..."

So I would like to ask the experts in this forum:  1) Is there a best time to visit Cape Town where the weather is nice and it's not overly crowded with travelers?  2) Can this be combined with Namibia and Botswana or should that be a separate trip because the best times to travel do not coincide?

Hi all    We're a family of 5 (2 adults 1 elder 1 8-yr old and 1 2-yr old) planning a trip to the Hluhluwe area. I have a few questions for the smart people of this forum:    1. We are planning a 2-day stay at a lodge in the town of Hluhluwe. I expect that the activities at the lodge (nature walks pool various kid tours) and a safari drive may take up all our time. Does it make sense to add on another night in St. Lucia for a different set of activities? I've never been to St. Lucia but have been to Hluhluwe-Imfolozi a few times so trying to figure out how many days we need in total.    2. We have an active 2-yr old and trying to gauge whether there is any safari that would be appropriate for him. First would any company allow a 2-year old on a paid safari? Or should we just self-drive? Second if we self-drive does Hluhluwe-Imfolozi make any sense for him given the big distances we have to cover to see wildlife?    3. If we do go to Hluhluwe-Imfolozi does anyone have thoughts on whether the northeastern part of the park or southwestern part of the park is better for wildlife viewing? I can't recall the parklands at all.    4. Finally we are vegetarians who love good food. Open to all recommendations for cafes and restaurants you might recommend that cater to veg-heads :)    Thanks for your expert advice!  Virali ,v_qwest,KwaZulu-Natal,Emeryville...
Mum and two grown up daughters spending few days in Cape Town and then planning to drive to Mossel Bay. Is driving recommended and what should we be wary of? And any recommendations of car hire companies  Thanks ,elaineDevon,Cape Town Central,devon
Hi everyone    I am going to SA on my honeymoon in March and we are planning on driving from the Drakensberg (around Royal Natal) to Hoedspruit over 2 days (stopping in Graskop on night 1 and then doing the Panorama Route the next day). I have read a bit about recent protests and road conditions generally and curious how much I should be worried about them.    Our route would take highways 74 - 3 - 103 - 34 - 546 - 39 - 36 - 539 - 532. Just following Google here.    Does anyone think that this drive would not be possible or that protests or road conditions are likely to cause delays or that this is a dangerous idea? Any recommendations / thoughts would be appreciated.    Thanks!  Marie-Soleil    Thank you  Matt ,Marie-Soleil P,,"Montreal, Canada"

Hello travel community. please may i have some advice. our family of 3 adults is travelling to KZN from 4-11 april. we're hoping to rent a car at king shaka airport and drive down to st lucia for 2 days prior to doing the 4 day wilderness trail which starts at Mpila. I'm wondering about transport to mpila and then back to king shaka airport. is it a good idea to give back our rental car in st lucia and use shuttle/uber to mpila and then back to king shaka airport after the trail? it seems a pity to pay for 4 days car hire when we are hiking. I'd appreciate any wisdom! ,Farzana M,St Lucia,"Cape Town, Western..."

Hi I have a trip to Western Cape soon including a few days in Cape Town. I wonder whether there are recommended locations for cash withdrawals from ATM (using overseas cards) which are safer / less likely to be robbed? Of course the general precaution of making sure not being followed be wary of strangers offering help etc. apply but I suppose certain locations might be more risky?    On the other hand are there any ATM operators which do not charge ATM cash withdrawal fees or are recommended for cheaper fees for cards issued overseas? I am referring to fees on top of those charged by my card issuer.    Thanks for any tips / comments! ,BillyFCC,Cape Town,Newcastle upon...
Hi guys were heading to SA in 3 weeks time and want to get SIM cards at the airport. Ive read you need your poassport and proof of accomodation to get a travel sim. But were staying at my wife’s cousins house in Johburg for 3 days then her parents house in Kimberley for a week then her brothers in East London for a few days before heading to PE. So our first proof of accomodation is in PE 10 days later or Cape Town 3 weeks later. Will we have any problems with this? We all have Australian passports so will that new proof enough were travelling? ,Troy P,,"Melbourne, Australia"
Hi  I value this site so much. Thank you in advance for any info provided  I am planning a holiday for my family 2 adults and 3 children ages: 171510.  I am trying to fit Krugar/Panoramic Route Drakensberg and Garden Route (Port Elisabeth to Cape Town into 19 days.  I was thinking:  1 day Johannesburg- sleeping off jet leg  4 day tour of Kruger and Panoramic Route  5 days in Drakensberg to see mountains hike and a tour up to Sani Pass  7 days Garden Route (flying Durban to Port Elizabeth) and sleeping in:  Tsitsikamma Wilderness/ Krysna and Hermanus (thinking this part would be self-drive for sure).  2 days Cape Town    My questions are:  1. Does this look crazy? Alternatively I drop Krugar and just have more time in KZN and do a safari there. I keep hearing 'you can't go to South Africa and not go to Krugar!' and am trying hard to make it work.  2. Is there a way to go from Krugar to Drakensberg area without having to drive all the way back to Johannesburg and then fly to Durban? I don't think we are up for self- drive out of Joburg but possibly we could get a car rental at Krugar and self-drive to Drakensberg area?  3. Is self drive around Drakensberg and Sani Pass considered safe? And is it a picturesque drive? Driving can be quire stressful in a foreign country so hence was thinking of flying and looking for a tour guide.  4. Do the stops I've chosen for the Garden Route seem reasonable?  5. Is Cape Aghulas worthy of a stop on an itinerary this packed or just have extra hours in Cape Town.  If anyone has any input I'm grateful! Or recommendations on a travel company that could put this sort of trip together for me would be great too.  Thank you! ,Cristi M,,North Ward...

I wanted to make sure I haven’t made a huge mistake as I’m a little confused about the drive times in Kruger gates vs parks.    So I am staying at lower Sabie. My understanding is that this isn’t that far from SKUKUZA. I have a flight booked at 11:40am from that airport.    I need to drop the car off at the Avis car rental place and get the plane.    Is this a fairly doable thing or am I underestimating how long all this will take? You can start driving at 4.30am in the park I believe? and I’m guessing I’d need to leave lower Sabie at 6.30am to get to drop car off and get to airport? ,Karl,,"London, United..."
Please humor me because this question is going to show my complete ignorance of international rugby. I'm not much of a fan of American sports let alone international ones but my son is. We will be in Cape Town from Aug 21 - 29 and he would love to attend a game (or is it called a match?) while we are there.    I do know that the SA national team are the Springboks but it doesn't look like they will be playing in Cape Town during that time. But the way schedules (fixtures?) are listed is very different than here in the U.S. so I could be wrong about that!    Are there other teams that might be playing Cape Town? Perhaps a lower-level pro team or even an amateur team that might be similar to a U.S. college team? He isn't picky and would just like to watch some live rugby since we rarely get that opportunity in the U.S.    Like i said please forgive my complete lack of knowledge of rugby! ,Michelle L,Cape Town,"Middleton, Wisconsin"

Hello - I am just starting the process to plan a trip to Africa next year. I’ve been comparing countries but I would really love to hear from other travelers which country you would recommend visiting first. I feel like South Africa and Tanzania look like good places to start but there are so many countries that look like they offer such great experiences!    I definitely want to go on safari and I would love to book a private lodge/reserve where the driver can go anywhere. I would also love to find a place where elephants frequent. Do you guys have any recommendations that you loved? ,Katie,,"Omaha, Nebraska"
I am wondering why most people mention visiting the Blyde Canyon from the BC Forever Resort and around rather from the other side (Blyde Canyon lodge Umvaganti).

Therefore I am not too keen to stay at the Forever resort giving its mixed reviews.    Cold you please help ? ,Chantal L,Mpumalanga,Lausanne...
Sensitive question:  We are considering a multi-generational trip to Johannesburg Sun City and Pilanesberg NP.  One family member that is older and in pretty good shape otherwise is a bit worried about the game drives/safaris primary the lack of toilet facilities. Bouncing around in a vehicle can exacerbate their need to 'go' so a 2-3 hour tour with no stops is concerning. I assume that stopping and going behind a bush is 1. dangerous and 2. not an option for other reasons. Wondering if staying in the park at one of the lodges would be a better option than a day trip from Sun City?    - Can you see wildlife from any of the lodges in the park?  - Do the am and pm drives from the lodges make comfort stops part-way through their 2-3 hr drives?    The person in question doesn't want to miss out but considering idea of wearing DEPENDS is embarrassing to them they are thinking about skipping this part of the trip. I'd like everyone to feel good and share experiences so any help you can provide is most appreciated. This is a bucket list trip for a different member of our family that may not make future trips. Staying at a lodge in park is the only thing I can come up with that might mitigate this problem.    Pls help. ,dawn j,Pilanesberg National Park,"Alexandria, Virginia"

Hi! We will be traveling from OR Tambo Airport to Graskop next week and will need to do some groceries in the first hour or so.

We are particularly looking for a supermarket that (1) is in a safe area (2) carries a good selection of gluten free products and (3) that might sell portable coolers that are inexpensive (we won't be able to take it home with us).

We will be spending our last days in SA in Drakensberg coming from Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park. We would like to do some day hikes and maybe drive the Sani Pass we will be there over the Easter weekend. What is the best base to do some day hikes in Drakensberg? We have a 4x4 rented car is it worth it to drive the Sani pass? And is the best place to stay to start the Sani pass Underberg? What are nice accommodations in Underberg?  I am not sure if I should choose Giants Castle or Didima or Cathedral Peak as a base for day hikes in Drakensberg. Or should I go for Natal and do the Tugela gorge walk....  Or should I stay one night in Underberg two nights in Giants Castle or Didima and a third night in Natal before driving back to Joburg?

We are traveling to South Africa in early June of this year. We are all adults-but we are bringing our elderly parents (older but adventurous and young at heart) but not physically able to do extensive hiking. Currently we are leaving Johannesburg at 10amish and traveling to Howick where we will stay the evening. The next morning we are planning on going on a ziplining tour after which we will be traveling to coast to check out the ocean-truly will be a very short pit stop for lunch. Our current plans is to get to Vryheid that evening for an overnight stay. We will sleep in and make a late morning start to Marloth Park arriving there prior to nightfall.    Here are my questions:  1. Will we have a scenic enough trip on the road from Johannesburg to Howick to Durban?  2. Should we add another day in Howick and if so any recommendations for items to see which would not require a major hike?  3. Would it be more beneficial to adjust our travel plans to see more of this area and skip the Panorama Trail area-which is our plan after KNP? We went there a few years (minus the elderly parents) and enjoyed it enough-particularly seeing some of the local vendor markets and Blyde Canyon. We will be in South Africa for 2 weeks and have set aside 6 Nights in the KNP area.    Thanks in advance for any assistance with the above questions. Just want to make the most informed decisions for our trip. ,Audjoc,KwaZulu-Natal,"Beijing, China"

All other afternoon flights were full otherwise I would have been able to have more time.

Hi    After advice please my husband and I are looking to travel to South Africa next year for my husbands 50th birthday. We want to have a few nights in Cape town probably 4 nights then rent a car and do the Garden Route followed by a Safari before flying back home. our budget is about £4000 each so a total of £8000 the travel agent advised to budget for a figure of around £11000. Is it better to book the whole trip through a travel agent or book everything individually as looking on booking .com some of the hotels are coming out a very reasonable price. Also wanted to ask what the driving is like from Cape town through the Garden Route? is it safe as have heard mixed reports so just a little unsure. can anyone give advise on a safari I know this will be the most expensive part of the trip. Have been given some advise to drive along the garden route drop our car at port elizabeth to then fly closer to the game reserves. Is a private reserve better? I know nothing about the Safari side of things as there seems to be soooo many options.  Sorry for all the questions but trying to do some homework well in advance of booking this trip and have soooo many things going round my head.    Sorry one last question best place to stay in Cape town have been advised of Greenpoint.    Many thanks in advance.    Ashley ,asherguernsey,,"Guernsey, United..."
Hi guys    Later this week I'm taking a side trip to Namibia to go on safari in Etosha national park and to see Swakopmund. I'll be in Namibia for 5 days and will return to South Africa at the end of that trip for three days before I fly back to the US. I know American citizens (among others) are allowed a 90 day visa free stay in South Africa but I wanted to verify that my understanding was correct that (American) travellers can exit and re-enter South Africa at will within that 90 day period? Currently my 90 day period expires in June. Thus I shouldn't have any issues re-entering SA after a stop in Namibia since I'm within my 90 days correct?    Also I wanted to give an update regarding my current trip. Before my trip I was super concerned about crime in SA and wondered if I was being foolish visiting. After being here for several weeks I think my fear was largely unnecessary and I wanted to generally comment on safety in the country in case there's someone out there who's stressing about their trip like I was. Take this with a grain of salt as my trip has been confined to Western Cape but my experience has been overwhelming positive. South Africa is a beautiful and fascinating country full of really wonderful and friendly people. All of the South Africans I've met have been helpful and I enjoy all of the little chats that happen through out the day. The overseas press paints a bleak picture of the crime and safety situation here and though there's some factual basis to that I don't think it tells the full story. Whilst I've been here I've never really felt unsafe. I've seen some shady characters but not anymore than I normally see at home or in a big international city.  I feel safe walking around the tourist sites and driving from place to place even in downtown Cape Town.  People generally seem to go about their business same as they do in the States. South Africa is NOT a war zone or a failed state like some news articles will lead you to believe. Knock on wood my trip has been very enjoyable and incident free thus far.    That being said I've seen it previously mentioned on this site and others that SA requires more caution and vigilance than some other destinations and I wanted to echo that sentiment. Most tourists who come to SA seem to have a great and safe time but you need to look out. I'd definitely follow all the safety precautions that have been repeated ad nauseam; take them seriously. I also think it's a good idea to be home at least by night fall; I haven't necessarily felt unsafe at night but I've noticed more shady folks start to come out after dark. I think trip planning with safety in mind is also important; know where you're going if there's anything to watch out for if you should get a guide (EG hiking Table Mountain) and if there's any rough spots on your route to get there. Ditto for researching the area where your accomodation is; SA is very affordable so stay in an area with a good safety reputation. Being friendly and talking to the locals is also huge; most South Africans are super friendly and have no qualms giving safety advice to tourists about an area. I also feel that South Africans go out of there way to look after tourists since tourism is such a big part of the economy.    TLDR; I can't recommend South Africa enough it's wonderful and you shouldn't be fearful of visiting. Most places tourists go are safe and the people are amazing...but you need to be vigilant. No need to be paranoid but always keep safety in mind and go the extra mile to avoid being in a bad spot. An ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure. ,namelessnewman,Cape Town,

Hello we are 8 adults planning a trip to Capetown Kruger and Okavango Delta in October 2024.    We are torn between these two lodges Chitwa chitwa and Londolozzi Varty. Someone has said that the services and food at Chitwa Chitwa has declined. Has anyone heard about this.    We are all adults and would enjoy a calm relaxing stay with lots of wild life viewing and would love to lounge around in the main area or in a pool while waiting for the day to pass. Any recommendations or current information is greatly appreciated.

Hi all  We'd like to visit the Cradle of Humankind while in Johannesburg. Would you recommend an organized tour or self drive? We will be staying near the airport so getting a car for the day should not be too difficult. The tours include about an hour at the Sterkfontein Caves and then time at Maropeng visitor center. Safe to drive in this area? Reviews make me think the tours could be strictly transportation and not heavy on information. Thoughts? ,Kim B,Johannesburg,
Admittedly I should’ve done more research about rainy season safaris.    We are headed to Kruger today for a week and weather shows pretty much five days of nonstop rain. I’m exceptionally disappointed and need some advice about how you’ve dealt with this kind of situation.    My idea of swimming and relaxing in the afternoon in between drives is obviously out the window. Great viewing conditions with rain and very tall grasses after recent rains out the window. Mentally I’m trying to figure out how to get a better attitude about this. If the two lodges could be rescheduled or cancelled I would cancel. but they’re not.    If any of you were on a completely washed out safari how did you find enjoyment? Thanks for your input.    Lana ,Lana G,,Massachusetts
Hello I appreciate your time. We are arriving in Cape Town in 5 weeks time - can’t wait! We have 3 children (5 10 12). We think we have completed our itinerary but I would appreciate any feedback or advice so we can make any tweaks before we arrive.    Land in Cape Town - staying for 2 nights on the V&A waterfront - we haven’t booked anything but weather dependent would like to visit table mountain and go up and have lunch visit boulders beach and cheetah outreach.    Drive to Oudtshoorn - staying on an Ostrich Farm for 1 night. We will probably go to Congo caves before/day after. Possibly Congo wildlife ranch.    Drive to Knysna - staying for 2 nights on Stanley Island. We have booked a snorkel with seals excursion and plan to visit monkeyland and birds of Eden. Will head to Knysna heads too.    Check out early and drive to Storms River - we have kayaking booked.    Drive to Shamwari Game reserve - 3 nights.    Fly Port Elizabeth to CT where we have 1 night and a day to complete any activities we may not have done at the beginning.    My only concern now is the drive from CT to Oudtshoorn- I know it’s 4-5 hours. I feel the most scenic drive would be towards Mossell Bay and then up… I’m wondering if we needed a stop off before… we are going to break the journey up but looking at google maps I’m not sure where to stop? I’m wondering if we head along the main route towards mossel bay with a couple of stops and then head up to Oudtshoorn?    Considering we are a family we are wanting stops that are fun and safe for the children - we like walking etc but not lengthily or challenging hikes.

Hello we are thinking of visiting Stellenbosch next January but would like to understand the practical implications of “load shedding” on the trip.

Hi  I am looking to book a 3 day safari next Jan for myself and a friend.  We will travelling from Cape Town touring the Wine region and doing the garden route. We want to spend our last 3 days somewhere in the Eastern Cape.  We are looking for recommendation for nice authentic places to stay to get the safari experience.  Ideally we would like somewhere that does the games drives and provides meals etc.  We don't have a massive budget and were looking to spend about £500 each for 3 nights safari.  The places I have looked at so far are either miles away from Addo or really expensive.  Any recommendations? It doesn't have to be Addo as long as its easy enough to get to.  Thank you ,N74C,Addo Elephant National Park,"London, United..."

Greetings. I am interested in feedback concerning the lounges at O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg South Africa. Here are my facts. On the day that I will be flying back to the USA I will arrive at O.R. Tambo from the Hoedspruit airport at 3:25 p.m. (via Airlink) and that same day I will depart from O.R. Tambo for the USA at 10:55 p.m. (via Delta Airlines). I do not plan to check any bags for either flight. I am assuming my Airlink flight will land at Terminal B (domestic). So I will need to transfer to Terminal A (international). I am considering various options for what to do with the 7.5 hours between flights including just staying at the airport and possibly spending some time in a lounge or two. I have done a little bit of research regarding the lounges at O.R. Tambo. It appears that the ORT Sky Lounge at Terminal B has a 2-hour time limit and the Shongololo Premium Lounge at Terminal A has a 4-hour time limit. So I am considering spending up to two hours in the ORT Sky Lounge and then going to Terminal A (which is where I am assuming I will then go through customs) and then spend a few hours in the Shongololo Premium Lounge. I would book both lounges in advance online. Does anyone see any problem with this option or have any better suggestions? My trip is still a few months away but I would like to come up with a viable plan or two. Thanks very much! ,JulieB,,
We are considering to stay 4 nights at Vuyani River Lodge. Does anybody has experience regarding game viewing at Blue-Canyon Private Game Reserve? ,JuliusH,,
Are safety issues more or less at either location?    We’ll be arriving in the morning and leaving the next morning for Phinda. We need to stay overnight as a same day connection would be cutting it too close.    We’ve stayed at Melrose Arch several times and are familiar with what it is but a third party has alerted our friends that that the trip to Melrose Arch would be unsafe. We’ve been fine with it when we’ve traveled in the past but have conditions changed? ,troggs,Johannesburg,"Louisville, Kentucky"

So I’m planning on booking a Qatar business ticket from Skukuza to Iah. I know the Airlink flight from sku to cpt doesn’t have business class or first (whenever I book online it says I’ll be in first class not sure why)  the Qatar flights would be qsuite. Has anyone had experience booking this on one ticket through Qatar airways website directly and how big of an headache this potentially might be? Also if one ticket do I need to get bags at CPT and recheck them cause I have to do immigration again. ,Pujan P,,

We are in the initial planning stages for a 2 week trip to Kruger ideally August-October avoiding the school holidays which I believe are late September early October. The plan would be to end our time in Sabi Sands at either Silvan lodge or Dulini.    We’ve been to Kruger once before (September 2016) self-driving in Kruger for around 2 ½ days and 3 nights at Pondoro game lodge in Balule. We were blown away by the amount and variety of game that we say on our self drives. Pondoro was amazing and we were impressed by our guide and tracker who managed to find us some incredible sightings. Our only niggle was the obsession with ‘the big five’ but this seems to be the case for most lodges.    Our questions are does anyone have experience of both Silvan Dulini and if so which of the two do you consider having the better safari experience?  With Dulini I’m struggling to choose between the three lodges as they all look so beautiful I’m currently edging towards River and Moya. For those who know the lodges do you think we would have a better experience staying at one lodge for 4 nights or is it worth splitting our time between 2 lodges probably staying at one for 2 nights and the other for 2 or 3?    Thanks in advance for any advice. ,Paul S,Kruger National Park,

Hi  I got married on the weekend and unlike most Grooms i was heavily involved in the planning so havent even taken a look at planning our honeymoon. We are going to do Cape town and then fly up to Johannesburg landing on the 4th or 5th of april (yes in 4 weeks). It has to be these dates as i am a teacher. If we need to fly elsewhere we are obviously happy too. I will cut to the chase apologies.    Can anyone suggest any lodges for couples with a budget at £500 a night between the two? I have looked at a few suggestions on the forum but many sold out. If people could list some suggestions i will troll through them and find out if they have any space at short notice. We were hoping to do 3 or 4 nights and stay in the nicest place we can afford with good game viewing.    Kapama riverlodge is the only one i have found during my short search so far.    thanks    Josh ,Joshua B,Kruger National Park,"Dubai, United Arab..."
Hello  Would appreciate information on something I am unsure about.    We arrive from Victoria Falls at 3.10pm and then fly home to UK the same day on BA departing 7.20pm so roughly four hours later.  Flights were booked separately so not on a through ticket.    Presumably provided flight from VF is not significantly delayed there will be plenty of time to catch the UK flight in the evening? What is the procedure though at the airport as I have never done this before? Do we collect our baggage go through passport control and exit the arrivals and then look for departures so we can check in for the next flight? I guess that’s what I have assumed we’ll do but is there a short cut in this situation?    Also does the VF flight arrive in the same terminal from which BA departs?    Thank you. ,sim0np,Johannesburg,"Cuffley, United..."

Hi    My wife and I are planning our honeymoon in South Africa in late October of this year. We will start with 4 nights of safari at an &Beyond lodge followed by 3 nights in Cape Town. I have done quite a lot of research regarding where to stay in Cape Town and am having difficulty deciding between staying at the large established and pricey resorts (Mount Nelson / One&Only) or more boutique hotels (Labotessa NOAH House).    Mount Nelson: £2717  One&Only: £2115  Labotessa: £1303  NOAH House: £820    I'm hoping to get people's opinions on whether a stay at either Mount Nelson or One&Only are worth the fairly large step up in cost? We can afford the more expensive ones but I would hate to pay c. £2k for a negligible difference.    Appreciate this can be quite subjective but would love to hear people's experiences and advice if they have any. If it helps we will probably be looking for a pretty relaxed few days spent eating good food sunning ourselves (weather and facilities permitting) and going out for drinks in the evening.    Many thanks! ,KZHassan,Cape Town,

I am stuck. Kwazulu Natal. An unknown part of South Africa for us.  And also so much to see and do.  We want to travel June next year. Some locations are a must because my husband is (hopefully) going to run the Comrades Marathon.    The itinerary I currently have is:  Day 1 Arr. Johannesburg late evening overnight City Lodge  Day 2 Johannesburg - Pietermaritzburg  Day 3-6 Stay in Pietermaritzburg  Day 7 Pietermaritzburg - Hluhluwe (Hilltop)  Day 8 Hilltop  Day 9 Hilltop  Day 10 Hilltop - Mpila  Day 11 Mpila  Day 12 Mpila - Cape Vidal or St Lucia or ?  Day 13 Cape Vidal or St Lucia or ?  Day 14 Cape Vidal or St Lucia or ?  Day 15 Cape Vidal or St Lucia or ?  Day 16 drive to Tembe Elephant Park  Day 17 Tembe  Day 18 Tembe  Day 19 Tembe - Piet Retief  Day 20 Piet Retief - Johannesburg OR Tambo flight leaves late at night    Questions to fellow travellers:  So the Pietermaritzburg part is needed although open to suggestions for nice accommodation  For the Hluhluwe part is 3 nights Hilltop and 2 nights Mpila okay too much or more needed    Then my biggest problem. 4 nights Cape Vidal might be too much. And I am also not sure of Cape Vidal. So any suggestions on this part are very much welcome. I am leaning now towards 2 nights St Lucia itself and 2 nights Sodwana. But we are open for suggestions.  We love wildlife and that's what we want to see.    Tembe is also something I do want to keep. But open to suggestions.    I know it is a lot of questions but hopefully some KZN fans can give me some advice.  For your info we have been to Etosha Chobe Kgalagadi & Kruger in previous years.    Thanks in advance!

Hi! I'm planning a Garden Route trip with my partner up until Storms River in April and am trying to figure out the best way to get around without renting our own car. I looked into Baz Bus but this takes too long for us to get from point A to point B. I tried to find out if it would be possible to use Uber or Bolt but the app blocks every time I put in the trip from Cape Town to Wilderness. it seems to me they don't do long trips. It makes me wonder what would be best. The itinerary would be like this:    Cape Town - Wilderness (1 night) - Knysna (1 night) - Plettenberg Bay (2 nights) - Storms River (2 nights) - Mossel Bay (1 night) Hermanus (1 night) - Cape Town    Does anyone have any more intel on the Uber situation or any other suggestions? I also looked into flying into George and then do the first part of our trip from there to come back via Mossel Bay and Hermanus.    Thank you for any information!

Good evening    We are currently planning our honeymoon for May/June this year and according to our budget we are looking for a 3 night stay at either:    Nottens bush camp    Elephant Plains    Arathusa Safari Lodge    If there are any experts who know the lodges well please could you recommend which one you would pick?    Is there anywhere you can see which areas you are allowed to go into from each lodge on game drives?

Hi    My family of five (two adults and three kids age 17 15 and 10 ) are traveling to South Africa for a very long anticipated holiday end November for 18 days from Australia. We fly into Johannesburg and out of Capetown. I am having deciding on the best option for our itinerary and also finding places to accommodate the 5 of us together.    The two options to start our trip I am looking at are either:    1) Taking an organized family Kruger/Panoramic Route tour from Johannesburg for 4- 5 days. (I think this sounds like an easy option but my husband hates crowds and wonder what it will be like that time of year). I like the idea of having a tour guide to provide us insight and direction/education along the way. Kurt's Family Safari's looked like a great option that allows children and caters to family's. The sites along the Panoramic Route look to amazing and potentially a lot of fun for my family.    2) The other option is for us is to miss Kruger and instead fly onto Durban when we arrive and self-drive the Drakensberg area (perhaps staying at Cathedral Peak Hotel or Champagne Castle Resort-wherever the best family accommodation is found). We love mountains and day hikes. If we did this I was looking at doing a safari experience in Ndaka for two nights where they have two-room tents for family's ( and seem to get wonderful reviews from all who stay there) and then doing a Sani Pass tour. We have South African friends from the Drakensberg area and they rave about the area's beauty.    We would then fly from Johannesburg (option 1) or Durban (option 2) to Port Elizabeth and drive the Garden Route to Cape Town (probably staying in Air BnB's since accommodation seems limited for 5 people together). Depending on which option I take I'll have about 6-7 days to do the Garden Route and then three days in Cape Town before we leave again for Australia. I was thinking of staying in Storms River and then Wilderness or Knysna on our way to Cape Town.    When I ask South African friends about the options above they say to do both! I am renown for packing too much into our holiday and am trying to avoid this while still getting to experience different areas.    We are looking for comfortable / clean but not fancy accommodation. I don't think we will need more than 2 days on safari. We have never been on a safari and will be thrilled by seeing any/ all animals (not any one in particular). I just want to ensure whatever we do does not feel like we are following one crowd from one sight-seeing spot to another. We hope to do some zip-line canyoning kayak-type bungee hiking swimming activities (anywhere we all love adventure) along the Garden-Route I am hoping to work around a total budget of about $10-12000 (AUD) for this trip.    Any input on family travel for me or any reaction to the above itinerary would be greatly appreciated! ,Cristi M,,North Ward...

Hello! Concerned about SAFETY first and foremost in light of the load-shedding situation. Anyone been there recently and can comment? IS CAPE TOWN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF LOAD-SHEDDING / POST-COVID?    I'm an American who used to live in Johannesburg from 2009 - 2012 and I've routinely traveled back to South Africa even whilst pregnant and with my young children!!! The last time we were there was January of 2020 and we had a great time. HOWEVER before each time I travel there I'm ALWAYS WORRIED about crime. Like REALLY WORRIED. I suspect this has been especially since I've had kids. But I ALSO KNOW that each time I'm there I feel a level of freedom and joy and bliss that I just don't get at home. South Africa is truly a wonderful place.    I'm scheduled to travel there from March 11 - 23rd and stay in Constantia (she has an INVERTER) go to Pringle Bay and go to Franschoek. I suppose NOW I'm EXTRA WORRIED about this trip. My husband has never lived in South Africa and although I've TOLD HIM about the power cuts he's not worried (but I also think he's not grasping the severity of the situation).    Again main concern is that POWER CUTS = CRIME  POST-COVID ECONOMY = CRIME  POWER CUTS = Dirty water and unsanitary conditions = ILLNESS (On our 2018 trip with the drought I caught a TERRIBLE Tummy Bug)    I want to make sure I'm not sending my kids into a potentially terrifying or ACTUALLY DANGEROUS situation.

Hi    I am looking for some advice on a 3 week itinerary for May this year. We arrive into Cape Town on 14th May and are planning to spend approximately 1 week in the Cape town area as well as the winelands. After this we have two options:    1. Drive the Garden Route for approximately 1 week and then fly from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg do 1 week in the Kruger / Panorama Route area before flying home    2. Fly from Cape Town to Johannesburg do 1 week in the Kruger / Panorama Route area before traveling back to Johannesburg and flying to Mauritius for 1 week before flying home    For those who have travelled to both the Garden Route and Mauritius which is your preference? What will the weather be like in both regions in mid-end May? We enjoy relaxing in the sun swimming in the sea but also visiting beautiful landscapes and doing some gentle hikes.    Do you think it is a better shout to just stick in South Africa during this time or would spending our final week in Mauritius be a nice contrast?    Thanks in advance for any tips! ,Simon G,,County Dublin...

Thought I'd share my 1st experience of Cape Town in the hope that it's helpful to others:    We landed at 8:30am Sunday morning and after a quick change and freshen-up at our guest we got on the hop on-off bus in Camps Bay - 1.5 hrs later we got off at Constantia Nek did some wine tasting at Beau Constantia and then an awesome lunch next door at Chefs Warehouse. Then an uber to The Marley in Camps Bay for a massage. We were fast asleep in bed by 8:45pm!    Yesterday we woke up to torrential rain so had to quickly adjust our plans! After breakfast we got an uber to the District Six Museum for a look around and a tour from an ex-resident. Then an uber to The Silo hotel for cocktails and lunch. We went visited The Watershed the 2 oceans aquarium The Diamond Museum. Then a cocktail at Cause Effect Cocktail Bar and drinks at Mitchell's next door before dinner at Tigers Milk. Then an uber back to our guesthouse and fast asleep by 11pm!    Everything so far has been amazing - superb quality - excellent value - everyone is so friendly - feels safe and secure - no issues with load-shedding - and this morning the sun is shining!    Super excited today to be doing Table Mountain lunch at Constantia Glen and the botanical gardens today and then the theatre tonight. Bring it on! ,Paul S,Cape Town,"Norwich, United..."

Bought a MTN prepaid SIM Card at Cape Town airport in November 2022 because they had cheaper offers than Vodacom and better offers for 30 days. Buying and instantly activating the SIM was an easy process at the MTN airport shop. For Cape Town the MTN SIM worked well for me. But for the Garden Route my experience was mixed. E.g. if there was loadshedding in Wilderness there was no internet with MTN because they obviously have no backup power. I had loadshedding in November / December up to stage 6 that means about 7.5 hours without power and internet. Of course you can survive without internet but if you have to do / change online bookings it can be a problem. Other problem with MTN is that their data tariffs are difficult to understand. If you buy a data package you should always ask if you can use the GB every time. They seem to have offers where you can use half the GB only between midnight and 05:00 a.m. or only for youtube or other things. When you check your remaining data it isn't transparent when the remaining data is valid. So e.g. you think you have 1.5 GB data left and suddenly your data is empty because 1GB is only valid at nighttime. Another annoying thing is that you get a lot of ads for other packages (daily) and phone calls from people you don't know. I have no experience with a VODACOM SIM but e.g. for Wilderness they seem to have internet during loadshedding as I saw people using it. ,Engl E,,

Hello  We are making a self drive trip from March 31 till April 10 2023 flying in and out of Joburg.  I have been roughly planning my itinerary and it looks more or less as follows:    Day 1: Land in Joburg on March 31st and rent a 4x4 car and drive to Drakensberg  Day 2: hiking in Drakensberg  Day 3: drive the Sani pass  Day 4: Drive to Saint Lucia  Day 5: Hluhluwe-Imfolozipark  Day 6: iSimangaliso wetland park  Day 7: Drive to Kruger park  Day 8: Self drive Kruger park  Day 9: Self drive Kruger park  Day 10: Drive to Joburg and take evening flight back home    Does this looks doable? Any ideas on the destinations? Is the Sani Pass open early April?    This itinerary has three major destinations and we stay three nights in each. We love safari nature and hiking and always plan out our own travels.    Another question I have: I realise we are travelling during school holidays and the last weekend is Easter weekend. Is it better to spend Easter weekend in Drakensberg or in Kruger in terms of it being busy with local vacationers. Where will it be busiest during Easter weekend: Kruger of Drakensberg. Any other reasons why I should stay in the one or the other during that weekend? ( I can reverse the order of our trip and start with Kruger park and end in Drakensberg.)    Also I have one more day that I have to add somewhere should I maybe add a day between Saint Lucia and Kruger and if so where should I make an overnight stop between those two?    And if we drive from Saint Lucia to Kruger ( or from Kruger to Saint Lucia) which route should we take? And can it be done in one days drive?    Any tips on accommodations? Budget to mid range does not have to be luxurious but like an ensuite bathroom and I love something authentic and in nature.    Do we need to take preventative drugs against malaria for this itinerary in this season?    What is a good rental car company at the airport of Johannesburg for 4x4 car.    What are the best areas in Kruger for self drive safari?    A lot of questions all tips and answers are welcome and appreciated.    Thank you! ,Veerle V.,,"Bruges, Belgium"
Hello    Thanks in advance but just wanted to see if anyone could check our 6-night Kruger itinerary for my wife and me.    We fly into Or Tambo on 15 March 10 pm pick up a rental car and sleep near the airport then drive through early morning on 16th march to Isambane camp. Do you think we can do some of the panorama route before 4 pm we would like to do the first game at that time in Isambane.    We will be there for 2 nights. Then we go to Hoyo Hoyo for 2 nights more.    Then we go to Elephant plains because Hoyo Hoyo has no longer room but the question is how to do this transfer? I think is close but not sure how to do it.    Elephant plains check-out is on 21st March at 11 am is there a way to have a private safari to KNP from here all day?    Then we are planning to sleep that day in Hazyview or any other recommendations? our intent is to visit Chimps Eden on the 22nd which is our last day in SA. Or flight departs at 11:50 pm at Or Tambo.    Does this all make sense in terms of drive times and diversity games? I imagine there is no option rather than renting a car right? I don't want to but if is necessary I will do it.    Sorry if the itinerary has so many stops but I wanted to fulfill my wife's request.    All feedback is much appreciated! Thank you very much! ,Luis I,Kruger National Park,Bowling Green...

Hi all - my wife and I are so excited for our upcoming trip to South Africa/Botswana/Victoria Falls. We are traveling with a group of friends from Seattle Washington USA and the core of the trip is set as follows. We are traveling in late June.  4 days Cape Town  Fly to Botswana and spend 7 total days on 2 safari’s  Fly to Victoria Falls and spend 2 nights  We would likely ultimately fly out of Johannesburg.  We are thinking of adding a few days onto the front end of the trip or back end of the trip or both. Would love to hear some suggestions for either pre or post core trip. Thanks so much! ,Joseph T,Cape Town,"Seattle, Washington"
Planning on hiring a car in Cape Town and driving to Boulders Beach via Chapman’s Peak toll road. Then driving via Muizenberg along the R310 eventually arriving in Franschoek.  I want to do this in one day. It looks OK on ‘Google maps’ but I have seen a post saying the Google timings for routes are way off.  I would be interested to know from anyone with local knowledge if you think I am being too ambitious.  We are staying in Camps Bay and could maybe get the car delivered to our B&B? ,Alison Denison,Cape Town,

I have checked and rechecked car rentals obsessively for weeks. The information in the forum is scant. I have also checked with a SA friend who visits Cape Town too. His suggestions were different I just want a reliable affordable car rental agency who doesn't try to rip off customers. Being from the US it is hard to know what is best.

Hi I am due to arrive into JNB early morning and would like to get to Wanderers Taxi Rank as early as possible to get a van to Mbabane Eswatini.

I started reserving accommodation for our upcoming trip to SA much in advance and witnessed very strange behaviour from a couple of hosts. The one with whom we have already booked directly (without any prepayment) made us wait for 3 months before replying to my subsequent email concerning details of our stay…. I thought that maybe she has changed her mind and did not want to host us any more and I booked another accommodation in the meanwhile…but yesterday right out of the blue she replied (after 3 months of silence) as if nothing’s happened… not even an excuse. It is so weird and I do not know what to make of it…The other lady was much quicker… it took her “only” 2 months to let me know if the price suited her (and it did suit her). Very weird… and since it happened twice… with two different persons… I wonder if it might be a national habit? Would you trust such a person? Is it common in SA to behave like this? ,gospodi,,Hungary

Hi all  For various reasons we are very late booking this but also v excited to be coming to South Africa this weekend!  We’ve decided to drive from JNB to St Lucia and wondered if you could recommend any game reserves on the way please? I’ve contacted all of the Nambiti lodges but doesn’t look like there is much availability ( unsurprisingly I guess!). We can either do 11-12 feb or 16-17 feb and our budget doesn’t stretch to high end! Does anybody have any other suggestions please? We’re also hoping to do cape Vidal and hluhluwe while in St Lucia. Or is a different option to book with an operator there? Thanks so  Much ,bruisyard,Greater Johannesburg,United Kingdom

Hi- I'm planning my visit to Cape Town in mid-May. Of course while there I would like to go to Robben Island but...    I'm starting to read no small number of stories of people getting sick on the ferry. I am just thinking back to my experience going to the Great Barrier Reef when I got REALLY sick no fun! I took motion sickness medicine ate breakfast had ginger chews did everything I was supposed to and yet still... I was told pertaining to there there are some days that are just rough like that and even with all the precautions you may just end up getting sick.    So those with experience riding on the ferry to Robben Island how worried do you think I should be? I would hate to miss out by chickening out of it but on the other hand the thought of repeating my experience with the Great Barrier Reef makes me queasy.    Appreciate any thoughts- thank you!    ~Adam ,Adam G,Cape Town,"Cleveland, Ohio"

All    Looking for your feedback as I build a one month *relaxed* itinerary in South Africa. This will be my 15 year anniversary with my wife and we're bringing our 4 children along (ages from 10 months to 10 years old). We love to be in nature but will have to be temper expectations of crazy hikes with the little ones in tow. Also relaxed is a key word - we have ample time and don't care to pack every day with activities and long arduous drives.    Here's what I have so far (visiting from late July to late August 2023). I haven't reserved anything yet so trip is totally flexible. Welcome your feedback on sequence accommodations must do activities durations anything!    Part 1  Fly into Cape Town and rent a van  Reside in an airbnb in Camps Bay for 8 days  Check out Table Mountain Cape Peninsula Kirstenbosch Garden Hermanus whale watching    Part 2  Drive towards Plettenberg Bay  Reside in an airbnb in Plettenberg Bay for 78days  Check out attractions within the Garden Route Tsitsikamma National Park maybe Addo Elephant though a bit far    Part 3  Leave van and fly from George Airport to Kruger Mpumalanga Airport (connecting in Johannesburg) and rent another van  Stay somewhere (Hazyview Sabie Graskop Ohrigstad other?) for 8 days  Check out Kruger and Panorama Route    Part 4  Drive to Drakensberg Mountain (~7hr long drive!!)  Check out the North Drakensberg mountains Lesotho and maybe a 4x4 guided Sani Pass tour  Stay near the north mountains for 5 days    Part 5  Drive to Johannesburg  Reside in a hotel near airport for 1 day  Return van and fly out of Johannesburg    Questions  Will I have issues with any part of the trip with just a van (versus 4x4)?  Any parts I should consider getting a guided tour? We like the flexibility of self driving given antsy babies/toddlers  Will I have any issues finding bathrooms on longer drives?  As mentioned before any suggestions on the trip in any way? I want to keep this trip relaxed which is why I have estimated 8 days in each of the first 3 parts. ,ahusain85,,"Somerville, New..."

I have a situation that I need answers/recommendations from someone who travels a lot or has had a similar situation. I will try to keep it as simple as I can. flight booked through expedia (first mistake!). flight as follows..... milwaukee to atlanta atlanta to jonnesburg both delta flights. connecting flight from jhb to durban on airlink. all bought at once through expedia. my plans have change a little as I want to stay in jhb once i land for a week or so and then catch the flight to durban. was originally gonna just miss the jhb to durban flight. just talked to delta customer service via virtual message. she claims that my luggage gets booked through all the way to durban where i go through customs. I thought you went through customs at port of entry. especially since I will be getting off plane and going up to the domestic terminal to catch the connecting flight??? anyone know the customs procedure for jhb? second she says that if I miss that flight that they can mark it as a no show and forfeit my entire return flight home!! Is this a thing? I realize the whole keeping track of foreigners thing but whats the difference where I go through customs? now if durban would be my customs port then I would understand.completely. I just feel like she is incorrect. I contacted expedia to attempt to just cancel that part but of course cant do that without cancelling entire trip and rebooking. double the price Im sure. I just need advise or recommendations. what and who to ask at check in etc. or am I screwed and need to make flight as originally planned??? thank you in advance ,robert M,Johannesburg,

First we were going to rent a car but someone told us that would make us more vulnerable to getting robbed due to car break ins or putting fruit with nails on the road. I have also heard not to rely on public transportation or ubering in Cape Town either. Last we were advised to just hire a private driver but that just sounds really expensive. I am confused on what to do because it seems like Cape Town is just a city of anarchy from what I am hearing. Our hotel is near the Cape Town City Centre alongside the University part. We want to visit Table Mountain the Cape of Good Hope Robben Island and others for sure.    Last random Questions? Does Load Shedding affect restaurants food quality?

Looking for some advice. We are planning a trip to South Africa For Christmas and New Year 2023. We will fly into Cape Town and spend about 7-10 days exploring this area we want to finish the trip with a safari. Ideally would have loved to do Kruger but after some research have discovered it will be rainy/ not the best season for spotting animals and high risk of maleria which will concern me and I'm not keen on taking anti-maleria medication. It makes sense to go to one of the reserves on the Eastern Cape like Amakhala/ Addo/ Gorah/ Gondwana but as such as special trip we really don't want to be disappointed will it really give us the WOW we are on safari experience? Or should we go to Madikwe or Kruger - is the maleria risk really bad?    We are first timers and I'm finding conflicting opinions and struggling to make decisions! ,Rianna94,,"Kent, UK"

It will be our first visit from England to South Africa this September and will probably be our last fly/drive holiday (we are both in our late sixties) As we will be driving from Cape Town to Port Alfred with many stops along the way I was wondering how safe it is to leave the car unattended (ie if we stop for lunch etc) as we will of course have all our belongings with us. I have also read a lot of posts regarding the danger of wearing of gold necklaces in Cape Town but does this only apply to the capital or is that unwise all over South Africa.  We are not the most technologically gifted couple and so thought that rather than downloading road maps or attempting sat navigation we would just buy a road map when we get there.  Does this sound mad to everyone or perfectly feasible? We have driven all over America but are aware that this will be be a different proposition.  Any advice on travelling in South Africa would be gratefully received. ,Alison Denison,Cape Town,

We'll be sleeping resting but want to see some of the area as well.  A hotel with an airport shuttle (or other suggestions) would be ideal. We are not so much history/museum people as we are outdoorsy. ,glycerin10,Johannesburg,"Shiloh, Illinois"
Good morning to all! We are a couple who loves diving and we would love to do the cage diving at Gangsbai . We are planning to come on May or in June and we have almost 10-12 days. We are also interested in activities with all the other creatures living in thesea such as dolphins seals penguins etc. Could you suggest us which month is better? Is it better to stay 2-3 days at Gangsbai instead of staying all the days at Cape Town?Thank you in advance. ,michellanna,,Corralejo

Hello All    Hope you doing good and safe. I am really nervous after watching all videos of flood in Kruger NP. Is this normal at Kruger every year? I see the road from skukuza to Lower Sabbie doesn’t exist anymore and this would be our last stop at Kruger in mid July. Should I reconsider my trip? Is there a fair chance that these roads would be repaired by mid July? Thanks much ,Sab,Kruger National Park,San Francisco...

We are flying from London the Johannesburg on British Airways arriving at 1015 and catching an Airlink flight to Capetown at 1455.

Hi  I have seen many posts talking about getting a SA SIM card when people arrive at the airport. If we contact our mobile provider before leaving the UK and ask them to ‘unlock it’ would we still need to get another SIM card?  We are not the most technologically gifted couple and it all sounds horribly complicated and I don’t fancy spending my precious three days in Cape Town trying to sort out our phones.  We are however then driving the ‘Garden Route’ and so may need to contact our many B&B places on route to advise them of ETA etc. Also would like to have some means of contacting people in case of emergency.  Any advice on this would be most welcome. Thank you ,Alison Denison,Cape Town,

Headed to Cape Town May 2023. Husband and I would like to take a Franschhoek wine tram tour from Cape Town. Need some clarification on options.

Hi this is real early days. One of my dear friends lives in Margate. My wife and I hopefully can get out next January . We would stay with him for a week then I like the idea of doing a safari for the following week. I guess we would need to get a flight to wherever for the safari. I guess we would have to fly to Durban then drive to Margate . Any suggestions on picking up a safari or perhaps which one. Maybe the location of safari could be as close as possible to an airport we may fly home from…….Thanks. ,gunboat,,cornwall

I'm travelling to SA at the end of March to early April and trying to plan the garden route. I'll be coming from Cape town heading towards Port Elizabeth where I'm planning on flying to Durban.    I was thinking maybe 1 or 2 nights in Knysna to ensure that have at least 1 full day and evening there. Is that enough time and how should I spend my time? I like photography hiking swimming water sports wandering around interesting towns and good food.    A few questions:  - Is it worth the overnight stop there?  - Any must-do activities in (or close to) Knysna?  - Where is the best place to locate myself? It would be nice to be next to the Lagoon.  - Any food recommendations?    After CT i'll probably spend a day or 2 exploring the wineries/towns and then head to the garden route. I'm considering the R62 route to Oudsthoorn and then to Mossel bay although not sure if thats the best route to take.    I'm also trying to work out where to spend other overnight stops out of..

We are planing our trip to South Africa this July. Cape Town first ( we are planning to spend 6-7 days) some business some days just explore. And then of course we are planning to go to Victoria Falls and Chobe National Park. We will fly to Victoria Falls and then we start our 8 days trip with AfricaZim Travels.(July 3-10th). They have great itinerary and price was reasonable.($3000 per person). But when we done with that we still have 4-5 days left before we depart to Chicago from Johannesburg. So we are thinking to visit Kruger National Park and of course do the Mpumalanga Panoramic route.  But we are not sure after seeing Chobe National Park do we gain anything from visit to Kruger National Park for instance different scenery or animals. Or maybe we can do something else in those 4-5 days.  If you suggest for us to do Kruger NP can you suggest great place to stay and what the best way to see all Big 5.  I will appreciate your advice in advance. Thank you very much :-) ,L-imaging,Kruger National Park,"Chicago, Illinois"

Can't wait to travel with my 13 year old daughter to Africa in August. We are having trouble prioritizing/figuring out a route from all the wonderful options. We are active and adventurous seasoned travellers. We like variety (bicycle walk night time boat/canoe and vehicle safaris) and know wonderful guides make a trip. Prefer more authentic bush style camps vs. height of modern luxury. Not sure if this is the best place to post this but couldn't figure out how to post in the entire Africa forum. I have read some things about dam building or poaching so would love to avoid areas that might be impacted by things a tourist might not know about. I know I cannot do everything listed below and I am looking for help selecting best of to plan.    Could you help me compare and select between the following:  Zambia South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi (Tafiki Old Mondoro Bush camp Kuyenda potato bush camp etc) and possibly Victoria Falls in August (but too low water?)  vs  Botswana Mashatu area Chobe Okavengo Delta  vs  Southern Tanzania: Ruaha Old River Camp Nyerere Sand River?  vs  South Africa: Kruger for cheetahs Tuli Wilderness Serolo Lodge    Wondering if say we do 7 to 9 days in Zambia can we do say Kruger or Tuli Wilderness on the way up there?

Hello and thank you in advance.  I am finalizing our trip plans and would LOVE to do the Tulega Falls hike. The dates we will have available are:  Sept. 8: Get an early start from Satara Rest Camp in Kruger NP and drive to Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge. This is my big hang up because it looks like it is a 10+ hour drive. My husband will be less than enthusiastic about that length of a drive (but oh well).  Sept. 9: Tulega Falls Hike  Sept. 10: Drive back to Jo'berg (4-5 hour drive?). We have all day because our flight back to the USA wouldn't leave until almost 10 pm.    The hike looks super cool. Most of our vacations are hiking centric (we hiked 300+ km in Iceland last September in just less than 2 weeks) and I'm actually a little concerned that being stuck largely in a vehicle in Kruger is going to have us chomping at the bit. We will do a day of hiking in Blydes Canyon at the front end of the trip.  How is the weather *expected* to be in early September? We would come prepared for anything but if that is a time of year that it would likely be rain blowing sideways or cold fog obscuring views then we would take that into account on whether to make the drive or not.  The Tulega Falls hike looks very fun cool and unique. Is it worth the drive on the big scale? We've hiked the Dolomites Patagonia Iceland all over the USA (particularly love the western mountains southwest and Hawaii) as well as volcanoes and backpacking in Central America ..... every place is unique. But some places (such as Big Bend NP in south Texas) left us saying this is fine *for Texas* but isn't really worthy of a top list globally and other places (the Fimmvorduhals hike in Iceland! Dolomites!) blew our socks right off.  I know no one can say Yes it's worth that drive but.......well I'm going to ask it anyway...is it worth the drive to do the Tugela Falls hike? :) ,DrDebi,Drakensberg Region,Rochester Hills...

Hello    We will have 9 nights following a cruise from Cape Town to Mozambique and back. We will already have had 5 nights in Cape Town and will have visited Pumba and Thula Thula reserves as day visitors.    Our plan is to drive to Kynsna for 2 nights then Gondwana reserve for 2 nights a night in Franschoek followed by 4 nights R&R in Camps Bay before our flight home. We love beaches and gorgeous scenery and the coastal drive looks amazing as does the road into Franschoek and the scenery around Kynsna. We also love good food but are not interested in visiting vineyards.    How does this sound please? A friend suggested it would take about 4 hours to drive to Kynsna whereas I have read on here it takes about 6? We would want to take the scenic route and would leave Cape Town around 9am. Is this too much? If so what would you suggest as an itinerary for our final 9 days.    I have read so much and every hotel guest house I look at looks wonderful……. So I am going around in circles. So many wonderful places and things to see.

Hey guys    I've been to South Africa twice (once to the Eastern Cape and once to the Western Cape) and I'm planning a visit in February to Stellenbosch. South Africa is one of my favorite countries but I always get the jitters before I go (combination of American media and family commentary). I had two questions...    1) My flight gets in this Sunday at 6PM and I have a transfer from the airport to my Air BnB at the Digtiby Estate just outside of Stellenbosch. My transfer is with Bosch Transfers and Tours...should I be worried about taking the N2 and Baden Powell drive out to Stellenbosch at that time of day?    2) Any major safety concerns in Stellenbosch or places to avoid around the town? And does anyone know much about the Digtiby Estate?    Any insight is appreciated. Most of the precautions people normally suggest for ZA are second nature to me (I was brought up to keep bags and other items out of sight when traveling in a car and to hide them/put them in the boot/trunk when parking a car for example) but I'm thinking of taking my work computer (to keep an eye on things while I'm on holiday) so I just want to be as safe as possible.    Thanks! ,namelessnewman,Western Cape,
I need to be sure i have enough pages in my Passport for my upcoming trip. HELP!    So here is my journey and what I think I need:    Johannesburg (2 pages)    Windsoek Namibia (3 pages)    Johannesburg (2 pages)    Victoria Falls (ZIM to ZAM to ZIM) - UniVisa (??? pages)    Johannesburg (2 pages)    I believe I need 9 pages plus the number required for the UniVisa. Does anyone know how many that will require and if my math is correct?    Thank you!! ,AnneinVirginia,,"Mathews, Virginia"

Hello  We are visiting Durban and will need distilled water for medical purposes. It must be distilled not just purified. Can anyone tell me where to go for this? Here in the states it's available everywhere but in Europe it's not as easy to find. We're staying in the Blue Waters hotel. Thank you for your help! ,Linda F,,"chicago,il"

Hey everyone    we are flying to Cape Town in one week and after staying there for 9 days we will fly to Johannesburg for 3 more days. Our original plan was to go to a safari close to Cape Town as the Kruger Nationalpark is too far away if we only have 3 days in Johannesburg. However we found out that Pilanesberg is only 2h away and would be possible to do in a daytrip.    My question is now would you recommend rather to go to Pilanesberg or Aquila Safari. Timing wise Aquila makes more sense to us as we have a lot of time in Cape Town. However I feel that the Safaris around Johannesburg offer a better experience.    Thank you very much for your input! ,Nebsi1234,,

I will be flying into Skukuza on the afternoon of Good Friday. I have 1 night there before heading to lower sabie for 3 nights. Can anyone recommend a drive to do that evening?    Also will I need to book a restaurant that evening or just turn up? (I’m doing the Sanparks evening game drive at lower sabie)  Thanks in advance ,Brian B,Kruger National Park,

Hi  We have a trip planned for July. The camp we are staying at you can opt for a plane (cesna) to take you or do a 4 hour drive with a driver. Im scared of flying and the thought of a little plane scares me. Looking for some insight from people who have either done the flight or have opted for the drive. Also if you do the flight do they have 2 pilots? ,NYC1240,,New York

Hi there    We are looking at staying in Skukuza rest camp this summer and have friends who will not be staying overnight but will be coming to the rest camp during the day. Will they be able to come to our accommodation for lunch and to chill out? I don't know whether there is anything which keeps day visitors away from the overnight accommodation eg needing to show room keys to get into the overnight area or whether everyone is just able to move about freely within the rest camp?    thank you ,destinationUnknownUK,Kruger National Park,UK
Hello  My husband and I are travelling to Cape Town in April with two young kids (1 almost and 4) and after many (many!!!) hours of research I have come up with the following itinerary.  Just wondering if anyone might have an opinion on whether it sounds right.  5 nights in Cape Town  1 night in Swellendam (to break up the drive as my youngest hates the car!)  2 nights in Botlierskop Game Reserve  2 nights in Garden Route Game Lodge  2 night in Stellenbosch    We want to be kept busy but not rushing from one activity to the next. I don't know if I'm making a mistake by spending 4 nights in Game reserves but seeing the animals is important to us and I think we (the kids) would be bored if we stayed in the same place for the whole 4 nights.  I had looked into doing internal flights to PE and going to Addo but I just feel it's too much for us to fit in in the two weeks.    We have one more night to play with but I don't know where to add it in.    Thank you!! ,Emma,,County Dublin...

Hello first time going Kruger what I need to bring? I heard that i need to bring the pill for malaria I see on this forum can be purchased at JNB airport. Anything else i need?

Travelling to SA soon for a holiday. Not been for 20-odd years. Was born there (so it shows on my British passport obviously) but I am not a citizen there anymore and haven't been for 25+ years.    Has anyone got any first-hand experience of travelling into/out from UK - were there any issues at security? Do I need to have any form of proof that I'm NOT an SA citizen? ,dfdsf423t,,

Early 40s couple we traveled but never having been in SA. In the process of solidifying tickets on points for a dream trip for the Xmas/NYears holiday but no clue where to start with when it comes to game parks.    Dec 23 - arrive in Johburg in PM after 20+hrs.  Dec 242526 - Kruger? It seems so far. Are there closer game parks for 3 days?  Dec 27 - fly to CPT  Dec 28293031 Jan1 - Cape Town. Maybe an overnight in wine country    How do you start with planning the safari portion of the trip? Are there game reserves that are closer to Joburg than Kruger? Looking to stay at a high end property but nothing insane price-wise :). How do you eve choose since they are all over? Are all the game drives typically included?      Any help would be greatly appreciated!    Thanks! ,Sergey S,,
hi all after ten fantastic days in Krüger we'll be traveling on Sunday from Berg en Dal to Clarens. We'd like to split the journey somewhere in between but where? Standerton seems to make more sense as it is closer to Clarens and we'd even have some more time to have a short visit to Golden Gate Highlands Park. Whereas Ermelo seems to have the bigger choice of nice BnB's and even some nice restaurants to choose from for dinner. Any suggestions much appreciated! Thank you very much! ,Yankeeacht,Mpumalanga,
Hi want to do our first time safari next year for my 50th it is my dream. Want to October time and split with Cape Town for Whales and Penguins!    Thinking to do roughly a week in each place. If we do a week in Greater Kruger area do we have to do separate lodges? Or if we found one with a larger traversing area is one lodge for 5/6 nights ok? Love the look of Londolozi….    When arriving in Joburg from London in morning can we connect to a flight onto Kruger same day? Have no desire to stay in Joburg.    Panorama Route worth it? Perhaps alongside a day or two in Kruger itself?  Thanks ,Dreamermaid,Sabi Sand Game Reserve,"Cornwall, United..."
I'm at the sanparks site and it shows me the following accommodation types. Can someone tell me what is the difference between them or where I can read about the difference? Please and thank you.    Main Rest Camps  Satellite Camps  Bushveld Camps  Overnight hides  Bush Lodges  Camp Sites - Probably a rustic camping site and if so not interested. We are city people lol  Luxury Sites - Probably can't afford them so will skip them.    Also would you advice to not stay outside of KNP to save money because we will pay with time?    Thanks so much. ,uvasag,Kruger National Park,"Detroit, Michigan"
My understanding is that there are/were road works on the N4 which are slowing down traffic substantially between Johannesburg and Nelspruit. Does anyone know if these road works are still ongoing or will end before June? I have checked Google traffic and there are very frequent delays on the N4 all the way to Machadodorp.    Also I have read an (old 2017) article that says that international credit cards or debit cards are NOT accepted at the toll stations? https://showme.co.za/nelspruit/news/automatic-electronic-payments-accepted-on-the-n4-toll-route/ Road users are reminded that debit cards Diners Club American Express and all other International Cards are NOT accepted methods of payment for any class of vehicle on the N4 Toll Route.    Is this correct?In any case I shall have some cash with me. ,Jmot,,"Valencia, Spain"
Has anyone used Intercape recently?Am debating about travelling by bus as have done it in other countries far east/Cuba  south America( many years ago). Trying to do my bit for the environment however am also not wanting to cause ourselves too many problems. I decided against the bus from Cape Town to Kimberly and have booked a flight as felt 12 hours on a bus that might be late was just too much !We ll be in Johannesburg for a couple of days and won't need the car so seems that is probably the least favoured option.

Hi  We are flying from CT to JB on 30/12/22 are initial plans were to hire a car and drive to Graskop (during daylight of course) for a few days along the panorama route before a stay at Kruger.  As with all good plans things sometimes need to change.....in truth I'm basically feeling slightly concerned about driving about too much due to sad recent circumstances reported in the news.  I am now considering altering our flight time to a much earlier time then catching another flight JB to Nelspruit. Both the flights I'm looking at will be with different SA airlines.  I am sure someone will have done similar and could therefore offer some advice on how long i realistically need to leave between the flight times to ensure we don't miss the second one!  (I have looked at flying direct but prices are somewhat pricey plus we already have one booked. ...which i am able to alter)  Many thanks in advance ,smallasapeanut,,Kingston-upon-Hull...
Hi All    We are renting a car to drive the panaromic route and at the end of it we are planning to take a private game reserve transfer from SZK airport and I had a question about returning the car to the rental location at SZK airport. I recall reading somewhere that the SZK airport is within the Kruger park and we will need to pay the daily fee to get into the park before reaching the airport is this accurate? If this is true is there any way to avoid this fee? (We will be picking up the car from MQP airport when we arrive from Victoria Falls.)    Any input appreciated thanks! ,neo_va,,Cle

Hi Folks    Currently in the initial stages of planning our Kruger Vic Falls and Chobe trip in 2024.    The first stage of the trip will be to travel to KNP. We've driven to KNP in a hire car twice before 2014 and 2019 on the Panorama Route entering at Phalaborwa both times. We've then done a variety of camps. We've also had experience driving on the Garden Route and through KZN.    We are probably looking at 9 nights at KNP spread over a number of (major) camps. Our first decision will be whether to fly from JNB to Kruger or to drive. We never tire of the drive to Kruger or anywhere in else in SA for that matter but we are mindful of what we perceive to be a worsening personal and road safety environment. Of course perception might not necessarily be reality. In 2014 we didn't give it a second thought (except when we exited KNP at Numbi gate). Similarly in 2019 we were not that concerned but must admit to being a little more anxious than on our 2014 trip.    So we would like to decide whether to travel JNB to KNP the same way as previously (never get tired of the Panorama route) stopping overnight at Graskop; doing a different driving route eg: JNB to Punda Maria (overnight stop to be determined) or simply fly to Skukuza fly back to JNB and continue our trip. Time is not really an issue.    Grateful for any thoughts particularly the PM option.    Many TIA ,GALESA2,,"Bega, Australia"
